We took all our classes together, did our doc qualifying exams together and moved through the doc level classes together.  We did everything together.

We tried to keep together so we could actually graduate together but that didn't always work out.  20+ years later and \"The Gang\" still stays in touch, we get together at conferences whenever we can to hang out.

The likely reason this student was chosen is the prevalent stereotype that Chinese college students are wealthy and carry cash, expensive clothing, etc. This is clearly not a universal truth, anyone with more of a brain than the fucktards who killed this man know that. But it is reinforced on many US campuses by the prevalence of clearly wealthy foreign students, many of whom are Chineese, and many of whom do carry cash, drive sports cars, and wear designer clothing. The problem is that they do not seem to be concerned with their safety or aware that they are targets. Clearly that does not mean that other races are capable of being wealthy. Clearly that does not mean that Chineese kids are not capable of being poor. The fact that you are trying so hard to prove that I think these things is confusing and I'm not sure what your point is.

Really, anyone with the opportunity to go to higher education is probably wealthier than the international standard. That's with my interpretation of \"international standard\" being a worldwide average of wealth. I don't really know what you mean by international standard of wealth, so I interpreted it in my own way. Factoring in all the people in rural 3rd world countries with no running water... I feel like they drag down the average of my definition of the worldwide average of wealth. \n",

      "My interpretation of your statement is kind of like you saying \"Hey, he's really handsome... definitely more handsome than a toad\". Yeah well, a toad isn't very handsome and you already said he is handsome so that's not really a good benchmark. Similarly, I felt like \"international standard\" wasn't a good benchmark to compare wealth to. Then again, I don't know what you consider the \"international standard\" which is where I substituted \"average worldwide wealth\" in. \n",

      "Hopefully that was more thoroughly explained in my example because according to you I don't English well.

Now I’m not saying she’s innocent. She may well be a psychopath. But I think it would be better for our souls to pause for a moment and ask ourselves whether maybe she really was a 17 year old girl in over her head, instead of rushing to cast the first stone. I have no idea how I would have handled a relationship with someone suicidal when I was 17. I probably would have asked them to get help...and so did she. Why did she send those other messages? Maybe she’s a psycho. Maybe she was confused and thought she could, in some perverse way, help him by bringing him to breaking point. She did specifically say in one message prior to the terminal sequence that she almost wished he would try something and fail so that he would get help. Someone up above quoted a message from after his death in which she openly expressed remorse for telling him to get back in the truck. Is that the behaviour of someone who was trying to get away with tricking her boyfriend into killing himself?\n",

I remember reading some of the texts at the time of her first trial and agreeing that she was awful  now I see messages that I never saw last time, including a sequence where she asks him to get help, and even foreshadows that maybe a failed attempt will get him the help he needs. I have doubt. I don’t know what was in the mind of that child whose boyfriend kept threatening suicide. Maybe she’s a psycho.\n",

      "I have thoroughly read the text messages from the day the poor boy decided to execute his plan to take his life, July 12th, as well as a lot of snippets from the entire month of June. I highly recommend that you all do the same before hopping onto the bandwagon of condemning this girl to a fate such as this. \n",

      "Michelle Carter for the entire month of June was supportive, very insistive, and showed genuine human care for Conrad Roy. I’d go as far to say that she tried every single positive possible solution to him over the course of this month through means such as therapeutic help and mental hospitals. She was very clear on her standing that she wanted him to get help. More than once she stated that if she were in his shoes she would seek medicinal assistance, further proved she already was actively doing therapy for an eating disorder. I make this comparison as both depression and an eating disorder are mental illnesses of sorts. Not once until the very end of June/Early July did Michelle ever show this curiosity towards Conrad’s suicidal tendencies. She knew they were in place, however it didn’t actively spark this mentality to go along with his plan to commit suicide. It wasn’t actually until Conrad opened up to her about the true extent of his suicidal tendencies did she begin to descend into the manner everyone here is condemning her for. Upon Conrad opening up about his attempt at water intoxication and investigation into various other suicide attempts Michelle changed her plan of attack. For a month straight this girl tried her hardest to help him, to convince him that help is available, but at this point I personally believe she took on a manipulation tactic to try and see if that would work. I believe what she tried to accomplish and what soon after failed to work, resulting in Conrad continuing his descent towards suicide, was an attempt at agreeing with him in hopes that he’d hit rock bottom. Upon reaching that state I’d expect she hoped that he’d agree to get help. I’m not condoning this, I’m just willing to play devils advocate. She trashed this mentality soon after and finally assumed, what I’d say is her breaking point, and felt as if this was the only option. This girl already suffered from mental illness. She had regular therapy appointments. To deal with this at the age of seventeen on a mature level, to me, is impractical. She loved this boy and I truly believe that she was helping him to accomplish what he felt was needed. On July 7th, five days prior to Conrad’s suicide, Michelle wrote that she wished that she could help, she wished her help worked. This is a human statement. That is nothing someone psychotic would say. She fought an entire month trying to reason with him in order to get help and failed. This was the only way and she knew it was wrong, but she couldn’t help. I can think of plenty of things she could have done. Outing his problems to his family and/or someone professional whom could treat his mental illness in some manner would have been the best chance he had at survival. I think a lot of people haven’t read the true extent of how Conrad felt. I understand that his mental state was in absolute shambles, but people are making light of how badly the poor boy actually wanted to die. He was adamant about it and I think that Michelle knew she couldn’t convince him otherwise. He trusted her and loved her. She was doing what she though was right for that situation. Michelle continued to message Conrad, daily, for the next two months, varying from texts of extreme emotional outbursts and wholesome goodnight/I love you messages. She tore herself apart over this and has regretted the decision, which she was also convinced wasn’t right, ever since. This is the emotional side of the story which I personally would represent. Also please consider that she never once implied or said anything about her wanting him to die. She actually said the exact opposite many different times. \n",
      "\n",
      "For the logical and reasoning side, this girl is entirely innocent for her actions, however her own mental health and sense of morality are in question. Words can not kill people. Your own brain translating words into your actions kill people. You are responsible for yourself be it a healthy state of mind, inebriated state of mind, and in this case a mentally ill state of mind. None of these things take away your own responsibility of yourself. Do they heighten and possibly broaden your spectrum of reactions when it comes to processing those words? Yes, they can, but you are still responsible for your actions including the decision to take your life. This is not a case of coercion to taking his life. Conrad already wanted to take his life and also demonstrated great interest in the idea through multiple means of research when it came to suicide as well as attempts. Ultimately he killed himself. I think people are are misinterpreting that Michelle had the chance to POTENTIALLY save him and did not talk him out of it when he did actively attempt suicide in his car. She also isnt legally held by law to attempt rescuing him, as bad as that will seem to many of you. From an entirely unbiased, non-emotional point-of-view, Michelle is innocent, although morally and mentally questionable. \n",
      "\n",
      "At the end of the day this is a conversation that metaphorically represents our society’s views on ethics. I feel as if I have an unpopular opinion here, but I hope to reason with as many others as possible. A horrible tragedy occurred in the loss of a boy with so much potential and it has truly cemented a rather troublesome view of words in general. I personally believe that words should never be prohibited because emotional and physical things can not be compared in the manner of weapons. You cannot physically kill someone with your words. Remember, people, we get to decide what we deem offensive. When people talk in specific ways around us, albeit racial slurs or sexist comments, we form opinions of those people. We can choose whether or not we like them, whether or not we agree with what they say, and also decide actively avoid it if we so choose. No one forced you to be around those people. I personally think words do have a lot of meaning, however to say that words directly said to another human being can have a physical component as well is just ignorant. That isn’t realistically possible, however legally we are trying to say otherwise. It’s very dangerous.\n",

      "I know this is going to be a VERY unpopular opinion here, but I don't think she should be convicted of anything for this. Is she an awful scummy piece of human garbage? Hell yes! But she didn't physically DO anything. He had the ability to stop contact with her and didn't. This case may seem clear cut, but where do we draw the line? If I tell you to go jump off a cliff once and you do, am I liable? How about two times? Personally I think that freedom of speech should cover this. Unless it's a direct threat, speech is completely harmless. If you let it harm you, that's on you. \n",

Similar to Michelle, the youth I know was recently prescribed anti-depressants (in addition to a long history of ADHD medications since a very young child).

I'm not saying these things should waive anyone of personal responsibility but I can't help but to see some parallels and could never imagine chastising the youth I know - as the child she is - as an \"evil bitch\" who deserves to \"rot in jail\" should she ever find herself in a similar situation.

I don’t know any of the info about that case other than general knowledge, but i read the texts with the girl named Allie, and wow, I would be very proud of her if she was my daughter. First of all, she doesn’t text and drive. Second, she clearly states how she feels and if something makes her uncomfortable, and encourages Michelle to seek an actual therapist. \n",

      "This was a very interesting read. \n",

      "\n",
      "She starts out with the texts sounding supportive/caring/loving and telling him how great he is and how much she adores him. But as soon as he mentions his suicide attempt it was like a switch flipped and she went on the offensive. Never stopping, always reminding him \"You won't REALLY do it\" etc. There were so many noteworthy parts... like the one where he says he is going to do it that night (one of the times) and she said that it was after 4 and too late to meet up.... too late? If you're going to see someone for the last time, is there such a thing as it being a bad time to see them? All she cares about is him tweeting about her, people knowing she was the girlfriend, being able to show off once he's dead. The disgusting way she romanticized his suicide while talking to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "I see a lot of myself in him. I remember obsessively researching suicide, worrying if my death/corpse would inconvenience others, saying a lot of the things he has said, venting out all of my hopeless feelings in the hopes that someone would care or understand or make it better magically even though I knew they couldn't do anything. I had people tell me to kill myself/encourage me and that did lead to an attempt, but none of them were at that level. I also remember them saying similar stuff \"Oh your attempt failed so you didn't really want to die! You didn't try hard enough.\" And I remember how it felt trying to get people to say that they would miss me, that they would be shattered, something because they claimed to love me....and getting shit like \"I'll be sad for two weeks or so\" similar to what she said in there. This is so incredibly heartbreaking and I have a lot of empathy for him. I remember trying to desperately talk other suicidal people out of it and I can't imagine being so calm the way she became. I wish he could have had someone else during those vulnerable moments instead of her.\n",
      "Every time news on this pops up it gets my blood boiling. What a disgusting human being\n",
      "Ok if your comment is accurate then she is clearly possessed by a demon who's MO is getting people to kill themselves.  Trust me, I'm on season 5 of Supernatural, I know what I'm talking about.\n",

      "You seem to be quite the prolific poster on this subject so maybe you can inform me - did they ever get into why he kept talking to her? I mean, I'm the kinda guy, the first time someone tells me to go kill myself, I'm probably never going to talk to that person again. Any insight without me having to read a bunch of texts? Was he hopelessly in love with her and she kept talking to him, making him think she's interested but then brought up the suicide each time, something like that?\n",

      "Sooo the argument is \"because I've said things via text that weren't urging this dude to commit suicide, this should cancel out the time I urged him to commit suicide\". I mean I guess if that's her only card to play it's unsurprising she'll play it. It's like how every time a woman murders her husband she will claim she's the victim of abuse in court. It's just the winning strategy in the court of law.\n",
      "I feel like the death penalty should only really be a thing with obvious sociopaths like this...\n",
      "I wonder if a stabbing murderer would ask for a retrial because the stab wounds were cherry picked. They only cared about the chest wounds out-of-context, but if they took into account the ones on the arms and legs that didn’t kill, maybe the sentence would be different.\n",
      "Yeah. But she still didn't force him to kill himself. \n",
      "I still believe if you can be talked into killing yourself, you deserve it.  She should be punished for being mean but she's just a bad person, not remotely a murderer or anything like that.\n",
      "I definitely can’t read those, and I’m sure a lot of people would have a hard time as well, so thank you for reading through everything and giving such a detailed synopsis for those of us who may have difficulties dealing with that. \n",

      ">This type of sentence construction has a history in English. The King  James Bible contains examples like “be ye not proud” and “follow thou  me.” Chaucer used it (“trust thou me well”), as did Spenser (“call ye me  the Salvage Knight”), and Shakespeare (“mark ye me”).  \n",

      ">  \n",
      ">Apparently not. The strange thing about “believe you me” is that it seems to be a modern innovation. In a [collection of 18th century English texts](http://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/ecco/), it  doesn’t appear once. (Neither does “believe ye me” nor “believe thou  me.”) At the same time, “look ye” and “hear ye” show up all over the  place.   \n",
      ">  \n",
      ">The phrase begins its rise with the publication of the 1919 book [*Believe You Me*](https://books.google.com/books/about/Believe_You_Me.html?id=REAYAAAAYAAJ&hl=en)*,* a  light, popular comic novel about rough-and-tumble characters who use  non-standard words and slang like “ain’t,” “says I,” and “holy smokes.”  The phrase didn’t originate with the novel though. It’s clear that it  was in use before the novel was published. The author picks it up in  order it to evoke the kind of common people who use it.  \n",

      ">  \n",
      ">Of course, the use of the phrase in Ireland might itself trace back to  the older English pattern, but it could also come from the grammar of  Irish Gaelic, where the word order is verb-subject-object. In any case,  as far as America is concerned, \"believe you me\" doesn’t reflect the  long ago legacy of Chaucer and Spenser, but a more recent development,  the slangy, boisterous, immigrant-led dialect of the streets that  continues to enrich our language with every new wave.   \n",

      "There are a couple ways this may have happened.  My best guess is that something similar to the following happened:  The prosecutor offered evidence of her guilt through the texts where she talks about suicide.  After a few texts the defense probably objected to the admission of further texts because allowing the prosecutor to read texts with similar content for hours creates a substantial risk of prejudice or is unnecessarily cumulative.  At a certain point, you can't continue to present essentially the same evidence without some other justification.  Maybe the judge stops the prosecutor immediately, maybe the judge lets the prosecutor go on for a while more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, the defense is allowed under multiple evidenciary rules to bring in evidence of texts that are contrary to the prosecutor's evidence and/or ought to be included in fairness to give context to the prosecutor's rightfully nitpicked texts.  After a few texts, the prosecutor makes the same objection the defense made, that the admission of multiple innocuous texts with the same content is irrelevant or unnecessarily cumulative because after a while, the defense is not presenting substantively new evidence.  Maybe the judges cuts them off after 5 texts, maybe the judge cuts them off after 500 texts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Depending on the available evidence and the judge's use of discretion in admitting and denying the entry of evidence, a legitimate argument could be made that a defendant was prejudiced.  Maybe the prosecutor was allowed to read dozens of texts before being cut off while the defense was only allowed to read three.   The jury only hears what the judge allows them to hear.  Maybe the actual phone records have exactly 12 texts promoting suicide and 400 texts condoning it.  Maybe there are 9 texts promoting it, 100 texts condoning it, and 4000 texts with irrelevant content in-between the 9 bad texts that make those texts seem significantly less damaging in context.  Even with a great attorney and piles of positive evidence, seemingly innocuous judicial decisions can turn a winning defense into a losing one.  \n",

She shows no remorse and little to no understanding of what she’s done wrong. \n",

It should be long enough for her to come out remorseful and useful to society. But even then it still leaves a bad taste...imo you don’t get to fuck up people’s lives, and so easily get a second chance getting back into society because you’re “reformed” or “good” now. There’s a karmic debt to be paid, and if people want to give her hell for the rest of her life, hey, that’s life tipping the scales. You reap what you sow...I guess it’s my belief that you should be conscious of your actions and not get tangled up in something like this in the first place. Is she young and stupid? Young, yes.

If you ever noticed she at one point tries to make it seem (she could have but my doubt in her grows with every text) as if she’s already gone through this whole suicide “phase” that Conrad is going through. An then makes it seem as if it was nothing for her to overcome. Also when he said he wanted to be left alone she does the “I can’t just leave you alone, you need me” there are tons of these moments where she tries to make sure he knows. In a sense she’s better than him. He needs her to do this either get overcome it or got through with it. But either way he needs her. An she loves that trust me. \n",

An she knows if ever gets a bit too distance she can use that common ground in a sense to reel him back him. When you look at the times it takes for him to reply back and the number of consecutive text from her to him with no reply. She USUALLY will make the last text something like. I’m really not doing well, or I think I’m losing it something close to that. Which always results in him responding because his emotional feelings in areas like that are so great he can’t imagine her feeling that way. An she picked up on it. \n",

      "She’s by no means well I agree. But she’s far from dumb and innocent. I think she suffers most from a lack of attention and control tbh. I know that may sound juvenile but I think it’s her biggest real problem. Say her eating disorder is 100% real and manifested. She could easily feel as if she doesn’t have much control over herself and her own body. So being able to control someone else into doing something this huge they have never been able to do before even after multiple tries. That must have been too good to give up the chance to try definitely while she is also getting moments that boost her own esteem. \n",

No one in her family or close friend group has died yet. She said people would probably grieve for a week or two and then get over it and move on with their life. So she moves into this role of being really supporting of what her boyfriend wants to do. Like if they were talking about learning how to play basketball shed be super supportive right? Like research all the different ways how to play basketball, get the tools required for basketball. You’re not going to learn basketball just sitting on the couch, go out and do it. Accomplish your goals. I believe in you. And then she feels betrayed for believing in something that could just be fake. Like she put in a lot of time thinking and researching about basketball, it had an emotional toll on her too. She doesn’t want to be the fool in this situation. Like, she thought her boyfriend wanted to learn basketball but he just wanted attention and now her pride is damaged because she believed him. It just happened to be the conversation wasn’t about basketball and was too dark for her to realize or relate to yet.\n",

Sometimes evidence or testimonies can be presented to a jury, only to later be instructed that they cannot use that information when reaching a verdict because the collection of evidence was done improperly.

However, some of the issues with drug use were apparent before prohibition started and in fact was part of the reason for prohibition in the first place (at least where heroin is concerned anyway). 40 years ago your line of thinking would be totally correct but the reality today is that billion dollar criminal industries utilize the drug trade and an end to prohibition will not make that disappear.

The reality is MAT (medicated assisted treatment) has far better results, the best results of anything I'm aware of. If someone can maintain sobriety without them then that's obviously preferred but not everyone can, especially early on in recovery. AA/NA/12 step programs heavily contribute to the stigma surrounding MAT and have undoubtedly contributed to preventable overdoses, discouraging people from seeking a viable treatment option because it's not the one you chose is straight up reckless. Yes in the end it's that persons choice but when they're in a vulnerable state and have multiple people who are sober telling them that the other option isn't viable and it's their fault for not trying hard enough with the program then they definitely have a hand in it.

There are checks in place for civil contempt, namely that they can only hold you as long as they have a reasonable belief that you may comply after some time. The way out of civil contempt is to successfully argue that, \"the defendant has already spent X amount of time in jail, has made it clear that they intend to never comply no matter the jail time, and keeping them in jail would not change this.\" \n",

      "The fun thing is after you get out of civil contempt, you can still be found in *criminal* contempt. The key difference is that civil contempt is trying to persuade you to comply with the court; criminal contempt is punishing you for failure to do so. The latter is not trying to persuade anyone of anything, it's a punishment for previous noncompliance. You can be arraigned criminal contempt *after* you're released from civil contempt and serve the sentence subsequent to being held in civil contempt. Sentences vary for criminal contempt as well, depending on jurisdiction, but they're generally much shorter than above.\n",

      "they're called run-on sentences and they're generally frowned upon \n",
      "I get where you're coming from, but I think that's probably not an entirely rational takeaway. People not into bdsm are raped and murdered by sexual partners all the time. Those people just aren't explicitly called out as vanilla by reporters.\n",
      "I mean, no community is without risks and problems, but this kinda shit in no way typifies people that are interested in BDSM or the kind of behavior that's considered normal. It's totally abhorrent and horrifying to everyone, kinky people included. If you want to explore that side of yourself, start reaching out and playing at public events where there's someone to keep an eye out. If you can bring a buddy, even better. If you feel fulfilled by your solo activities, then great, but if it's something you'd like to explore, don't let fear stop you. \n",
      "I’d add (for OP’s benefit) that the justice system works well this way. Each crime judged must be appealed separately. So if this guy has (for example) ten counts which add up to 286 years, he must appeal ten counts individually.\n",

      "Never thought of that. Still seems kinda pointless you'd just say your sentenced untill death or something \n",
      "I get that what I didn't get before was the fact Americans don't have full life sentences like us in the UK where I'd your crime is particularly henious your sentenced to a full life sentence meaning your only was out are in a box or if you get a retrial. \n",
      "I think the point is that it's a matter of statistics. People who get off on sexual violence and statistically more likely to be rapists than people who enjoy \"vanilla\" sexual encounters.\n",
      "That fast lane would be co opted by political agendas. Without the appeals process there might well be a pipeline to the death penalty loaded with the poor and innocent.\n",
      "It's probably illegal to jail someone for an indefinite amount of time/permanently. So the work-around is unsurvivably long sentences...\n",
      "We actually do have life sentences - they're just only used in very specific crimes, like first degree murder. You can definitely get sentenced to life without parole in the US.\n",
      "\n",
      "A 286 year sentence achieves the same thing, though, as you need a certain percentage of the sentence to be done before parole.\n",
      "Is this purely conjecture?\n",
      "Ah do yanks not have life sentences ? In the UK we've got a life sentence which is weirdly 20 years if I remember correctly and a full life sentence which means your not getting out unless your in a box \n",
      "Aye it seems to make more sense now didn't know about only certain crimes being eleigable for a life sentence. The differences between to countries justice systems are pretty interesting \n",
      "They have the same in the US. Depends on the state, but if I remember correctly where I live \"life\" means 30 years (so eligible for parole in 18) whereas \"natural life\" means until you die. That's why you get sentences like \"life + 60 years\" which seems pretty pointless if you don't realize life isn't actually life.\n",
      "The law is a little weird with its wordings sometimes eh. Cool interesting to know right enough \n"
