"So the best thing happened to me today. Just moved and need a microwave. I went to 3 different thrift stores today. The first two had boxed microwaves for 25-35 bucks. Thought meh, I'll keep looking. I get to the third store and see an unboxed microwave for 10 bucks. In my head I'm thinking, this will probably be gross and broken or dirty or missing a part. I open it up and it's perfectly clean. Clean and working  microwave for 10 bucks. Can't beat that "
[I picked a wedding dress out today!](https://imgur.com/iwDhugz) It fit me perfectly and doesn't need alterations. :D It was only $107!!

CONGRATULATIONS!!!!
Gorgeous!
Where'd you find that? How's the quality?
check to see if your library has Hoopla Digital too!
Which brand did you get?
Thank you! :D
"Local thrift store, used but still good & it fits perfectly "
The safety razor is a Gem 1912 and the blades are Gem brand themselves. Ten bucks on Amazon for a pack of a hundred. 
Awesome!!! Sounds like the best deal possible. 
"I served crudit√©s and ranch dip, egg salad sandwiches and cucumber sandwiches, Aldi pecan sandies and peanut butter cups. Already had a drawer full of assorted teas. My sister made the cake. We already had art supplies, but the low-end stuff isn‚Äôt too expensive - we‚Äôre not serious artists but had a lot of fun playing with the paints :) It was a beautiful afternoon and I‚Äôm pretty sure it cost me under $20 to entertain 5 people!"
I wish my grown children would see this post. This would truly make my year. This is going to be so much memorable to her. 
This is the cutest shit I‚Äôve ever seen 
"This is not only about frugal, it is such a genuine, heartwarming thing to do. I know your mom must have been much more happy for this than going on some fancy restaurant that doesn't have nearly as much personal value.
Congratulations."
That's a really nice setup and a very thoughtful present!
"Honestly, sounds a lot more fun and personal. Good job, OP! "
"Looks great! Not to be hyper critical and not that anyone noticed or probably cared (if I was in the room I would‚Äôve been 100% focused on the food) but, purely for aesthetics in the future and ‚Äòcause it‚Äôs easy to notice in the pic, the tablecloths could‚Äôve done with a quick iron. "
"This is just so rich, a high quality experience, beautifully done, for very little money.   The good life.  Well done!"
This is really cute and actually a great idea! I feel like every mom enjoys crafts 
"Sounds great!

Here's what I have come up with;

Birthday person gets to choose what ethnicity of food a week or so in advance, but whoever is doing the cooking decides the menu (within the ethnic group of course) and keeps it a secret. 

Determine an order for taking turns cooking and whose house you're going to use(we just go with whomever is the next birthday up). We also keep the menu simple (or inexpensive, so no one feels like they have to spend a lot) 

Meanwhile the B-Day person picks out a movie (to be kept secret) and is responsible for making sure they have the correct format to play the movie at the chosen house.

So you have a secret movie and a secret food (except the ethnicity). The cook maybe learns a new food group, and the B-day person gets to share a movie they like or wants to see.

 Hope this makes sense, I'm on my way out the door.

Reply if any questions."
That looks amazing! So much more fun then going out. I would much rather have had tea and painted then go to a restaurant. I may have to borrow this idea from you. 
"Very lovely OP, I did something similar with my mom. We all chipped in for food and my cousin made the cake, I used platters and table cloths I had myself, and even used my own vases for arrangements. I specifically made a point to tell those involved no balloons, no plastic cutlery, no plastic banners or decor. It was great! 

And not to sound like an old maid but iron the table cloths next time dearie lol ;)  much frugal love! "
Those are some thick lemon slices! Someone really knows how to party.
"Not my thing, at all. I will say it looks super classy and nice though. "
This is much more thoughtful than a restaurant dinner. Plus your mom wasn't forced to uncomfortably smile through the forced singing of waiters.
I prefer this type of entertaining.  People can visit longer;  can visit more people.    Can't sit at a table and do that.
Putting together a party like this not only is frugal but has so much more sentimental value.  Your mom is lucky to have such a clever and thoughtful you!
I love your tea pot set and tray! Where did you get it?
"This sounds delightful, we'll done! "
No way a bargain-birthday restaurant dinner would have been anywhere near as memorable and personal. What a great idea!
That looks fabulous.
"I hope she loved it as much as I would, this is amazing!"
I love this! What a fun way to celebrate. 
That looks like an ideal way to spend a day! 
Much more fun too I bet. 
So thoughtful! I've always wanted to do something like this for my own birthday. 
Sounds like my type of dinner :) 
You‚Äôll remember this more than the dinner at a restaurant anyway ‚ù§Ô∏è
"That cake is stunning! It‚Äôs such a sweet and thoughtful thing to do, too! Frugal is just the icing on the cake!"
"Cool looking cake. Did you make it yourself?

"
"First of all, this is the cutest shit ever and I‚Äôm definitely treating my angel of a mom next month for her birthday. Thanks for sharing the great idea!"
"Now this is my kind of party. 

I definitely will try this for my momma and MIL :) thanks for the amazing idea"
That paper is pretty good for the price!
"I hope you don't mind but I'm trying to plan my baby shower for the first of September, and I'm totally stealing most of this."
Lucky. 
You had tea? You're a madman!
I want a bday party like this üôèüôè
"My sisters and I did this for my mom's 65th birthday.  We invited over her best buddies and made them a gourmet meal.  In the end it was POSSIBLY less expensive.  But we got carried away and by the time we were done, that meal was pricey.  

It was lots of laughter and love.  And we got to know her friends.  
We didn't have the extra creative idea of the painting though!  That is a great idea.  

This is a memory that lasts so much longer than dinner out.  Even the making of dinner was fun for my sisters and I.  I recommend this to anyone who is wondering what to do for a special event for a parent.  It's a lot of work, but it's really fun too.  

PS - That CAKE!!  I love those colors.   "
In your BRA!
Tea game is strong here
"People have been doing those paint and wine party's. They pay $50+ just to paint and drink wine. I can do that at home for cheap, granted I do have a ton of paints and we like cheap wine."

"Nah, but actually for my bday I just like to have a nice dinner with the hubs :) I don‚Äôt like to celebrate with a big group."
"Well, they were mostly wedding presents, so my personal cash outlay was pretty low. But still, this could definitely be achieved with cheaper housewares or inexpensively-sourced ones like from thrift stores and estate sales. A couple of the ‚Äúsilver‚Äù trays are from the dollar store. And I have had all of it for 10 years and hosted dozens of parties and dinners using the same high-quality stuff and it still looks brand new. The housewares might have cost more than a few restaurant meals, but they will all last longer than my lifetime. Being frugal doesn‚Äôt mean never spending money on things and experiences you enjoy."
"Part of being ‚Äúfrugal‚Äù is investing in quality items that last over time while bringing personalized value to your life.  If you‚Äôre resourceful and creative, there‚Äôs no need to pay retail prices for a classic tea set like this, though in this instance if was a lovely gift.  

The way I look at it, you can spend money once on china (so to speak) and enjoy memories and a beautiful table setting forever, or continue to dump $10 bucks per event on cheap, unremarkable, disposable crap that thanklessly ends up in a landfill somewhere - which isn‚Äôt frugal at all if you think about it.

"As a seller, Amazon is tough.  I'm not a big time seller, but in the last year, I've sold roughly 1000 items.  I've only gotten 12 feedback on those sales, 2 of them were negative, both of which i immediately reached out to the buyers to make things right.  For example, one was an error on my part, but not something i would consider worthy of the backlash on me over it.  It was a puzzle that was the same series, but a slightly different picture, but they all had the same barocode, so that is how the problem came up, it came up  as one puzzle, and that's what I sent it in as.  Buyer left a really nasty review, immediately on reading the review, I gave him 100% money back, told him he didn't have to return it, and asked him if he would reconsider his review, and was completely ignored.  And I have 10/12 positive reviews in the last 12 months, which is 82% positive, which as a buyer looks very bad, and I'm sure those reviews have cost me thousands. 

"
Always contact the seller because they are willing to do anything to avoid a bad review. 
"Thank you, this is good advice. Amazon is very harsh with their suppliers so not adding to the fire is good practice."
"This is a valid advice for almost everything that you can buy. The warranty of the manufacturer can be longer than what the store will offer. I used to work retail and did a lot of RMA(return merchandise authorization) as part of my job. Our computers came with 2 years warranty, but many parts had a 3 years warranty from the manufacturer. I always look up the warranty period of a product with the manufacturer before I purchase something important, and this often makes the extended warranty of a store even more pointless once you know that you can just deal with the manufacturer directly.
"
"Depends on seller, there are plenty of assholes on Amazon, but I've also encountered some very nice companies that import Chinese goods.  It can be a crapshoot sometimes"
"I used to work as customer support for a seller, can confirm. If we could avoid a return, we did. Just as an added tip, always sort by verified comments when looking to buy, you'll be surprised at how many companies use 3rd party services to fluff their comment sections. And, corporate sabotage is rampant on Amazon. Often we would have competitors rate a product low on the SAME DAY as a new launch. Like, before any of the shipments arrived to customers who had ordered, we would receive a negative (verified) review. So, yea, if you talk to them, odds are they will be more than willing to help you out. If a company *doesn't* respond well to you reaching out (ignores for example) I wouldn't buy from them again. "
I did this with an Anker charger last week. They asked for my order number and what happened. I got a new one in only a few days. 
"Generally I've had extremely good luck contacting vendors no matter where I bought the product from. I had a product a few weeks ago that was so old that it had been discontinued by the manufacturer. I contacted them, and I didn't expect much, maybe a repair option that I'd have to pay for. Instead they shipped me a brand new unit of their current product line. I was shocked. 

Advice: treat the support staff great. Remember their names and use it. If you're on the phone with them and they're looking up your account or something, make small talk. Acknowledge them as a person. Don't get pissy with them even if you're having and experience. It isn't their fault. 

Support staff have a lot of power to help you out, so treat them right and they'll treat you right as well. Most of the time"
"I had purchased a flashlight on Amazon several years ago. The lens cracked way past the Amazon warranty period. I had it lying around, dad saw it one day and asked if he could have it. I said sure, why not, I already had a new one and didn't use it. First thing he did was call the company, and after he sent the original back, they sent him a brand new one. "
"I have done this. I contacted the manufacturer 6 months+ out of warranty letting them know about the issue hoping for a 10% coupon and they sent me a free replacement of the current model. 

I have praised the company prior to this and now I‚Äôm in love with them. 

This isn‚Äôt the first or even second time it has happened. 

Again I did not ask for a replacement. I just let the original manufacture know about the issue and they beyond exceeded my expectations when I said I purchased in amazon it‚Äôs outside warranty but xxxx happened. 

If nothing happened I would be fine with that as they were good products, 10% coupon as they were expensive would have been awesome but I have been fortunate to get replacements. 

Be kind people
Sugar vs vinegar is all I‚Äôm saying "
"Im really confused. Manufacturer warranties have always been longer than store return policies in general, and store policies are not a warranty per se legally. Is this a common way of thinking?"
Also a small time seller. Our livelihood depends upon reviews and low return rates. We always refund and/or replace :) 
I can confirm. I bought a grabby thing to pick up trash in my neighborhood because it‚Äôs really bad here. And the thing broke I guess it wasn‚Äôt made for picking up trash. I just contacted the seller and they sent me a new one without questions. 
Sometimes all you need to do is ask.
Contact Amazon since they will almost always let you return it...
Amazon is sliding down hill fast.  They are locking reviews and skewing search results like never before.
"Additionally, if you live in the EU, it has fairly stringent ""fit for purpose"" regulations that many are not aware of, meaning many electronics and I think other products have a warranty even if the manufacturer doesn't have one."
Amazon warranty? Since when does Amazon offer warranty on something they didn't manufacture? 
"My methodology for awhile has been ""always leave a review, especially if you're unsatisfied"". 

It takes only a couple minutes. In my experience if I return an item due to poor performance (i.e. headphones, etc.) the seller contacts me directly, almost immediately. I left a review on some wireless headphones a couple months ago and said how shitty they were and returned them. Couple weeks later I got directly contacted by the supplier and they supplied me with free headphones (the same ones I ordered). I received my refund and now I used their product for free (it works better than previous).

Moral of the story, if you're remotely unsatisfied leave a review. It gets noticed very quickly especially by large manufacturers, but immediately by smaller suppliers."
"Jesus, just stop using them."
This is really good to know. I gave positive feedback in the first instance and will do so again after I receive the replacement. I didn't realize that it was that hard to get feedback on there. Thank you for explaining that. I assumed that it was closer to Ebay. 
"Good god and I thought the rate people leave feedback on ebay was bad, only a dozen out of about 1000 sales is abysmal.

When I was selling on ebay I would estimate I got a ~40% feedback rate which is incredible compared to what you got on Amazon was.


"
I‚Äôm a buyer that hardly ever leaves reviews and it‚Äôs just because I end up forgetting majority of the time. I‚Äôll try to leave more. 
"Amazon can be nuts. They once froze my FBA seller account for a week because I logged in while I was on vacation and forgot to turn on my VPN. So different IP/country -> Froze the entire account and I missed around xx.xxx euros in sales.

But if you're missing reviews (which are quite important for your ranking) you should keep an eye out for special review services. We have quite a big community here in Germany we're they get a huge discount for leaving honest reviews. That's always the first thing we do after launching a new product to get the first ~50-100 reviews.

Oh, and another tip. Answer the bad reviews in a friendly and genuine way (Not via personal email, you can answer reviews on Amazon). That helps with new customers because they see that the 1 star review may not be your fault. So just apologize openly and describe indirectly how you gave him a full refund etc"
I recently bought tires through amazon. I waited a couple days after contacting pep boys and other local tire places looking for the tires that I wanted; they all told me I neee to order the tires online so I figured online is the way to go to get the tires I wanted. Is amazon going to screw me on tires? Or is amazon a good source to order tires?
I wouldn't have given the money back so easily knowing you had such a low return rate on reviews.
"With this in mind, I'd guess going to the seller first is the better option on everyone when it comes to broken stuff then?"
"I buy a lot from Amazon and used to be one of those people who were given a discount on a ton of products for review. So I make it a habit of going through my reviews every few months. I do not review bad products. I feel like if I have nothing nice to say, I should keep it to myself. I just return it and move on. "
"As a seller, I have a question for you. I received a product that had leaked in the package. Everything was damp, but the product was still usable, although I had lost a bit of the liquid. The product worked worked great though.  I got a request for a seller review and I have them 4 stars for the leaking problem, but mentioned that the product worked great.  The next day I went to review the actual product, and lo and behold, I was banned! I was going to leave a 5 star review, with a mention of the leaking problem. Do you think the two things (4 star rating and review ban) are related, and do you think, as a seller, I was justified in giving 4 stars instead of five?

BTW, I got the ban reversed, but no explanation as to why it happened in the first place, and I did leave a five star product review."
[deleted]
What do you sell?   You just profit on the markups?    Full time or part time? 
Not all of them I've tried with shit Chinese companies and they don't care. 
"This is true, I work for am Amazon seller in a shipping warehouse and we're always willing to replace or refund(and you keep the item) to keep customers happy and avoid negative feedback and bad reviews, which leads to less sales because customers are less likely to buy for your store. Not to mention all the Amazon penalties for selling bad items and bad service. 

Amazon's policy is your(the seller's) return policy should be equivalent to or better than theirs."
Definitely not the case with all sellers. I used to boyfriend's pants from some work wear company in Minnesota and they were a goddamn nightmare to work with. I think they have b&m locations and get most of their revenue through and bigger contracts with companies. They sent me pants with shit hems and it was like pulling goddamn teeth and took over a month to get them replaced. Amazon's a to z guarantee is bullshit with 3rd party sellers.
"Makes sense. One item was @ $10 and the other $30, so I didn't bother to look at the seller's warranty, but I really appreciated how easy it was to get it all processed. I'm definitely going to start leaving more feedback."
Good side tip
Anker is awesome about returns. I've bought four more items from them since my first purchase because of how great their support was. 
"I did the same thing. Charging wire on my Bluetooth receiver popped off. Despite having bought it 14 months ago, they just sent me a new one this week. "
"Upvote for Anker, had two chargers replaced over the last ~5 years. Completely hassle free. "
"Same happened to me with their Bluetooth speaker. I would hear a small hissing sound from the speaker if i had the music volume to low , so  i contacted them and they sent me a new one , no questions asked. They are very good in my book in that aspect alone.


"
"Politeness has always gotten me further in these situations.

Except for that ten month run around with HP 15 years ago. I spent hours, took detailed notes of times, dates, names. I somehow got a high up VP's number and they were pissed, surprised, and impressed that I kept it up enough to somehow get handed her number.  The disappointment was that they never resolved my simple problem. "
Who was it?
"That's the path I take. Just let them know I love their product but I/they have a problem with an item. I'll ask if there is a way to get it repaired. They usually just offer a replacement.

But I feel the same way, its better to ask and get nothing than not ask at all.

"
you would think but when stores try to push whatever warranties on expensive items they can people just stop thinking about the fact that another place is where the item really comes from and only remember about where they got it from. it also doesnt help that most products usually hide their warranty info in small text of the instruction manual that many people only ever look at once if at all.
"After hearing about how that can impact the smaller dealers, I think I'd prefer to reach out to them first vs immediately leaving a negative review. "
Huh? Are you trying to reply to another user?
I don't look a thing like Jesus!
FLEAbay constantly reminds and nags you to leave feedback.   Amazon does not. 
"This. Also, sending a follow up email with a direct link to a page where you can leave feedback helps greatly. There's lots of services available out there nowadays that can send emails to customers for you automatically, and is a vital investment for any Amazon seller, imo. "
"honestly, i don't know anything more than the average guy about tires, but personally, I would buy through amazon.  I can't imagine it being a bad place to buy tires, amazon usually backs up buyers pretty well if there is a problem.  The only question I have is if you have a costco nearby, or if your tires are super oddball or something.  I always use Costco, they are always the cheapest I've seen on tires.  My guess is even buying a membership plus the cost of tires they will beat Amazon prices, because shipping 100+ lbs of 4 tires, or whatever it costs is going to be expensive.  If you really don't want to get a membership, there is a trick that if you have a Costco gift card, they will let you use it there, so if you can get a gift card with $1 left on it, they will allow you to buy as much in the store as you want, I think you just have to pay cash for it."
"Did you try Discount Tire? Shopping online on their website gives you a much greater choice of tires (better tires, cheaper) than the ones they often keep in stock. They usually get delivered to the store in only a couple of days. I personally don't have any experience with buying tires on Amazon."
If you were banned for returning a sibgle item you most likely were in the wrong returning it
"Well, its a big company, and in large beaurocracies, there will always be issues with policies, when you enact them on large enough scales.  Its hard to imagine what caused that issue that they banned someone for one return, my first instinct is that is was something egregious, but honestly there is no way to know.  Amazon has a ton of amazing logistics that manage all parts of their business, but they aren't perfect.  Like, sellers have gotten banned because they used the same IP address as someone else who has gotten banned, like if they log in from a coffee shop, that another banned seller used, that could trigger a ban, usually in those cases, communicating with amazon can remedy the situation, but I've heard of situations where someone has a problem that seems like a simple misunderstanding, and they basically get stonewalled when they call into amazon, basically when they contact them they get, ""We are sorry, Amazon has chosen to not do business with your business, this decision is final and there is no way to review it.""  

Its a scary thing, there is a little red flag that pops up on your dashboard, I've had it a few times, but its usually been some minor problem like i had an item priced above or below a number that amazon kind of ham handedly guesses at for a price range, and while there is nothing against the rules of that, it warns you if it things you're outside of something's range in case its an error."
"I received something that was smashed in the box, sent both amazon and the seller an email with a picture and they straight up gave me a refund, didn't even ask for returns. It's usually better to just report a problem with the item than request a return. After I took it home I decided fuck it I'll plug it in. Hilariously, it worked anyway and I got my money back too. Gonna call that a win."
"I sell just about anything that i can make a profit on, but maybe specialize in housewares, toys, some more rare hard to find items.  Of course I profit on the mark ups, what else is there?"
"My understanding is that they run multiple accounts, so they treat them as if disposable"
I gave a bad review cause the seller listed stuff as shipped from Cali even though it came from China. They offered a full refund to change it so I left it up. I should have edited it to include the bribing. They had tons of items listed from us too. 
"I really appreciate knowing that. I wouldn't want them to agree to replace an item years later, but it was nice that they were willing to stretch the warranty to 3 months vs Amazon's 2 month. I also thought it was fair when they asked for a picture of the damage and their logo. They have to protect themselves also."
"Yup I ordered a few new items to upgrade charger stations.

I've also had good luck with Aukey. They sent me an item right away. The issue ended up being operator error."
"Awesome! 

As well I think I was days shy of 18 months, their stated online warranty. So that's awesome. "
I'm working towards one of those isses now. I've had a ticket open with Enterprise Google support for nearly 12 months. Every month they email me to let me know that the engineering team is still working on it.
I disagree. Amazon bothers me a lot to review the items I buy. 
"My fiance ordered a necklace for me for Christmas. It showed as delivered a week before Christmas, but it was not in our mailbox despite what the mail carrier said. We contacted Amazon about the issue to see what our next step should be, and they immediately refunded the purchase because the item was out of stock. On Christmas Eve, whatever neighbor who actually received it (because our post office *sucks*) put it in between our front doors! I was impressed by how quickly Amazon stepped in, but I felt bad since I did eventually get it. "
Really?    I've never reviewed an Amazon email requesting feedback 
To be clear seller feedback is not the same as product reviews
They ask me once. I haven't seen repeated requests for review.
They also only ask me once and not for all products. 
"If you feel bad and want to pay for it, give them a call and let them know that you did receive it. They have a system that would allow you to pay for an item that was previously reported as not received. If you don't want to, no big deal. They already counted it as a loss. Though your account might get flagged if you report too many lost items.

You were downvoted but I‚Äôm in the same boat. I‚Äôve never once seen an email from amazon asking me to review something I purchased. 
"I can only recall a couple of times that Amazon had asked me to review something, and they only asked once. When I didn't review they didn't keep bothering me. Honestly, my husband and I order so much off Amazon that it would take far too long to review it all."
Is one more valuable to the seller than the other?
"The feedback request is something that needs to come from the seller, a lot of sellers on Amazon don't really take the extra step to request feedback from customers. "

Make sure to check out which centers participate. None of the bowling alleys in my city are listed as accepting the program. 
"This is great, thank you!

Another note for others, it looks like different alleys have different age limits. One by me is ""15 and under"" and the other is ""17 and under"""
"Ah, my bad, I knew it was a nationwide program, just didn't realise that yeah, in some smaller cities there may not be as many centers that participate. In my city there's two bowling alleys within 5 miles of each other alone that participate."
"Oh cool, I didn't know that! I just knew that here the cut off age is 15."

Are you referring to the Twitch Prime portion? Would probably help to mention that.
"I second that! It astonishes me how few people know about Amazon Warehouse Deals. It's listed as a ""seller"" but it's literally just how Amazon resells items that have been returned. Out of the hundreds of items I've gotten at a discount this way, only a handful ever had to be returned because they were defective. And since it's Amazon, they'll pick up the return from your front porch just like with new stuff. "
"Especially for items that are durable such as pet toys, leashes, household items. If throwing the item down a flight of stairs won‚Äôt hurt it and it‚Äôs not going to be a gift than who cars about packaging. Happy savings!"

Mexican market. Especially if you don't have somewhere to put 50lbs of beans.  Black and pinto are $0.50 a pound at mine and you can buy as few as you want.
Costco has a 25lb bag of dry pinto beans for $10 or so
"Sam's typically or Costco depending on price difference. Sam's sells black beans dry, and pintos dry. "

"I don't have a mexican market near me nor can I justify having a Costco/Sam's club membership, so I get my dry beans from Dollar Tree. I find they are cheaper per pound compared to places like Walmart. Dollar tree pinto beans $1 for 1.5 pounds or $1 per pound for other varieties,"
"I dont know what the going rate is for 25lbs of dry pinto beans, but I looked at costco prices vs Walmart, Sams, Aldi, and Meijer and Costco always was frequently the worst, especially for things like bulk rice or bulk sugar.

I dont think Costco can use the 'quality' excuse for having a high price of dried beans. They are dried beans...

Might be worth doing the comparison if its a big deal. "
"Hmm...Costco beans are about $0.025 per oz

Walmart pinto beans are $0.05 per oz at the 64 oz size of their brand. 

1lb Goya dried beans are $1.49 at Target/Walmart/grocery ... Making them $0.093/oz

I don't have an Aldi nearby but I read online that someone was buying 2lb bags for $2.49 making them $0.077/oz

There is also no nearby Sam's club for me so I don't know the price they're. But if you can get them there for less, great.

As for quality... I typically first judge quality by cleanliness. Many brands of dry pinto have clumps of dirt or hard debris. Costco's band is one of the cleanest and doesn't require much extra work."

TJ Maxx
"Goodwill, Gabe's/Gabriel Brothers/Marshalls"
Why do you need special clothes for golf?
"As others mentioned, tjmaxx and Marshalls; but also eBay."
Golf clothes? You mean shorts and a polo shirt? The only piece that is specific to golf are the shoes.
Costco - Maybe - and likely only once a year.
Marshalls or Goodwill or local thrift stores would be a good start. 
"Many clubs still have dress codes I think. When I used to play years ago, women had to wear plain shirts with collars, shorts of a specific length, pants but no jeans or cut offs, no halter tops, and only certain types of golf hats or visors were allowed. T shirts and logo shirts were not allowed. Shorts or pants were typically cotton. Shoes had to have special spikes. I think some have relaxed their dress codes a bit over the years. Men's dress codes were similar although  I swear some didn't allow shorts. Sometimes what you already own is fine but if they don't allow t shirts and that is all you own, it's a problem."
"It‚Äôs been very hard for me to find women‚Äôs polos, especially in an athletic material. Men‚Äôs shirts aren‚Äôt fitted well. Finding discount golf brands would also be a bonus."
I‚Äôll have to keep combing through both! 
"Yes exactly, and although some codes may not be strict, it‚Äôs still an etiquette thing."
"I recommend looking in thrift or cosignment stores in towns that have a private golf course. Also browse the pro shop (if one) for ideas. If there is a dress code, everything they sell should comply with it. It will give you good ideas even if they are too expensive (very likely.)"
"Buy some caramel Monin syrup. Add it to some cold brew coffee. Add whole milk or 2&#37;. Top with a little full cream/heavy whipping cream. Then top with actual whipped cream if you're into that.

There's probably some other flavor (vanilla?). But I'd start with the above and see how you feel."
I wonder if caramel sauce like in a bottle would be a little more like the caramel swirl. I think it‚Äôs more of a sauce. 
I don‚Äôt know how to post a picture but if you google it the bottle comes up and you can compare ingredients 
"Dunkin is garbage, good alternative is sugar free black coffee "
Does Monin have the same consistency as the one from Dunkin‚Äô? I definitely want to try it but the bottle of Monin will cost $13 online. I‚Äôll take your word for it if you‚Äôve tried it before. 
"I like what I like. If I liked sugar free black coffee I wouldn‚Äôt need to ask for an alternative. Instead, I am asking for targeted advice in an attempt to cut costs. "
https://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/us_561baf08e4b0dbb8000f150f
Is the Dunkin one like a caramel drizzle rather than caramel flavored sugar syrup? Trader Joes has a decent cheap-ish caramel sauce that might work. 
"i have the chocolate. It's like any chocolate syrup flavoring. never had the caramel, though."
I‚Äôve never really seen it except from the outside of the bottle but it seems more opaque/saucy in nature. I will check out TJs next time I‚Äôm there!
"I use MintMobile. $15/month paid in advance. Unlimited talk, text and data (throttled after 2 GB). It's on the T-Mobile network. "
Look into red pocket or straight talk 
"I have my son on total wireless. It uses Verizon‚Äôs network $35/mo ($32 if you auto pay). Unlimited talk/text 5 gb data in NC

We purchased the iPhone 6 through them and it only says TFW on the upper left where you would normally see the carrier"
"I use Republic Wireless and use the 1gb $23/month plan. My office has exceptional wifi coverage so I don't use any data there or at home and when I'm not on wifi the cell coverage is quite excellent. I've had better cell coverage in the mountains than folks with verizon. The only issue I have with the service is the automatic shift between cell to wifi and back, it occasionally goofs and drops calls or if you are right on the border of wifi coverage (me in my garage for instance) it gets confused and won't connect to either. 

And yes, as far as I know the newer plans don't discriminate between 3G/4G, the icon I get is ""LTE.""

Another talking point is that you can have an existing sim card phone and if it is supported you can just get a republic sim card for it rather than buying a phone through republic. "
"It looks like it uses wi-fi when it's available, too. 

When you are making a call, does it require that you have 3G/4G data service? Or does a regular signal work? And does making a call away from wi-fi eat into your 2GB high-speed data limit? 

I am very frustrated with FreedomPop because the calls constantly get dropped and I often have no signal even though I live in a big city. :( 

I just looked at Sprint's 4G coverage map and my entire route to work (3/4 of a mile walk) is totally covered by 4G service according to the map. In reality, my phone barely works at all on my way to work. "
I honestly don't know. I don't use WiFi calling because it isn't compatible with my device. I chose to BYOD. You might find answers to your questions in /r/mintmobile hope this helps!
"I also have Mint. I think you have some big misconceptions about how your phone/service work.

1. Your current phone has Freedompop ""baked in"" if, and only if, you bought it from Freedompop. This is true of most carrier-branded phones. If you buy an unlocked phone, you won't have this problem.
2. Upgrading Android should not break anything, especially if it is a carrier phone.
3. Wifi calling / VoLTE are not charged as data.
4. Mint is a simple T-Mobile reseller, so you have unlimited talk and text. You will never be charged for voice, even if it is over wifi/LTE.

I also recommend Mint. It is cheaper than Republic as long as you don't mind paying ahead. Just make sure you have good T-Mobile signal. You can buy a test SIM on Amazon, if you'd like.

Project Fi might also be worth considering. It switches networks, so it usually has good signal. You also get Google customer service. The data is pay-as-you-go. It is, however, not particularly cheap unless you are a really low data user. You need particular phones for their network, but the Moto G6 can be had for $200 at the moment."
"> I think you have some big misconceptions about how your phone/service work.

You're probably right. I don't understand cell phones well. I have been learning about how PCs work my whole life, and cell phones seem so foreign to me. There's ""unlocking bootloaders"" and then there's ""jailbreaking"" and ""rooting"" and none of it makes much sense to me. All the resources online seem to either be for grandparents or for 1337 hackers who already understand. :/ 

> Your current phone has Freedompop ""baked in"" if, and only if, you bought it from Freedompop. This is true of most carrier-branded phones. If you buy an unlocked phone, you won't have this problem.

I did buy it from FreedomPop. The reason I say it's baked in is (besides the splash screen) that when I dial the phone, the app that I used to dial sort of goes away and a new one pops up. 

Since I happen to have google voice installed, there is also a popup that asks me if I want to use google voice. However unlike on most phones with google voice, my phone just continues to place the call regardless of what I press (or don't press). 

It seems that FreedomPop somehow latched onto a how-to-place-a-call hook, overriding the usual behavior (which would, e.g., actually allow the Google Voice popup to do something meaningful). "
"> Upgrading Android should not break anything, especially if it is a carrier phone.

I'm pretty sure this isn't true. I cannot upgrade through the system settings -- it says I'm up to date even though I'm on version 5.0. 

See this post <https://forums.freedompop.com/us/discussion/15259/updating-s5-android-os-beyond-5-0>: 

>  You'll need to restore the stock version of the OS and then update the OS, however this will wipe all information on the device. The reason for this is FreedomPop uses a custom kernel for most of their devices. "
"I don't know too much about Freedompop/Republic. Apps like Google Voice use data to call/text. That is probably why you always needed an internet connection. If you go back to a more typical prepaid service, you should no longer have these problems.

If your phone is Freedompop-branded you might be on the hook for a new one when you transfer."
"I see. That is the unfortunate reality of carrier-branded phones. I always buy unlocked phones, personally. They cost a little bit more, but provide more flexibility. For example, I can take my unlocked Moto G5+ to any BYOD carrier with full compatibility. I can update it whenever I want, and there is no carrier-specific bloat in the way."
"Also, I might be OK with keeping Freedompop if I can upgrade Android. I will just stick to their free-except-extra-data plan, and get MagicJack or Ooma to use as a landline telephone. Then my mobile's phone service would be emergencies-only. "
"Well I think it is unlocked (i.e., I believe it is possible to flash the ROM assuming I can figure out how to do that). Whether or not FreedomPop will work afterward remains a concern, though. "
"Unlocked phones typically refer to phones not locked into a carrier. Unlocked bootloaders are what allow flashing ROMs. If you were to do that, you might lose service temporarily. However, Freedompop has a BYOD program, so I would assume you could use that if your service fails after flashing.

I would not bother with the hassle, personally, if you plan on switching anyway. Unless you're on a really tight budget, I would get a new (or used) phone and move to a different carrier where you have voice/text."
Oof. Meant *partner.* My ‚Äú_parents_‚Äù were the ones who taught me this frugal tip.

"Thrift! Hit up thrift shops or antique stores and go early in the day. Ask when they restock so you know when floors are replenished. Don‚Äôt be afraid to refinish the pieces you find or worry about things matching too perfectly. Give it your personality and things have a way of flowing together. At the same time, don‚Äôt get in over your head with refinishing. In my opinion, painting a piece is easiest. Then staining. Then reupholstering. Just be realistic about what you can do and watch loads of YouTube videos to help you learn. "
"I want to give you a slight counter proposal to consider.

Consider not furnishing it right away. Definitely get the rugs. But, like let's say the living room. Let's say you have a couch and a coffee table. Just because your living room is now larger doesn't specifically mean you need to buy a love seat and recliner and 2 end tables to add. Give yourself a moment to think about what you need. Furniture needs maintenance, cleaning, repairs. The more you add, the more you have to care for and dust, etc.

My suggestion: put your current furniture in the new place and ask yourself what you really need, what would really improve your quality of life, ability to host guests, etc. Then during that time start familiarizing yourself with the local 2nd hand places. Solid wood, sturdy pieces are expensive to buy new, and there's plenty of time to add the RIGHT things instead of just ANYthing."
"I think you have a wonderful strategy! It helps that minimalism is so in right now ; )  It's hard to resist the urge to set-up a new home with purchases, but try your best to do so.  Decide a budget, what your absolute needs are.

My husband and I are on our second home, been together 7  years and one of our spare bedrooms is essentially empty. We still have some initial hand me down furniture, and very limited decor on the wall. I have got furniture from friends, garage sales, and from buying some fairly 'junky' looking old furniture and spray painting it.  It wont last forever but works surprisingly well without having to refinish. Also, look up ikea hacks, or just easy furniture to be made with 2 by 4 wood. If you lack tools, like a table saw, I bet you know someone who will borrow them for a short bit.  And if you think you aren't handy, I encourage you give it a try! you will surprise yourself! "

"Trash day (expect to need paint...possibly from the mistake isle or spray paint if it's a metal object which will be around $2 - $3). Modern handles can be had on amazon warehouse or borrowed from other tossed out broken furniture that you can't use. 

The restore can have great items that can look modern with a little paint also. Same with thrift stores (although I dislike Goodwill). Local apps like OfferUp can be great for rugs in good condition. Moving sales are always where you kind find rugs priced very inexpensively. Look for used, handwoven silk rugs if you can. They feel great on your feet. Be careful with cleaning them as Oxyclean will bleach them. 

Sometimes you can find an auction house that does a crazy auction once every couple of months for furniture items. I've gotten entire sets for $50 - $75 because people are going there for antiques, not solid wood dressers even if they're in good condition. Garage sales, estate sales of course. Those are hit or miss. Be very early to the ones with furniture. Don't be afraid to negotiate. "
"You've got to be cautious with thrift stores though. Clean everything and look out for fleas, roaches, or bed bugs."

Edit: Down voted for suggesting that folks be frugal on the /r/frugal subreddit?  "
"I would look at some appliance or repair subreddits. My roommate owns the dryer in my house and he's had it for many years. He's had two issues with it in the last 2.5 years we lived in this house, and he's managed to do the repairs himself by searching around online. 

Troubleshoot what is causing the problem, then find a video or two of how to replace or fix the part causing the problem. It saved him hundreds so far and the dryer still works perfectly fine. "
"First contact Aaron's and ask for a copy of the rental agreement, read it, and then determine what your options are for fixing it. No point in discussing the issue with them until you read the agreement because it may have a tech support or repair service phone number or procedure in it. "
We've tried that before back home. The first washer we bought used the agitator broke within the first 3 weeks....then the replacement washer we got from the place the tub wouldn't hold water. We put a load of laundry in to wash and started filling the tub with water...water all over the floor of apartment. We've decided never again with those used places..
"I've looked at appliance subs and they seem pretty dead really, not a lot of activity going on. Also we dont own the dryer, so as long as were still actively making monthly payments on the device isn't it there responsibility to fix any issues? "
Doesn't sound like you are having much better luck with new ones.  I bought our washer and dryer for $250 in 2014 and they are still going strong.
"I actually used to do real estate and some apartment leasing stuff, but it's all going to come down to the contract you signed.

"It wasnt new when we got this one from Aaron's, its pre owned. "
"You will likely pay as much or more than a new one would cost once the financing is through.  I regularly see washers and dryers for sale on Craigslist and Facebook marketplace for $100 or less apiece.  Same goes with many other consumer items like furniture, cars, tools, and clothes.  "

"Here is a tip that will save you money, buy clothes from Salvation Army. I have bought brand new clothes from there with the tags. You just have to be patient and go through their stuff. I have gotten, banana republic, express, polo, all major brands stuff for very good deals. On certain days they have 50% off as well. 

Make sure you try them out their first to make sure of the fitting and wash them when get home before wearing them. "

I don't care at all for designer brands but I will buy them from op shops just because it's so awesome getting compliments on my clothing and gleefully stating that I got them for $6 or whatever.

"I was in a relatively low-speed accident (~25 mph, on a small side street) recently where someone hit me at the front-drivers-side-wheel, which threw my head sideways towards the window.

"I have a 2000 Civic that I bought new, and it's fun to drive and I'm fond of it, but we have three cars and it's on the chopping block... Every time I think about keeping it and fixing the minor problems it has, it's the lack of modern safety standards that seal the sale notion..."
"There are plenty of cars that have side impact or side curtain airbags prior to 2009. My 2002, 2005, and other 2005 vehicles all had them. It's a good to thing to check, but I wouldn't limit my search to 2009 and later just because it was made mandatory that year."
"Eh cars are getting safer all the time. My ‚Äúunsafe‚Äù 2006 compact is leagues ahead of a 1996 car, and the 1996 car is way safer than a 1986 car.

I guess my point is new cars were always safer and always will be. There‚Äôs always something that you ‚Äúhave to have to be safe‚Äù. 5 years ago it was ABS/ESC. Since almost everyone has that now, now it‚Äôs blind spot detection, emergency braking and lane departure warnings. It‚Äôs the definition of moving goalposts.

I‚Äôm not saying safe cars are a bad thing, and it‚Äôs defense something to keep in mind, but overextending yourself and getting a 2014 car, while being unable to get new tires and brakes is worse than getting a 2006 car and keeping it fully functional.



"
"I didn‚Äôt buy a car until now (I‚Äôm 23) largely because so l couldn‚Äôt afford one, but I went straight for a Mazda 2 sport 2015 because it was a very safe car with side / passenger airbags, anti roll back things and this thing where it stops by itself if I don‚Äôt stop in time (which baffles me but there you go). 

Everyone I told said I should get an old shitty car to start with in case I crash it /scratch it etc but I said I‚Äôd rather scrap an expensive car that saved my life, rather than risk my life in an old banger which might not protect me. I‚Äôve also got a window smasher / seatbelt cutter in case shit hits the fan but that‚Äôs my own preference. "
"How many of those 25% would have been saved by airbags though? I don't ask this because I doubt the effectiveness of the airbags, just that the airbags wouldn't have prevented 100% of those 25%

Some straight up t-bone crashes are going to be fatal regardless of safety features."
There are some things you don‚Äôt want to be frugal with. Safety is usually up there. 
"So the remaining 75% were front and rear impact? Also what percentage of accidents are side impact? I always vote for more safety features, but it‚Äôs incredibly easy to spin a statistic out of context. "
"And what about those with vehicles parked still awaiting takata air bag replacement, or sitting parked with no one even taking it in for a replacement?"
"The problem is you are taking a percentage of a percentage and acting like it's anything at all. 

0.01% of people will be in a fatal car crash each year in the US (37461 in 2016) So you are saying 25% of 0.01% or 0.0025%.  Is it worth paying $20,000 more for a car to reduce your risk by 0.0025%.  That's a personal decision. 

The interesting thing for me is, in 2008 there were actually less fatal accidents. 

"
Pretty nuts my '97 Volvo had them side impact bags all the way back then.... what a great car company.
"I know this is /r/frugal, but if you buy a new car and drive the shit out of it for 10 years, then sell and do it again you really don‚Äôt come out too far behind from people recommending buying a used 2 year old car every five years. "
"I was in an automobile accident in 2005.  The other driver died, I survived.  I had curtain air bags and although I was pretty messed up (crushed foot, lost part of a finger) I lived.  "
"Point taken. This year we upgraded to a 2009 Forester for our family/camping car largely for this reason.

I would argue that the greatest factor in whether you are likely to die in a car crash is time spent in a car.

When I drive a 1997 Corolla, people question me about safety.

I live close to work (5 min drive) and usually bike to work on safe sidestreets. I have 3 coworkers that each drive 2-3 hours roundtrip in newer cars. Nobody asks them about risking their safety because of increased exposure time."
75% weren‚Äôt. Now that we‚Äôve established that...
Every few years there is a jump forward in safety technology/regulations that makes getting a newer car much more preferable to a used car.  We are in another phase of that right now with all the safety sensor technology being put into cars now.  The sensor technology in a modern Altima rental car saved me from an accident recently.
"When buying our used car, we used whether the car has Electronic Stability Control as our cut-off for what years we would consider (that meant it would have Side Air Bags too since ESC is more recent):

Electronic stability control a/k/a dynamic stability control (DSC): improves stability by detecting and reducing loss of traction (skidding).

Required for 2012 and later (some brands implemented earlier, but within a brand it varies based on the exact model) in the US; earlier in Europe I believe.

""According to the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety in 2004 and 2006 respectively, one-third of fatal accidents could be prevented by
the use of the technology.""
per https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_stability_control

The NHTSA requires all new passenger vehicles sold in the US to be equipped with ESC as of the 2012 model year, and estimates it will prevent 5,300-9,600 annual fatalities.

I heard that the level of safety benefit from ESC is major, comparable to the benefit of equipping cars with seatbelts."
My car is from '96 ahah
"Airbags save thousands of lives so this is really something to think about

I was in my friends car going 100kmph (the speed limit) on a backroad when a kangaroo jumped in front of the car and absolutely destroyed the car, both of us walked away without a scratch because of the airbags, if there wasn‚Äôt any we would have been dead for sure"
"Automatic braking is on many recent economy cars (even in lesser trim levels). That technology pays for itself for many people in that it helps avoid fender benders. Even a minor repair may cost more to fix than that safety technology cost to equip. According to [this article](https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/27/10854478/iihs-collision-warning-autobrake-volvo-city-safety-research), the technology has already reduced the rate of rear-end crashes by 39 percent and rear end crashes with injuries by 42 percent."
"Full disclosure: I work for a car manufacturer.

I am glad to see this posted here as we (manufacturers) have invested a lot in improving safety in our vehicles year over year. I‚Äôd imagine safety improvements in general are on par with advances in fuel economy and technology/infotainment.

Something to be considered when shopping for a vehicle."
"Safety should be your NUMBER ONE priority when buying a vehicle. Price is important, yes, but do not sacrifice your safety to save a little bit of money. "
Cant be frugal when you are dead.
How many of those deaths would have been saved by side impact airbags?
"Someone doesn't understand statistics.

Since there are now mandatory airbags and seatbelts, the overall number of fatal car crashes have dropped.  And because seat belts and steering wheel/dashboard airbags have been standard for a while, the proportion of fatalities from head on collisions is far lower, meaning that something which was relatively rare appears to be a greater hazard. There are still relatively few fatalities from side impacts, but the proportion seems higher because other deaths have declined so drastically.

 "
Cheaper insurance too if it's safer. 
Great post! I have a 2006 Corolla I love but am upgrading primarily because it doesn‚Äôt have side airbags.
My fiance died recently and it was a side impact crash. No airbag would have saved him. A truck collided with his vehicle.  
I've responded to many bad motor vehicle accidents where the occupants involved are just walking around complaining of soreness. Twenty years ago the same people would have died in the same accidents. Cars nowadays are unbelievably safe and a majority of accidents are survivable due to that reason. 
So... 75% of the accidents weren't side-impacts? Doesn't that kind of logic mean that you should focus on other accidents rather than side-impacts?
That's why I'm scared to fall asleep in a car leaning my head to the side now. If a car hits you there it hits your head. 
Great explanatory video - https://youtu.be/U6gNknUQbio
"I thought about getting a newer car, but I didn't. Then all newer cars had to be recalled in my country because the airbags are all faulty ü§∑. "
"I drive a 94 Camry. I'm going to continue driving it at least another 2 years... 
 
Also something to consider are the crash tests. However, I must recommend you proceed with caution if you drive an older car that you plan on driving more. It's kind of terrifying. "
Thank you. Sending this info to my husband for when we get another car soon. 
Are side airbags mandatory in the US ?

"Tesla vs Volvo in side impact

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prantu6RNgI"
Note: the 2018 accent has great crash test ratings.
"Mandatory in 2009 you say? I did not know this. I know some vehicles had side airbags as far back as 1999, but never knew when it became mandatory. To add to that, tire pressure monitoring (TPMS) became mandatory in 2008 I think. And backup cameras are now mandatory this year as well(though I'm not sure which month it was enacted, there are still SOME model year 2018 vehicles without them). In the American market that is, can't speak for overseas regulations."
Only drive in circles.
That's not to say that a car manufactures pre 2009 won't have a side airbag. European cars started to widely adopted SAB in the late 90s and very early 20s. US cars became popular during a similar time frame
"I've seen a lot of vehicles after a crash. The worst part is often intrusion from either the roof, or the A/B pillars. or intrusion through the door window. Side impact airbags are an absolute must, because the side of the car has literally 0 protection (apat from low down bars in the door) and no crumple zone."
My brother lost part of his finger when his hand hit the window in a crash.  The tip came right off. They reattached it partially but he still has a slightly shorter left index finger and his nail looks weird. 
Think about how much you'd save by being dead
Just made it with my 09 Corolla.
"While statistically true, statistics can be misleading. Out of all those crashes how many vehicles swerved to cause a side impact versus either hitting it direct on? A lot of vehicles were engineered well before 2009 to employ a crumble zone in the engine frame which could have possibly saved a number of lives in the source you quoted."
"Considering the side of the car makes up around 50% of the area of the car that could be impacted, I actually kind of like those odds!"
But being dead allows for no more debt or spending. Being dead is the cheapest way to go

"And here's why I drive a Volvo:
https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/02/automobiles/driving-smart-the-first-side-impact-air-bags-how-volvo-s-system-works.html

In 1994 Volvo started offering side impact airbags. Used Volvos are a great deal, just find one that's been gently used. Maintenance is slightly more than other cars, but we believe it's worth it. Now Volvo offers lifetime warranty on repairs for many items that should last a long time (not for things that do wear with age such as tires and brakes). So I think it works out to be even or better with a Volvo (that alternator I replaced will be replaced free parts and labor for as long as I own my car). 

Friends on a Volvo forum about a year or so ago were hit head on in their V60, they were thrown over the railing and rolled down an embankment. They said they were protected like they were wrapped in pillows. They climbed out the sunroof, carrying the baby in the infant carseat, and not a scratch on them as they hiked up the embankment. The Nissan driver or passenger that hit them was airlifted to the hospital. I never forgot that story. There's a reason why the Volvo motto is ""Volvo for life.""

"
"My 2007 Honda Pilot has side curtain air bags. So when buying used, just be sure to check and see what safety features the car has. The manufacturer may have been building to a higher standard than the law required."
"I struggle with the marginal utility of this when you already have an ancient car that runs fine. I have a 2005 Mercury Grand Marquis with 81,000 miles. No mechanical issues, the only problems are people think I'm a drug dealer and it is a gas guzzler. It'll probably last 5 more years without major issues.

I could easily afford a new civic, but how much am I really improving the chance that I'll survive a crash?"
I‚Äôm all for being frugal but safety is one area I will not be frugal with. What good is saving money if you can‚Äôt protect yourself and you get injured or hurt? We can‚Äôt all afford new cars but getting a newer car with higher safety standards should be a priority.
"Let's talk about the psychology of risk compensation:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_compensation

""By way of example, it has been observed that motorists drove faster when wearing seatbelts and closer to the vehicle in front when the vehicles were fitted with anti-lock brakes.""

If you believe that this is human nature (I do), then new safety measures are needed because cars drive more aggressively than the way drivers drove in the in earlier decades. You kinda need the side-impact airbags and the better braking just to keep up with the driving behavior or others on the road driving in a more risky way.

I agree that minimizing miles drives is one of the safest things someone can do to reduce risk."
You can pick up an excellent used motorcycle for under 3000 dollars.  Fuel economy is typically wonderful as well
"I drive/ live out of a 96 Tacoma with no airbag because it was already used up in a crash, the seatbelt is tied back together, guess the previous owner had to be cut out... Oh and the speedometer and odometer don't work along with no A/C but it drives and has an aux cord so I'm stoked. "
My first truck didn't even have airbags and the seatbelts were aftermarket and jerryrigged in place. Sure a new car might be best but not everyone has money for that

I actually didn‚Äôt even know side airbags were a thing. My head bounced onto the airbag to my left. There was a loud ringing in my ear, my head hurt, and I was terrified to look at my left shoulder because I thought I‚Äôd see bruising or bleeding. There ended up being no physical damage to me at all, but my 1 year old car ended up totaled.

To further reinforce your data points: I have a 2000 model year and have both side impact and side curtain airbags. 
Can confirm. My first car was a 2004 accord and it had side airbags. 
"Right, they were optional until 2009."
Just looked into it. My 06 Acura has them too. Feel a bit better now as safety was always in the back of my mind. Still want to get a newer car once I'm done with my loans. 
"This. My 1997 and 1999 cars have side impact airbags (and no, they're not my daily drivers). One benefit to European luxury cars is that they're on the forefront of technology. "
For sure! I had a 96 Mercedes E 320. I believe this was one of the first cars with side airbags. 
"Yep, and my Prius had leg airbags, as I found out (for the driver), which was pretty nice during a crash, as I tend to sit extremely close to the front dashboard with my long legs almost pressed against it (I'm 6ft2in). The car is actually very spacious and feels more comfortable than an average sedan I've been in. As a result, my legs didn't get hurt at all during the crash, nor did anything else (the seatbelt restrained me from smashing into the deployed airbag). "
Were they made mandatory as an option in '09?  My '16 Wrangler doesn't have them.  They were an option that was offered though.
"Yeah they key here is to look at the safety rating of the car, no matter the age. I mean there'd be no point buying a car with side curtains but that doesn't protect adequately from head on collisions. "
"This argument always works out well until you have a loved one killed in a car accident that could have been prevented. It‚Äôs a very low risk, but if it happens you‚Äôll wish you could trade that couple thousand bucks you saved for them. 

Source: parent died in a car accident that would have been prevented with modern tech"
"Good point that the goalposts continue to move. But some of the improvements are more minor and merely linear, and the price changes linearly too. Whereas other times the safety improvement looks more like a hockey stick. At that point, going a year or two farther back gives you only a minor monetary savings while losing you a more substantive safety benefit."
The difference between having side impact air bags and not (and my head traumatically slamming in the column or not) is the difference between me having a career and not. There‚Äôs no price I can put on protecting my brain.
"Look down at your phone once and most of those features go out the window.

Another interesting point is that with more active safety features in the vehicle fleet, my old POS actually gets safer too!"
"In addition, some safety feature make cars less safe. I'm not talking about airbags hurting you but the size of the pillars. I went from a 2000 Ford Escort to 2013 Honda Fit. The front pillars are so big, I frequently have to move my head around to see what entire cars are hiding in those blind spots."
"So true! You‚Äôre right, it‚Äôs ridiculous to buy a new car every year just because it has new bells and whistles. People tell me ‚ÄúBack in my day we didn‚Äôt even use seatbelts and we all turned out just fine!‚Äù, buuuut you can‚Äôt get around the fact that you will still be safer in a safer car.

One of my best friends died in a car accident. They were driving home from a road trip and she was sleeping in the passengers seat. Her bf who was driving dozed off and went off the road. The car had side airbags and he lived. Those side airbags almost certainly would have saved her life too except she had her seat reclined so she wasn‚Äôt positioned correctly for them to be effective.

My hubby is a mechanic and I could easily make a car last me a long long time but I upgraded because I want to drive the safest car I can afford. I also never recline my seat or sleep while the car is in motion. On road trips I make it my job to make sure the driver stays awake. These things change you. "
"Obviously, don't buy a car you cannot afford. Buying/driving an older car than you can afford to save money is false economy. "
"Yep. Think about car seats. I mean, I'm only 36 and I can't remember every having a car seat past being a baby."
"The car can be fully insured, you can't be. A life long injury can't be fixed with money.

In Norway parents are adviced to let the children drive the newest cars and drive older cars themselves. But many buy them a piece of junk for $1200 with sketchy maintenance.

Be sure the window smasher / seatbelt cutter is secured. You don't want it smashing your face if you crash (unless its one of them tiny plastic ones that weigh nothing).

Another thing you should have is high vis vests for all the occupants. We mandate one, but if you have to stop and help at a crash and only one have it they are at great risk. A teen died here going to fetch jackets while they were helping someone that drove off the road. He didn't have a vest and got hit by another car. The vests costs almost nothing, and can increase safety dramatically if you have to exit the car in the dark (blown tire, accidents, go to pee). Keep it within arms reach."
"What are ""anti roll back things'? If you meam anti roll bars, aka away bars, all cars have them. "
"What's your point exactly? Even if only 50% of those fatal car crashes could've been non-fatal thanks to extra safety precautions it still would've saved *thousands* of lives.

If we were to accept that a safety precaution is justified only if it has a 100% survival rate, then we could systematically dismantle every existing safety feature until nothing remains."

You have a point.  Most of the deaths in 2016 were from frontal impacts and front airbags have been mandatory since 1993."
Obviously airbags don't stop all fatalities
At some point you can‚Äôt defeat the laws of physics.
"Yeah, I was going to say, sounds like those air bags aren‚Äôt really helping then, if side impact fatalities are really that high. "
"Im with this, but this quickly becomes a:  


Well you NEED auto stop, what if you forget to stop, you might die...

you NEED lane detection...

  
Etc..."
"About 50 percent are frontal, the rest were listed as Other such as a roll over"
"What's ambiguous about what was said? If 25% of fatal crashed were due to side imapct, then the remaining 75% are just the complement of 25% (everything else).

That's not a spin."
"I just bought a used 2017 for $16K. You‚Äôre going to spend at least $5-10 on a ten year old vehicle. That‚Äôs not an ‚Äúextra‚Äù 20 grand.  

I grew up in the 10K cars. My husband had to work hard to do it, but he has convinced me it‚Äôs worth it to spend a little more. You just have to be smart about it. There are decent newer cars out there for well under 20."
"Because in 2008, we had the one thing that actually reduces fatalities: higher gas prices causing people to drive less. And when they did drive, they drove smaller more fuel efficient cars that cause less damage. 

Disincentivizing driving does a lot more for road safety than adding safety features does. "
"The most dangerous road in the US is US-1 in Florida, which has an incident rate of 2.8 incidents per MILLION vehicles driven. Florida has six of the ten most dangerous roads. The chances of being in an accident are actually very low.  They're even lower if you are over 30 years old and aren't my good friend Brad.

Still, even though the odds are low, I still like to plan for the worst."
That's because the iPhone 3g didn't come out till halfway through 2008.  Shit went downhill fast after that.
Per million miles? Because that's the metric that matters.
Yeah seriously.  These stupid car safety posts are dumb as shit.  Being safe is important but really your changing your overall mortality/injury risk by a tiny fraction of a percent.  Yet people here are acting like a car just outside of modern safety standards is an express ticket to deadsville.  If you care that much about mortality there are many better things you could do to improve your mortality risk.

My 2005 Scion had stability control but no side airbags.   Which was part of my justification to get something newer.
"That‚Äôs one feature I wish my car *didn‚Äôt* have. It‚Äôs a 2010, so it has a fairly early implementation of it, and all it does is cut engine power when it detects wheel slippage, which is incredibly frustrating when you want to launch or just want the car to do what you tell it to do. I frequently find myself turning it off. "
"**Electronic stability control**

Electronic stability control (ESC), also referred to as electronic stability program (ESP) or dynamic stability control (DSC), is a computerized technology that improves a vehicle's stability by detecting and reducing loss of traction (skidding). When ESC detects loss of steering control, it automatically applies the brakes to help ""steer"" the vehicle where the driver intends to go. Braking is automatically applied to wheels individually, such as the outer front wheel to counter oversteer or the inner rear wheel to counter understeer. Some ESC systems also reduce engine power until control is regained.

"Yup, my daily is a 98 328i and has side airbags and ASC (although it is a crappy version, would much rather simply have the LSD)


   Doesn't apply to airbags of course and some other safety features, but one thing to consider with all these electronic stability and traction controls is that it gives drivers a false sense of their actual driving skills.  "

"**Risk compensation**

Risk compensation  is a theory which suggests that people typically adjust their behavior in response to the perceived level of risk, becoming more careful where they sense greater risk and less careful if they feel more protected. Although usually small in comparison to the fundamental benefits of safety interventions, it may result in a lower net benefit than expected.By way of example, it has been observed that motorists drove faster when wearing seatbelts and closer to the vehicle in front when the vehicles were fitted with anti-lock brakes. There is also evidence that the risk compensation phenomenon could explain the failure of condom distribution programs to reverse HIV prevalence and that condoms may foster disinhibition, with people engaging in risky sex both with and without condoms.

By contrast, shared space is a highway design method which consciously aims to increase the level of perceived risk and uncertainty, thereby slowing traffic and reducing the number of and seriousness of injuries.

Yea i said that
"A 2009 is still a nearly 10 year old car and there are plenty of pre-2009 cars that have side air bags. OP is not saying we all need brand new cars. I think it's a great thing to think about. Like OP said a lot of people's first instinct is to get teens a $700 beater car that's 20 years old, without considering that safety features have come a long way since then."
"How is this shilling? Anyone who want to buy cheap is going to get a used car, not one off the lot. I don't think ford or Toyota make any more money off of you if you buy a 2012 used car over a 2005 used car"
"In Norway you easily spend $3700 getting a licence. I sort of doubt that would be feasible in the US. 

But a lot of the side impact problems is because of the studpid layouts in the US. Norway doesn't use stop signs (like we have a few but they are EXTREMELY uncommon, many cities doesn't have a signle one). Stop signs are incredibly dangerous.

Also the US loves stop lights, where we here replace most of them with roundabouts. A roundabout has less crashes and the crashes that do happen is less severe. You can also design roundabouts so drivers gets scared to drive fast in them (lower visibility, high curbs, etc). 

Speed limits are also way lover here. The highest limit here is 60mph. In the city its max 40mph and residential areas are 20mph. Surviving a crash in 40mph is pretty common. If you go past 60mph your odds is drastically reduced."
Yea man I work for Ford lemme tell ya
Sure it does. Side crumple zone is from the exterior panel to the midline of the vehicle.
"Modern cars have side impact beams to prevent intrusion by another vehicle. Not as good as a crumple zone, but better than nothing."
"My husband got really lucky when he was in the passenger seat and basically took a direct hit. The door crumpled inwards [about 12-18 inches](http://i.imgur.com/xTfioKO.jpg) and he walked away with literally one scratch from broken glass. 

Edit: this was a 2002ish Hyundai. "
Christ that‚Äôs sad I wish I hadn‚Äôt read that :(
"The other day I saw some guy driving one of those Oldsmobile from the 70s on the highway, left lane and all. I'm all for vintage cars but man god forbid he got in an accident in that thing, he wouldn't walk away from it."
Poor Lucille 2.
And this is why my dad wouldn‚Äôt let me buy my own car at 16: because the only ones I could afford would‚Äôve been too old for modern safety features. 
"No airbag, entire dash coming back at you, seat flung back about 45¬∞... Huh yeah that'll hurt. "
"After I saw this video a month ago I've told several people about it. It's also the reason I bit the bullet and purchased a more expensive, much more modern (2014) car for my 17 year old son."
"Cars from 1998 didn't have airbags????
"
"How about the [2016 Versa vs 1992 Sentra](https://youtu.be/85OysZ_4lp0)? The ""2015 Tsuru"" in the video is the design of the 1992 Sentra which Nissan continued to sell in Mexico."
"Did you get ticketed? I did a similar thing (could've sworn the approaching vehicle was stopping for the yellow) and I got an improper turn AND reckless driving. Issued to a sobbing twenty year old pulled from a six foot deep canal. Thanks cops.

(But legit thanks to the firemen who heard the crash from their station half a block away and literally ran right over.)"
"I also had a second of deafness and then ears ringing, and during the deaf part my first thought was ‚Äúomg it‚Äôs doing the thing from movies!‚Äù Then all the dust from the airbags made me thing my engine was on fire, but I realized it was just dust quickly. I also had burns on both thumbs from the friction, but I didn‚Äôt realize that until later because they didn‚Äôt hurt right away.

I also had a brief moment of like ‚Äúwhat things are hurt‚Äù and I thought something would be bloody but nothing was. Yay airbags! Honestly the whole thing didn‚Äôt hurt much at all.

Airbags going off in your face really is *an experience*."
"I was actually a little proud of my Civic, cuz I got hit by an SUV, but the SUV looked worse afterwards, lol. The SUVs airbags didn‚Äôt go off because the impact was on their passenger side and no one was sitting there, whereas 3 of mine went off, which is basically what made my car totaled, cuz airbags are expensive to replace. 

But the engine area was hit so I‚Äôm (financially) glad it was totaled. It only had 20k miles on it and I was planning to keep it until it died, so if there were residuals issues after getting repaired, I would‚Äôve had to deal with them for years. 

Emotionally, though, I‚Äôm still sad my poor car got smooshed :("

"It is one of the main reasons I hate driving and have made it my life mission to walk more and live in walkable areas. I‚Äôm actively making it more and more possible for myself to move to a city where having a car is completely optional, in which case I will not have a car at all"
"oof. 
I owned my 2009 Subaru Forester for 2 months when a guy rearended my car going 50mph without using brakes. Totaled. 

I bought a 2011 Volvo XC60. Adore it. "
"Without being there I cant really say, but my gf has been in 2 car-totalling accidents, I was in the car for one. She was so slow to recognize the impending collision I had time to reach over and yank the wheel. Unfortunately I was unable to avoid that accident for her....

My point is, if you really pay attention, learn the 'body language' of bad drivers, you may be able to avoid accidents initiated by other drivers."
[deleted]
My SO is similar! He just got into an accident a few days ago. Not his fault. Someone changed lanes right into him. He had no where to go. Had another where a guy slammed into the back of him on the highway because he was texting and the traffic was stopped. There was another but I'm drawing a blank on what happened. 
"I want an everything camera.  I've been rear ended twice and t-boned once and had a cinderblock fall off a truck and bounce down the highway at 70mph to crush my hood on the way towards my windshield.

Lots of inattentive idiots on the road.  I was rearended in a city while I was stopped at a stop light behind 4 other cars.  How do you not notice 3 lanes of traffic stopped dead for a light?! "
"I haven't driven a car equipped with blind spot detection, but see it on the mirrors of other motorists all the time.


Genuinely curious question, is this really a substitute for extending your mirrors into the correct position and physically looking at blind spots before merging?  I find that I can set up my mirrors to have basically no blind spot but most motorists have them angled tightly backwards so they can't see to the sides.
"
I can't overstate how many times it has saved my ass. I was legit gonna switch lanes and then I hear the dreaded beep and didn't. It happened a lot at the start when I got a longer car but I'm not cognizant of checking blindspot every time. That is 1 feature I can now not buy a car without for sure
"And if you need a computer to assist you braking on ice you should live in Arizona.  And if you need a beeping warning to smack you upside the head and remind you to wear a seatbelt, you deserve the increased injuries.

Given the number of phone users, senior drivers and inattentive drivers on the road I am grateful that more manufacturers are making them standard.  There is no way to get all of the stupid drivers off the road.

The blind spot monitor is looking over my shoulder all the time.  If I signal a lane change, check for traffic and go to merge and some yahoo comes weaving through, it yells at me before we collide.  "
"I never thought I would have a Tesla either. But if you figure out your finances and work hard for something, it's possible. "
Because we want them to still be around for their second car.
Because it's more likely to save your life? Did you even read the op? If you're more likely to get in an accident you need the safer car all the more. 
Are you speaking from experience? 
You're totally right. Financially it is the most logical option. But it's unfortunate when you think about injuries/deaths that could be prevented. 
"Insurance is usually cheaper on old cars, so...?"
"My 2000 has side airbags but not the curtains, if he wants more data points. "
I will further clarify that my side and side curtain are for both front and rear seats. 
RSX? I was about to comment the same 
"No doubt you are haunted every day by the ""What ifs"". What if they had a newer car? What if they took a different route? Drove a different speed? Left at a different time? With the benefit of hindsight, we could probably identify countless decisions that could have altered the events of that day and every day afterwards. 

Realistically, though, we can't possibly know when, where, or how we will meet our fate, so we'd probably end up broke and homeless (which would bring about its own share of risks) if we continually shelled out money trying to eliminate every conceivable risk. 

At the end of the day, all you can do is take the reasonable precautions, most of which have more to do with *how* you drive, rather than *what* you drive. And even if you do everything perfectly, tragedy might strike. ‚òπ I'm sorry for your loss. "
"What benefit? Because After side airbags... The only improvement is autonomous + frontal offset.  


Both are a limited improvement.

And that said a 2016 car is going to be really good. "
I guess people without side impact bags could wear helmets if they're concerned and unable to afford a newer car. 
"I understand that. And all things being equal you will be much safer in a side impact crash than I will be. 

However, plenty of people buy newer cars, and are unwilling or unable to shell out the $$$ when things go wrong. For example, the Airbag failure light typically deactivates all airbags when it detects a problem. Now you have a car with 0 airbags compared to my 2. 

But yeah I agree that Brain damage would change my life for the worse."
">There‚Äôs no price I can put on protecting my brain.

That sounds nice and all, but it's nonsense. No matter what car you happen to have, there is almost certainly a different, more expensive one that would protect your brain better. But you don't even wear a helmet, let alone use [the *real* state-of-the-art safety features](https://auto.howstuffworks.com/auto-racing/nascar/nascar-basics/nascar-safety), because economic trade-offs are part of life and everybody's risk tolerance is greater than zero. "
"> There‚Äôs no price I can put on protecting my brain.

There is indeed; in fact you practically said it yourself. Figure out your average expected annual earnings for the rest of your career, multiply by the number of years left in your career, and boom, there‚Äôs your price. And you can insure for that. "
That‚Äôs a good point. Really I just want *everyone else* to get a new safe car so I can continue driving old fun cars without the safety drawback. Hopefully they‚Äôll all heed posts like these!

Except for all those funerals you went to in high school dad."
Literally survivor bias
If that's not survivor bias I don't know what is. 
I‚Äôm a little confused as to how your two sentences go together? The first one suggests you should buy an older car to save money. The second suggests you should drive the newest car you can afford. ???
"And kids were injured more often because of it, which has led to car seat requirements we have today. Just because you or your friends weren‚Äôt injured doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs a good policy - these societies make these recommendations based on large studies. "
"I will be 36 this year, I had a car seat until I was 5 or 6. I was not in the US, though."
"The stupid thing is, most teens won't wear it even if you've got them. At least that's my experience, maybe teens are more sane in Norway.."
I just bought a high vis vest for my car. Like $6 on amazon. I want some of the LED road flares too maybe. 
"Ikea has the vests for $4, no reason not to grab a few."
"Could be a lot of things. The only feature I know if actually called an anti roll back is for manual cars, also called Hill assist, that keeps the brakes on when you're stopped on a hill to keep from rolling backwards or stalling when you drive off."
"I'm not arguing it's not justified. I'm just saying that the simple 25% statistic is too vague. Statistics can be very misleading. I was looking for more information. 

For example, if 15% of those 25% of fatal accidents would be prevented (I think my math is right) that's only 3.75% of total accidents.

Frugally speaking, that's a negligible number. "
">What's your point exactly? Even if only 50% of those fatal car crashes could've been non-fatal thanks to extra safety precautions it still would've saved thousands of lives.

Thats his point. If its 50% of fatalities prevented that is pretty freaking good.

If its only 1% fatalities prevented that isn't really worth it...right?

We need numbers so we can actually risk stratify. 

Another user sourced its 45% reduction. Which is pretty fucking good and for me definitely worth it. "
"Exactly. 25%? From 50% of angles?

Reminds me of that Dilbert cartoon where they tell the boss that 40% of vacation days are taken on Monday or Friday..."
"95? Passive restraints came in 1991, but my 1994 eagle talon had no airbag but had the stupid auto seatbelts which count as passive restraints."
"What if side impact crashes were 80% of accidents? Then 80% of the incidents account for only 25% of the fatalities. That would make side impact crashes less of a threat than the remaining 20% of crashes that account for 75% of the fatalities. Like I said, any safety is good, but saying that 25% of fatalities come from one specific type of crash doesn‚Äôt tell me anything without more context. "
"I paid $1,500 for my 1995 Ford bronco. I'm almost 40 and I dont think I've ever paid more then $5k for a car. 

But you are right. The thread was talking about 2016+ cars not necessarily brand new cars. 

An extra $5k-$10k is still a lot. "
"I spent $1500 each on my last two cars. So you're still talking 10X my usual budget for your cars.

I'm glad you're able to afford the cars you have, sincerely. But please, let's not pretend that ""affordable"" is the same for one person as it is for another."
"As someone living in Florida, I can see why. So many people here never use their blinker for starters."
Also worth mentioning that US-1 is a pretty main street that runs from Maine to Key West hitting nearly every coastal city along the way.  It takes up a ton of traffic daily.  
Since I live off US1 I should probably get a new car...
There's an awful interchange near my job whose crash rate is 10.97 per million vehicle miles. I see 2 or 3 crashes there per week.
"Why does that metric matter?  Its per person. 

It could take someone from 75 to 100 years of driving to go a million miles. "
Are you sure studies like that controlled for the vast amount of time spent near homes on errands etc.? What about % of accidents that occur at highway speeds vs. neighborhood street speeds (30 mph).
I've seen plenty. Just hating on terrible statistics.
"Front corner I agree with.  


But until self driving cars are fully autonomous, I worry that these additional safety features will cause my driving to become less cautious.  This is an actual problem in multiple fields pre autonomous, its been studied in flying as well. "
"Excellent point; worth checking both factors rather than assuming, as I mistakenly did, because some of the cars that voluntarily had ESC did so before side airbags."
"I wish mine was, the best cars are from the 70s"
You should carry enough insurance either way. Remember that anything beyond the insurance limits you are liable for. 
"Your salesman was full of shit(hardly surprising). The decision to make it mandatory was ANNOUNCED in 2014 but it didn't take effect till this year. Otherwise my 2015 F-150 would be illegal.

"> How is this shilling?

On Reddit, anybody who disagrees with somebody is a paid shill. "
"Sorry if I spoke out of turn, it's just that I've seen several of these types of 'is it really frugal to buy an old car?' posts here over the past few months, and it occurred to me that maybe a motor manufacturer/dealer industry group would add it to their marketing goals to sow some FUD on the cheap. And the 25% / 75% stat is a bit spurious too I think. Anyway, I'm probably way out of line."
"It is very different driving there, you are correct. There are, or at least were*, fewer trucks and SUVs on the roads. One of the other things contributing to these fatal side impact crashes is huge vehicles slamming into smaller ones.

Manual transmissions are only about 3-4% of cars sold in the US. People have lots of love for technology that drives the car for you, but I personally would like to force my friends who text, eat and apply makeup while driving to work a stick shift instead. I think it would be safer, since they can't do both in traffic. 

*I lived in Stockholm in the late 1990s, and visited Norway, Sweden and Denmark frequently in the early 00s.


"
"> Also the US loves stop lights, where we here replace most of them with roundabouts. A roundabout has less crashes and the crashes that do happen is less severe. You can also design roundabouts so drivers gets scared to drive fast in them (lower visibility, high curbs, etc). 

true, i didn't think about how it could be prevented. We love intersections for some damn reason. In my area there are some more roundabouts in the more newly constructed roads. "
"Why, why...you rotten bounder. "
Suddenly I want a spherical car with crumple zones in every possible direction.
*You are the crumple zone*
"Even newer cars also have tiny crumple zones on the side.

The Citroen Cactus even has airbumps. (which won't help *that* much at high-speed collisions but still)"
"i have a mid 2000s volvo that has a crumple zone below the center console. the beams in the door and below the seat direct the force there, which is pretty cool"
"Wow, that's great!"
"Yeah, watching crash test videos of those older cars is terrifying. "
Meanwhile the motorcycle riders of the thread are silently chuckling
"That video is from Australia, many countries required airbags later than the US. In India our cars don‚Äôt even have mandatory airbags right now, they‚Äôre set to become mandatory next year"
"They did in the US, but there are still countries where airbags aren't required to this day.

Not that it would have made much of a difference in that crash test, considering the steering wheel veered off to the side and the whole cabin pretty much collapsed."
yeah I got a failure to yield and i think the other driver got a failure to maintain safe speed. it sucked but I can't argue with it lol. its pretty lame that they'd give you a reckless driving ticket for an improper turn unless you took it on 2 wheela doing 60 lol
[removed]
"Yeah, a little defensive driving goes a long way. Check your mirrors every few seconds so you‚Äôre aware of your surroundings, check your interior mirror when you start slowing down, anticipate what other drivers are going to do (‚Äúthat left lane changed unexpectedly into a turn lane, so it‚Äôs likely this guy doesn‚Äôt want to turn and will re-enter my lane, leave extra space‚Äù), learn common failure points of other drivers and expect them (‚Äúthese two lanes turn left, I‚Äôm in the outside left lane, but there‚Äôs a good chance the guy in the inside left lane won‚Äôt maintain his lane mid-turn, so keep an eye on the mirror‚Äù), and learn good car control and I truly believe most accidents are perfectly avoidable. Certainly in 9 years of driving I haven‚Äôt been in any beyond being bumped twice from behind (no damage) at stoplights. 

EDIT: Whelp, this is ironic. The same day I post this, some guy backs into me while we are waiting to turn at an intersection. I held the horn the whole time, but he ignored it, and I couldn't quite get it in reverse quick enough to avoid. Go figure."
Riding a motorcycle for a little bit made me a better car driver. The safety courses I took and the real danger of 2 ton steel cages speeding around you give you an acute knowledge of the hundreds of dangers on any given roadway. 
The best safety feature is being a good driver and staying the hell away from bad drivers.
You ever thought that maybe she didn‚Äôt react because evasive action wouldn‚Äôt help? Clearly you yanking the wheel didn‚Äôt make a difference. 
"Oh man, I feel so bad for you. Sounds like my worst nightmare. How did you get each case resolved? Did the other party admit fault and insurance covered everything? I bet it was still a major hassle. "
Have you considered never going outside again for the rest of your life?
"Jesus Christ, the cinderblock thing would scare me for life."
"ditto...whole freeway was fully stopped for several minutes. Chevy sedan swerved across 3 lanes and slammed into my car going 50mph.
There was an empty lane to my left that he could have gone into in an emergency.  "
"YMMV. Owner of 2017 Rav4 here. The blind spot detection in this gen‚Äôs Rav4 is fairly useless IMO. It‚Äôs a tiny little light in the mirror. In the daytime, I hardly notice it. If I look hard enough, I take my eyes off the road long enough to possibly rear end somebody.

I did test drive a 17 Impreza with it. Their implementation seemed a lot better with a way more noticeable light."
"I have it in my 2018 Subaru. It‚Äôs helpful. I look before I merge, but sometimes people shoot out after you put the turn signal on and it has caught pedestrians who pop out from between cars parked on city streets. It‚Äôs not like I check my blind spot detector and then go... I physically look, signal, then move. But it‚Äôs a fail safe... kinda like my back up camera. "
"I rented a 2018 Mazda CX-5 for a week that seemed to have every possible option, including: blind spot detection, distance sensing cruise control that can brake to a stop, automatic emergency braking, rear cross traffic detection, lane departure warning, and lane keeping assist.  I‚Äôd never previously driven a vehicle with any of these features.

The blind spot system was pretty good.  Large-ish yellow indicator in the mirror that I could see peripherally somewhat.  Loud beep if I turned on the turn signals with a vehicle in the blind spot.

Side mirrors cannot see into your blind spot (except for some vehicles with two-angle mirrors or adding a stick-on blind spot mirror).  I also had blocked out the rear passenger window to shield my baby from the sun.  I had a tiny third window to peak through.  With 20+ hours in that car, I came to trust the blind spot system.  As long as you drive defensively and keep situational awareness up, this particular blind spot system can be relied on."
"They are technically called, side-rear view mirrors, and should be angled so you can see behind you out of them. If a driver takes the time, they can find the correct angle where they minimize the blind-spots as well. However, some cars have much larger blind-spots than others based on the size and placement of the B,C and D pillars."
You should probably check your blind spots every time too...
"> There is no way to get all of the stupid drivers off the road.

Increased enforcement. I used to live in Virginia where you were sent to jail for driving poorly. Not an exaggeration. 20 mph over the limit or anything else that could constitute ""reckless driving"" and you were locked up for the night. Extreme? Sure. I don't entirely miss it. But damn if our drivers didn't behave.

Meanwhile, everyone should be taught to drive defensively. You should always make every maneuver on the road with the assumption that literally every other vehicle operator around you is an idiot who will do something stupid. If you're not capable of doing that, just don't drive. I'll welcome the lesser traffic."
"If teens and other young people were taught to be better drivers they wouldn't need that second car, they'd still have that first one"
"Not to mention the cost of medical care if you get seriously injured in an old car. That $25000 cost for a safe care is a good insurance policy imo, especially considering that 25k will be gone in a heartbeat if you need any form of advanced surgery..."
"I messed up my first car- granted I wasn't in a serious accident & no one was hurt but it was still bad enough that I had to get a new car. And no, not having a fancy car with fancy safety features would've prevented this accident."
"To a point, yes, old passenger cars will get down to crazy low rates after a while.  But we didn't drive those.  My car is essentially a 200 hp go-kart with about as many safety features as well and a curb weight to match.

  If I get into a shoving match with an SUV, it's not the cost of the car that my insurance is concerned about, it's how long my hospital stay is going to be.

Far as insurance is concerned, cars are the cheap part to fix."
Improvements in car safety do actually save lives though...
I sleep in a helmet. #CranialSafety4Life.
"I don‚Äôt want an insurance payout, I want a functioning brain and the ability to enjoy my life.

I swear to god, this fucking sub sometimes. Ya‚Äôll got poverty PTSD or something."
The same thing happened to me too! It really felt like they came out of nowhere! I was mortified.
"Haha exactly! But I don‚Äôt know if you could even use that defence because I‚Äôm pretty sure fewer people died in car accidents back in the day because there was less traffic, fewer hazards and I think most towns used to be more walkable so people didn‚Äôt have to do as much driving."
Sigh. Drive whatever car you want. Learning from other people‚Äôs misfortune is not just survivor bias. By that logic everyone would have to see what having cancer is like before learning not to expose themselves to carcinogens... but you do you bro.
"Buy the newest car you can afford, but don't over extend yourself. 

I am trying to get across that you shouldn't buy an older car if you can afford something newer. "
"Never said it was a bad idea, just pointing out how things change."
"Really? I've seen all sorts of reckless teens in the US, but never seen anyone not wear a seatbelt.

However, in my home country of Russia, so many men eschew seatbelts and if you put one on, they act offended, as if you don't trust their driving. To be fair, people who drive in Russia are god-level in driving skill, I don't even understand how they drive when I watch them, but still, shit still happens. "
"That‚Äôs the one, hill assist! Cheers"
"There‚Äôs also the point that you can be injured without dying, and if those injuries are reduced due to airbags, that saves time and suffering and money.

Also, for what it‚Äôs worth, the [IIHS estimates SABs reduce deaths in side collisions by 45%](http://www.iihs.org/iihs/sr/statusreport/article/38/8/1) ."
4% seems high. I'll easily shell out extra cash for a 4% safety boost. Being frugal is not about cheaping out and sacrificing. It's about living financially efficient. 
Well good thing you wont have to be frugal when you're dead. 
TBF I am more worried about being injured for life than to die. Imagine waking up with pain for every day for the rest of your life. Knowing that maybe it could have been prevented.
"Lol yeah, I didn't read it correctly, it was quite late and glanced over the ""I don't ask this because I doubt the effectiveness of the airbags"" part somehow."
"Per crash, but if they're 4 times more likely to happen than any other accident, then we're right back to where we started.

And, in fact, we are. Regardless of the spread of crashes."
"Oh totally! I know 16k is still a huuuuuge amount for a lot of people. But I spent that on a 2017 with 17 thousand miles, so I gotta think that there are plenty of post2009 cars out there for prices that are reachable for most people. 

I‚Äôve had 30 dollars to my name before. I get it and it sucks. Sometimes the only frugal option is something with wheels that moves. But there‚Äôs an argument to be made that it‚Äôs more frugal to spend an extra couple hundred dollars for peace of mind, assuming you‚Äôre able to, which is I think what OP was getting at. 

But that probably gets back to the main problem of this sub, which is frugality for its own sake vs frugality because you have to be."
Because that's how we measure driving deaths. 2008 had less driving due to high gas costs.
"Sure, if you like really slow cars.
Modern grocery getters are faster than 70s sports cars."
"Yeah, but a cheaper/older car you can often afford to pay for any damage it incurs, or you just may not care at all. No sense paying extra as you would when your car is someone else's ""investment."""
"Even the sedans are smaller here. But the size of the car doesn't matter if the roads makes the accidents not happen or at greatly reduced speeds.

Lucikly we are moving away from manual at a fast pace. Hybrids and electric cars have a huge market share, and they are never manual. People also want automatic now.

There is no problem doing several things while driving a manual. Use a too low gear and ignore the wear on the clutch (you can easily drive stop and go traffic in second for instance). At high speeds you rarely change gears. I think automatic stopping for cars and pedestrians is a far more important solution, although it wont stop people from going into ditches (although cars that read lines and vibrate the wheel and make noise when you are off course could help). 

What I don't understand is why people would want a 90's corolla with an automatic transmission. Its slow, changes gears at unfortunate times and is more jerky than manual changes. Old cheap cars seems to have terrible automatics. But for a modern car Id go automatic all the way. I want both hands on the wheel and no distractions from steering (altho I drive a manual now, I have to because I teach people to drive).

I am also perplexed by the lack of pedestrian safety in the US. Here we were reflective clothes or high vis vests while walking around. In the US I saw people jogging with only tiny tiny reflective bits on their shoes. I would have been wearing a vest, and possibly some led light."

"Or youre my idiot father in law who thinks cars should be made out of steel ibeams. I asked him what he thought would happen to the occupants if the car came to a sudden stop/didn't crumple? He made some comparison to hitting a pole at 5 mph and needing to replace the entire bumper on these cheap ""plastic"" cars."
You might as well be in a bike at that point.
Volvo for the win.
"Crash test videos are setup for the worst possible situation. You going 60 mph crashing head on directly into someone else going 60 mph. No one reacting like real life. Those tests aren't meant to show real life accidents where most likely you will be going up 20mph, slowing down and turning out of the accident when it happens. "

Well, I presume that daytime city driving speeds are too slow to main anyone :-/ Highways though, that's another story"

"I don't think enough people realize this. I've been in many close calls, but no accidents. Mostly because I've been lucky, but also because I pay attention to the people around me, and expect them to do stupid things. You can usually tell when someone is about to cut you off or slam on their brakes, sometimes before they even realize it. "
"Also leave a good distance between your car and the one in front of you. I don't understand people who insist on driving almost bumper to bumper in traffic yet alone on the highway. I usually keep a good two car lengths behind in traffic, and much more when driving the limit on the highway. 

Maintaining a safe distance gives you a LOT more time to react to unexpected braking, changed road conditions, etc. "
"My maneuver definitely pushed the point of impact further down the side of the vehicle, doing it sooner coupled with slamming the accelerator might have fully avoided the collision. 

We did talk about it, she said she didn't think they were going to run into us. The situation was kinda a tough one, we were both making left turns to go opposite directions on the same road. The other driver didn't see us at all because they were so hyper focused on the cross traffic, I believe my gf was similarly focused on cross traffic and failed to recognize the collision course of the other vehicle."

Also ask others not to come inside while you‚Äôre at it. 
"Where's the protective bubbles on Amazon?  I need one to live in.

Worst part was, apart from the cinderblock, defensive driving on my part wouldn't have helped.  One ran into me at a stoplight with a half dozen cars stopped, one popped up over a hill and t-boned me at an intersection because they ""didn't think anyone would be on the road at midnight"" and one hit me because he was in his 80's and distracted by pain on his way to the dentist."
"I do not drive behind trucks without multiple cars between me and them now.  Worst part was I was in heavy traffic, couldn't swerve to the side to avoid it or do more than tap on the brakes so it hit the hood and bounced instead of going through the windshield.  Cut a 5 inch gash in the hood under the dent."
You can't teach experience
"A good education never hurt anyone that‚Äôs for sure but I would say it takes about 5 years of driving every day to actually get properly good at it. Until then they‚Äôre still inexperienced. There‚Äôs a good chance a new driver hasn‚Äôt encountered some of the more rare things for their area. Multi lane roundabouts, power outage on a traffic light, turning left onto a one way street, icy road conditions, narrow winding dirt roads with blind corners, sharing the road with motorcycles, semi trucks, bikes, horses, farm vehicles, other drivers doing unpredictable things. The only way anyone can get good at this stuff is to keep doing it. Might as well be safe about it. "
"You paid attention in Driver's Education when you were a kid? When I was 15 taking the after school class it was simply a check mark so I could get my license and my freedom...I didn't get very much out of it. You can't realistically expect fifteen-year-olds to garnish a ton of life lessons in a classroom. You learn experience by being out on the road not in a class. Would you want a doctor performing a surgery on you that only had a classroom education, or a doctor that had a classroom education and lots of practice on cadavers and then living people? Probably the later, why, because we all know that real life experience trumps classroom education. "
So they should have one car for life?
"I've never even considered this. Even my fairly simple, outpatient knee surgery was 25k before insurance kicked in. With insurance still paid 5k. Can't imagine a bad car wreck. Well into 25k territory with decent insurance."
"OP‚Äôs point wasn‚Äôt talking about safety features that prevent accidents.  We are talking about safety features that help you survive accidents, and if anyone needs those features, it is inexperienced drivers."
You won't prevent accidents with safe cars.  You will save lives in inevitable accidents.
"That's not the point. The fancy car saves lives, it doesn't totally a avoid accidents."
"Sports cars are always expensive to insure, mostly due to the types of driving they encourage and the types who buy them. 

Your car insurance doesn't pay for your hospital stays in most states, so that's irrelevant to the cost. The at-fault driver pays, and if that's you, your health insurance pays[edit: for your injuries; your auto insurance pays for the injuries of others]."
"No doubt. It always comes down to the cost/benefit analysis, though. 

Would you agree to pay $5000 per month for the rest of your life for a 1% increase in safety? Not unless you happened to be filthy rich. $500/mo for a 5% increase in safety? Probably not, but maybe. $100/mo for a 10% increase? Quite possibly. $10/mo for a 20% increase? Absolutely. "
"Well, at least you're not hypocritical about your nonsense. I admire your integrity."
"Cut him some slack, he might be an actuary."
"Thing is though, you can never predict how and when you will get into an accident, auto or otherwise. You could always walk around in a helmet and never take it off. You could never leave your hometown because it's safer not to travel at all. You could only buy $50,000 luxury sedans that always come with the top notch safety features, so in 2018 that's automatic computer-guided braking when detecting a threat. 


However, the vast majority of people don't undertake these steps. There is a line you draw on both sides, being too frugal or being too safe. Let's not swing into the other direction. Plus, it's not like having side airbags is guaranteed to save your brains. You could still need that insurance even in a safe car, it's all about what you hit and at what speed you hit it (or the speed that it is also moving). "
"I was just (somewhat obtusely) basing that price off of what *you* said-- no brain, no career, implying that you valued your brain equivalently to your earning potential. In reality I'm not surprised you value your brain at more than just your career :)"
"Per 100,000 people, traffic deaths have decreased consistently since the 70's."
"Thanks for sharing a statistic, that's all I was asking for. "
"I worked in a trauma icu before going back to grad school.

Let me tell you death is a better option than the injuries these people ""live"" with"
"Yes, there's potential added protection by Side Air Bags against things such as traumatic brain injury."
"I'd argue that being frugal does, however, mean finding out the numbers and thinking about them critically rather than just hand-waving it. "
"I guess to be fair, there isn‚Äôt rent payments on a coffin and you don‚Äôt have to pay the up front cost."
"I'm fine with everybody doing their own thing.

If one wants to be frugal in one way just to splurge in another, ok.

If one wants to be frugal just to see all the savings, that's ok too.

If one is frugal out of necessity, bless you.

Or any other reason. I don't care. What I don't like in this sub is when people tell other that they are being frugal wrong. I get the inclination though; I sometimes want to say ""really?"", but try to hold my tongue. We're all subbed here because we are trying to be frugal in a way that works for us."
Speed doesn't really matter when it looks like [this](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/3a/62/a4/3a62a4b4a4f4824848fcef82f43b2927.jpg)
"Insurance costs aren't primarily based on the value of your own car.
The real concerns are medical costs and damage to property other than your own.

If you rear end a $100,000 car and cause the driver to require $250,000 worth of medical treatment the fact that you drive a $1500 beater doesn't enter into it. You will end up with wage garnishment if you lack sufficient coverage."
Is that a real thing?
"In my day we didn't have ""crumple zones"", or seat belts!  And we didn't need no nanny state telling us to put our kids in car seats, they just sat on our laps!  We all survived just *fine*!!

Have you shown him the videos of a modern car and an older car crashing into each other like this one? [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joMK1WZjP7g](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joMK1WZjP7g)
"Cars can have both crumple zones for high energy collisions, and 5-mph bumpers for that low energy everyday ""oops""."
"True, but worst case scenarios do happen. I'd rather be in a modern vehicle with crumple zones in any accident than in a big boat from the 70s. "
yea last week i got lucky. thinking the car next to me might move over i pulled back right before they swerved into my lane. i was in their blind spot the whole time and they definitely didn‚Äôt look
"I try to do this and it's fine in the suburbs where I live, but in the city people just see it as a space to merge into your lane. Then you back off them and someone else does it again. It's crazy driving. "
This is the exact reason I gave up my fun little VW Rabbit when I had my son... The back seat is the crumple zone :(
"Wow, medical care is insanely expensive. In many ways people fail to remember that it's not just the cost of the surgery...my friend was in the hospital for 6 months. That's six months without work, six months of paying the hospital, etc. luckily it was paid for since we are under the military's medical care...but for the average person that could wreck all your savings or plumet the person into severe debt. 

Also the cost estimate of 25k for a car after 2009 is a little extreme. That's what you would pay for a nice new car that's one year old with minimal miles. "
"> Your car insurance doesn't pay for your hospital stays in most states, so that's irrelevant to the cost. The at-fault driver pays, and if that's you, your health insurance pays.

If you're at fault, you can bet the other party's health insurance is going to come after your auto insurance company for the costs. Totaling the $30k car is nothing compared to the $200k hospital bill. Also why you shouldn't cheap out on your coverage amount - they'll get what they can from your insurance, and then come after you for the rest."
"Important to note though, it's not as though that sort of $X extra for Y% safety increase is even a cost-benefit analysis most of us are even capable of assessing or incorporating!


Most people don't have a grasp of what safety ratings *mean*. A typical four star rated car in a particular type of crash has a **200% to 300%** over a typical five star rated car of causing serious injury or death! Yet how many people are walking around with the impression that a four-star rated car is pretty adequate and five stars is just a bit better!


The other crazy thing then is the fact that people typically don't consider risk of a fatality in assessing *other* costs in their life beyond vehicle prices. Choosing to live out in the suburbs and then drive into the city for work could easily require me to drive five to ten times more, often at highway speeds, than living in a city without a car, or just using a car for a very short commute or errands. Yet this hundred to thousand percent increase in the risk of dying in a car accident is typically ignored when deciding the costs of where to live!"
Well that‚Äôs good news! I‚Äôm happy that all of my assumptions are wrong haha I‚Äôve never heard my parents talk about people they knew getting in car accidents. My dad is in his early 70s and would definitely remember the days of minimal safety standards.

Safer cars CAN be cheaper to insure because they're less likely to injure others. "

That's one reason some highways feel so unreasonably slow now. 55mph on non belted, skinny tires with manual steering, shitty suspension and a car that will put your steering wheel through your chest in an accident is waaaay more terrifying than in a modern car with traction control, ABS, side curtain airbags and crumple zones. Modern tires help a ton too. Tire tech has improved a ridiculous amount just in the last 10 years."

"I work at home depot (currently on my 2 weeks before my new job)

The turnover for cashiers are crazy high, new people every week kind of high. So don't go giving them grief if they don't immediately understand what youre asking. it's very likely the first time they have had someone ask about the price match. 

They have a $50 price point that they can use before manager approval but don't expect them to give it to you just because you want it. 

If you're going to try to get a veterans discount you need very specific cards for it. 

There's a stupidly good return policy for 90 days. People buy shit and return it muddy and clearly used all the time for a full refund. Basically a home depot lending program.

All that said these are the rules the cashiers are stuck with. In many cases the managment will totally disregard the rules and make the cashiers look like they don't know what they are talking about by siding with the customers, giving them preferential treatment. 


I don't work the front end this is just how the rest of us hear about it. "
"Thanks for sharing. I've run into weird situations like that also. I had one Walmart grocery store that refused to accept free coupons (not printed out, mailed from the manufacturer). I finally gave up and used them somewhere else. I wish there was a sticky somewhere (even on a different sub if needed) that would have a list of store coupon & price matching policies for the big chains. "
A manager at home depot gave me a huge attitude when I was trying to get a table saw price matched and 10% off. For some reason they take it personally when the company policy allows it.
Home Depot employees can also give discounts if you ask. I think they are allowed to do up to $50 without manager approval. 
Try out Harbor Freight Tools if you can't find something at the Home Depot. It's the second place I go for tools..
"One time I bought a light fixture and broke the cover to the light bulb. I was on the ladder. 

I went to the store and asked if they sold just the cover. It was a pretty standard looking cover. They ended up replacing the whole fixture. "
"As a former HD Cashier... (I last worked there in 2006) unless policy has changed those employees were wrong. HD will match and beat a competitor by 10% - as long as that competitor is on our list, it should be done."
Same thing happened to me. Tried to get them to price match something from Lowe's. Was told b&m don't price match online prices and if I wanted to price match in-store I would have to bring in a physical ad... Told them that if I had to go to Lowe's to get proof I might as well buy the item while I was there. They finally gave me me the price match and rung me up but I realized they didn't give me the extra 10% so I called them out on it. They had to call up the manager again get approval and rung me up again. Took 10 minutes and a queue built up behind me but I was finally able to get them to honor their price match guarantee
"We live where there is a Home Depot and Menards, which is more of a midwest thing.  Menards often runs an 11% mail in rebate on your purchase.  Home depot will match it aith a gift card if Menards is currently offering it.

The cashier didn‚Äôt give me a hard time at all, I got the price match + 10% (well I got the price match easy and reminded them about the 10%. There was literally a sign advertising it behind the employee I was working with). I had it brought up on my phone in the Lowe‚Äôs website but wasn‚Äôt asked for any proof. "
Lowes price matches too.
"> There's a stupidly good return policy for 90 days. People buy shit and return it muddy and clearly used all the time for a full refund. Basically a home depot lending program.

I will say that this relaxed return policy has helped me, not gaming the system.  I bought ~$40 in pipe fittings for a project.  Lost the reciept, never did the project.  I went to a different home depot months afterwards and they refunded it back onto my card, even though I said I would accept a store credit.  I wasn't even expecting them to take them back."
"I was a cashier and head cashier back in 1999/2000. The return policy was even crazier then- we‚Äôd accept anything at any time for any reason. People would return things from other stores (as in still had an ACE sticker or whatever) and we‚Äôd have to take it. If we didn‚Äôt carry it (you know, since certain brands we didn‚Äôt carry), we‚Äôd have to give them a refund of like product. 

It actually  was a pretty good job. Made $10/hr part time while in school when minimum wage was probably $5-6. Plus it was generally a fun place to work. "
"> The turnover for cashiers are crazy high, new people every week kind of high.

Exactly this. As a customer, I sense that it's rare to find an employee with any experience at Home Depot. I don't know any other store with turnover like this. Unless you find the one old guy who has been working at the store for 40 years, nobody knows where anything is."

"I've gotten discounts on obviously opened items before, the employee just wrote on the packaging and initialed it"
"That's not how it works. If you come up to an employee asking for a ""discount"" they'll say no. That's because it isn't a discount, it's an official markdown that the employees are recorded for. Something along the line needs to happen for that kind of compensation to be justifiable. Just be nice to the employees and pay the price. Don't be that guy."
"I used to work there. I can confirm that. If youre a nice customer, I'd return the favor."
"Depends honestly. I‚Äôm a commercial electrician for work, and won‚Äôt buy work tools their, because the quality and durability isn‚Äôt the same as name brand stuff, especially when it comes to power tools and cutters... Milwaukee for power tools and Klein for hand tools is my go to. 

But if I know I‚Äôll only use it a few times... HF all the way. "
"HF is fantastic if you don't mind stopping in the middle of a project to run and replace a tool. Most everything I've bought from there is still around from the first time I purchased it, but I've had more than a few tools snap during normal use. Just know that going there has inherent risk of part failure. Be safe and plan accordingly."
"I have used them for tools I think I will only use once or twice around the house.  Tools are one thing I will usually spend a little more on though since I have been fixing up this house and plan on doing another, so long run worth it for me.  With this particular purchase it was for a bare tool DeWalt battery powered vacuum.  So I was limited to the batteries that I have.  "
HF is the first place I go.
"I‚Äôm the future, just buy a new one, take the piece you need, and put the broken piece in the box with the rest, and then return it and say it came like that. Unethical? Maybe. But they can see that it‚Äôs broken and do what they need to do to have it fixed/replaced"
Wal-Mart refused to honor a price match on milk because the milk at the other store wasn't the same brand. Well no shit. Why would another store sell Wal-Mart brand milk?
Because I didn't want to wait for it. Wasn't from Amazon so it didn't have two day shipping. I like instant gratification. 
"This is what the policy is meant for! You used it exactly as it is intended, as a great service offered to DIY customers.

They bank on the fact that you know it's easy to return things, to encourage you to buy in excess and then essentially hope you forget or not find it worth it to return a few fittings."
It sounds like they were able to find your credit card in their  system and pulled up the receipt in order for you to get a refund back on your card otherwise no receipt usually means store credit only
"I recently returned a plant that died because I didn't water it. Granted, it died much quicker than it should have (a matter of days or what is usually a low-maintenance plant) but still, I felt very silly about it and was amazed they let me return it."

"When you do that, the person who oversees the self checkout week have to come over and scan the coupons. 110% of the time, they'll find issue with them. They act like the money is coming out of their own pocket. "
"My Walmart doesn't allow coupons at the self checkout. I kind of understand because almost every time one or more of the coupons wouldn't work and then they had to retrieve the coupons, and in order to do that they had to get a salaried manager to open up the machine. Which naturally took forever. "
Is that deal still going on lol.
Yeah I wasn‚Äôt suggesting that people randomly ask for discounts for no reason. We bought some appliances so I asked just because we were spending so much. 
"They are hobby tools. When I was an iron worker  if you brought that crap on the job site you would be asked to stop using them.

Correct. I am an idiot. That doesn't mean that the material is good quality though.
"Nah, commercial electric work. Like new builds, the actual electrical like outlets and lighting. Done a few Starbucks, some dialysis centers, stuff like that. We also do some residential stuff but more commercial. We don‚Äôt do too much with data (internet/cable) but we do it here and there. 

We‚Äôre currently doing our third dialysis center, 8000 square foot, new build. Job consists of running conduits both underground and overhead, roughing in and finishing boxes for both outlets and lighting, building the whole panel setup (5 total)"

"Last year, they had generic robotussin cough gel tablets, 15 x 15mg for $1. If they restock it this flu season I highly recommend buying some up. The same off-brand is $3 on amazon. brand name at walmart is ~$6 for 20 tablets. generic tablets are rarely available in pharmacies I've been to. Got some strange looks when buying 5 boxes of cough medicine..."
The package sizes are usually way smaller
It's not always the same product- the concentration levels can be different.
"There can be differences.  It could be made in a different country where the active ingredients are different than what you normally find at WM and Target.  They could be items at or near expiration, so you're not getting good value if you are buying a 100 pack if Tylenol for example that expires next week and you only use it once a month.  What you find at the Dollar Tree for cheaper is probably not the same thing.  Beware."
"There stuff really isn‚Äôt a better bargain, it‚Äôs just smaller packaging and very low quality stuff. "
"I have come to really like this store over the last few years.  You kind of learn as time goes on which items are more durable and which ones might break right after you walk out the door, but overall I think you are able to stretch your dollars out by buying some items from dollar tree.  

Right now I am getting some of my children's school supplies from dollar tree and I am impressed with what can be had in this section of the store.  Some things, like the plastic pencil pouches, dont seem likely that they will hold up very long but things like the binders, notebooks, pencils, index cards, folders, etc all seem just as good as the name brands (and some items actually are the name brands.)  But here too, you need to be a sharp shopper cause why pay $1 for a one subject spiral notebook when you can get one for a quarter right now at walmart.  It's the opposite though if you are getting a 3 subject notebook, for that the better deal may be dollar tree.  

Shopping at dollar tree is frugal, but it's always good to know your prices (compare with other stores) and recognizing if the quality of the item will suit your needs."
you are not frugal 
"I stock up when I see brand name cold medicine there. A few times I've seen stuff that looked like new products, not sure if they didn't sell well in other stores or what. It was brand name stuff that would have been $5 or more at Walmart. I can't remember the name on all of them but one of them was a Mucinex cold medicine, full size box for $1. I find it handy to have cold medicine just in case so that if we get sick we don't have to go to the store while sick."
"yep. i stopped in to get some cheap foil for a project that i didn't want to use my good stuff for. They had reynolds wrap brand, but the box was quite small (I'm not sure it was even 25 ft) and the box art was sort of vaguely off. It wasn't as bright as it is at a grocery stores, actually. "
Spoken like someone who never shops at Dollar Tree.  Nothing is near the expiration date.  OTC drugs are the same strength and quality as you get anywhere else.  The only difference is the price.
"Actually there's some really good gems at Dollar Tree. For example, they sell 16oz cold Coke products for a buck; you'd pay 1.85 at the cheapest for a 18oz bottle anywhere else. And there's ton of examples like that."
"vitamins, too. they have Vitamin C tablets, but not for those who don't like swallowing pills. "
Stock up while you can. Name brand stuff is usually closeouts. 
Take my lunch to work on a regular basis.  I see so many people eating out at my office.  Easy to spend $10-15 a day going out compared to $2-3.   I figure I save a couple hundred a month.   I only eat out 1 or 2 times a month as a treat.  
"Using those refillable K-Cups for a Keurig. I bought one off of my friend after he didn't need it anymore and those cups can cost almost as much as getting a cup of coffee from the gas station!

"#Exercise
I do cardio (running, biking, if I'm near a trail then hiking) for at least 30 minutes every day.

#Healthy Diet
I eat a 80% plant-based/20% animal based diet version of the Blue Zone diet (which is 95% plant based, 5% animal based).
https://www.bluezones.com/recipes/food-guidelines/
Organic food only. Animal protein is sourced from organic, wild caught, pasture-raised, and/or grass-fed only.

#Hydration
Drink water frequently (at least 16 fluid oz, 4 times per day should be sufficient for most people) to support cognitive function, muscle building, skin health, and frequent excretion of bodily waste matter.

#Sleep
Get 7-9 hours of quality sleep. You'd be surprised how much a good night's rest can influence your day in the good way.

Buying all organic food may be more expensive now, but, if you look at the bigger picture, doing all of this will save you A LOT of money over the course of your entire life:
no outrageous hospital bills, no to many medications to ingest/inject for lifetime, no to many chronic diseases (heart disease, Alzheimer's disease, cancer, diabetes), and yes to a healthier, happier life to enjoy with your loved ones.

And a million times better for the environment :) 
My husband uses one of those at work.  I bought him a 300 pack of paper liners for  $10 for and he said it makes them much easier to clean them out and also less likely to give him ground in his coffee.

Instead treat yourself to the nice stuff on the menu. I try to limit myself to one day of eating out. I sometimes even treat myself to the bacon cheese Whopper. It's not frugal but it's worth it to me.

"You have no idea how much socializing you're missing out on.

* Lunch is a situation of captive socializing, people have to drive/walk to a place, sit down, wait for food, and eat; while they are doing that, they might as well converse; no one has to sit around in a break room to have coffee, they can have their coffee back at their desk while working.
* People share things once at lunch and forget who they hadn't told; I once found out my best work friend was having a 3rd kid 5 months after everyone else because I was on travel when he told people at lunch.
* If you are not getting inside work jokes/memes, then they probably originated during a lunch conversation.
* Not that it happens a lot, but when you are not present during a social ""event"", it presents the opportunity for co-workers to gossip/trashtalk about you without an opportunity for you to defend yourself."
That was my point. 
"Huh, that is complete news to me! I was always under the impression that you should never wash a cat unless its visibly dirty! I have also never smelled a cat (only their litter boxes)! :)"
"Socializing is nice and all, but I'm not paying 15 bucks a day 5 days a week for it.

That's 75 dollars. It's my food budget for the entire *month*.

There's no reason you can't all eat prepared meals together and converse during that time. For increased bonding, you can even plan meals so different people come with different things and share."
"What if you do not like making small talk with, and listening to, people you don't necessarily enjoy the company of? Then it becomes a waste of time, energy and money"
I use to go out all the time.  Only thing I am missing is gossip and complaining.  I have better opportunities to develop friendships and catch up with people during free time throughout the work day.  
"I don't see why not. Water is generally quite harmless.

My mother has a cat and never washes it. It smells a lot, but she simply doesn't notice since she lives with it."
"This. About once a month my coworkers make a big deal out of going out for dinner and drinks. There is only a couple of them I actually enjoy the company of. The rest are snobby, annoying, and just plain dumb. I would rather not spend my time/energy/money to be around them unnecessarily. If they want to trash talk me, by all means go ahead. I have more important things to do than care about what those people think of me (my job is just to give me some income while I am in college). "
Very interesting. My cat has maybe been bathed twice in its life!
"If it doesn't smell too much or isn't bothering anyone, that's totally fine. Cats don't naturally use water to clean themselves."
Could you make one yourself? There are some great tutorials on YouTube and Pinterest - as you say most of them are just glue and cardboard anyway so you probably have the components yourself already!

A bit of carpet wrapped around a wood post used to keep mine happy. I staple-gunned the carpet onto it and screwed it to a flat base.

"chewy.com  or look for them on clearance at pet smart, and buy ones where you can flip them over."
"That sounds about what I pay since shipping is free. I figure that they have to offset that expense plus the % that goes to Amazon. I've tried to make my own with carpet remnants and such. The cats will use them sometimes, but they much prefer to use the wavy cardboard ones."

"Two unlimited lines at T-mo should be $120 with free Netflix and you can sign up to get $10 off per line if you use less then 2GB in a month for free. 

You might be paying on phones which is why it‚Äôs more."
Cricket has an international plan (I use it when I travel to Mexico frequently). I would suggest it. 
Financing the phones aren't a huge issue. It comes out to the same price. Very few occasions do you save money. Most of it is 0% and just paid over the length of a contract. I'd rather keep the money in pocket and pay it monthly since there's no interest. We can buyout at any time with cash if need be.
"They also have an option to get 10gb of high speed internet a month after that you get 3g speeds, but  also no netflix. $40 a line. I pay $80/month for two lines "
They only have it for North America. Not Europe/Asia.  Sorry I should have specified  
"I‚Äôm a sales manager at a car dealership. Your best bet is to narrow down what car(s) you want and start off online. Search cargurus, autotrader etc to narrow down *what* car dealership to go to or to call as sometimes the deal is so good you‚Äôll consider having the car shipped to you. 

Rule #1 is to fact check everything a salesman says. It is absolutely not true that there generally isn‚Äôt more than a $100 discount available. Now if you‚Äôve searched online for the exact same car throughout your state and you see that the dealership you‚Äôre speaking to has the lowest price then definitely there‚Äôs not a lot of room to negotiate but if you‚Äôre at a dealer where the price of their car is thousands more than everyone else then obviously there is room. 

If you plan on financing definitely go through your own bank first to fact check the dealers APR as they make money by giving you a higher APR. 

DO NOT get from a buy here pay here.

DO NOT buy from off lease only "
"Buying used I'd recommend getting one from a private seller as this is a car dealership's biggest profit margin, other than selling extended warranties. 

No matter what take it to a certified mechanic you trust to inspect the vehicle, dealers do the bare minimum inspection. Most dealers include warranties with used cars but it's usually short, between 30 days and 6 months. Not really useful because if something breaks within that short time frame it's very likely other things will go wrong after that."
"i am doing my payments through my bank instead of the dealership because it's a lot less expensive when it comes to interest, so that's a good tip. i assume that applies to all regions of the country. "
"Fwiw I got my car (2013 BMW) for $1000 less than listed. It was around $30k though. You can get a quote for a loan through a bank and then compare that to the loan the dealer can give you. Just be sure the loan comes with GAP coverage, which means the bank will pay off your loan in the event of a total loss of the car, say if you're in an accidental. That way you're not stuck paying the remaining balance on something you cannot use. State Farm includes this, for example."
"Frugal: Save up money, buy used, pay cash."
"> DO NOT buy from off lease only

I'm a dumb. Can anyone explain what this means?
I shouldn't buy a car that was previously leased? I shouldn't lease a car then end up buying the leased car? Huh"
This.  They are charging minimum $500 processing fees now.  Some are in the $800 range.  If you finance you are paying interest on a $500 and hour one time over X years/months.  
"Strongly seconding buying from a private seller. Especially on the lower end of the price spectrum. Dealers have to turn enough profit to justify keeping a unit on their lot and pay for their time and bills and are going to mark things up enough to make a profit.


A lot of private sellers are just in the process of buying a new car, have gotten a low-ball ""trade-in"" offer and just want to do better than that. They don't care about turning X profit or whatever, they just want to come out a thousand or so ahead and not have to deal with the headache of garaging/storing another vehicle."
you get a downvote for advocating for gap insurance after a car has depreciated a lot of its value.

Guaranteed Auto Protection (GAP) insurance (also known as GAPS) was established in the North American financial industry. GAP insurance is the difference between the actual cash value of a vehicle and the balance still owed on the financing (car loan, lease, etc.).[1] GAP coverage is mainly used on new and used small vehicles (cars and trucks) and heavy trucks. Some financing companies and lease contracts require it.[2]

~~If you buy a used Car A. lets pretend its from 2008 and was valued at 20000. and you get a loan for it at 8-10k.~~  Lets also assume the used car price you bought it for is the cash value price.  No downpayment. In this scenario (most used car sales) the price you buy the car at is the cash value price so the gap spread is small."
"Pft. I buy bread at 3 days past and eat it for a week after. That's frugal, and not being wasteful. That's not cheap. Bread does not turn bad on a date. It's just not as fresh. I like toast, so even a little dry is fine. If it's not moldy, it's fine. "
"If it's not moldy, it's fine. Bread let's you know when it's bad. Also natures own honeywheat seems to have a magical ability to *never* go moldy. I think I had some for 3 months once. It's insane (I think it's the honey)

Expired milk however can go to hell. Not worth that first sip of gross ass sour milk. 

Then again I can't drink milk anymore (fuck you body)"
"‚ÄúNo green, it‚Äôs keen. ‚Äú"
"Bread confuses me so much, I can buy a loaf and it be good for a week or more, buy the same loaf and it be going after two days! (I should check the dates in the store more closely I guess) "
"It helps to store it in the freezer, and take out a slice or two as needed... but it is fine."
"If the bread ain't moldy, just toast it. Sorted. "
I bought a day old bakery baguette from Walmart for .39 and it was damn good.
"There's a difference between expiration dates and sell by dates. Most products have sell by dates, which is there for a store to remove product for optimal freshness. It doesn't necessarily mean the product is bad. I never look at the date on my bread after I bring it home. FYI I work in a grocery store and am a certified food manager (food safety certification)."
"I didn't even know expiration dates came on bread, I've never checked. But even after it's stale you can turn it into French toast or just fry it in oil. When mine gets mold spots I just cut them off with a knife.

Interesting note: we have had a partial loaf of Bimbo white bread leftover from a camping trip in January sitting on our counter. No mold, still squishy. Very disconcerting."
"If you dine and dash, that's theft.  If you switch tags on items at a store, that's theft.  If your behavior leaves a victim, that's evil.  

If you ignore the ""best by"" date on bread and don't send it to the landfill who is the victim?  No, victim, no problem.  I am not so good that my bread must be ""best.""

If the bread is moldy and you cover the mold with peanut butter and give it to your children I would call that questionable.  If you are eating the same stuff because it is all you have I would not call that evil.  Gross maybe, a difficult choice maybe, but I wouldn't put it in the same category as not feeding them.  You can probably do better next time.  
"
"Companies calculate these dates very carefully for two reasons.

First, it lets stores know when the item passes optimal selling freshness.

Second, it makes a lot of people throw away perfectly good food (and forces them to buy more) because they think it's ""expired"".

I wouldn't care all that much about the date on the item. If it's still good, it's still good."
Expiration dates on food are generally just a rough guide to freshness and most often just a joke.
"this... there is very little science behind the dates on food, and very little agreement about which ones to use where and why... it's mostly a conservative estimate for stores to sell the food by... not when it will go bad... for example the yogurt I buy, or just about anything with garlic in it... lasts a month or more past the date on the package... but strawberries... you're lucky to get them home without them molding... and the date on bottled water is more for the bottle than the water

if you have trouble eating a whole loaf before it goes bad, freeze half in another bag (maybe the bag from the previous loaf if it wasn't molded?) as soon as you get it home."
Thanks. So for me eating the bread 1-2 days past is like same as fresh and healthy :)
Do you not like...smell the milk?
Recently became lactose intolerant myself.... it sucks. 
"yes, there's also health risk involved in using expired milk."
"Yes, I always check the expiry before buying anything. It's really important."
"Thanks, I often don't store in the freezer. It gets dry"
Interesting to know that. I always check the expiry before buying anything.
"really informative, thanks."
"I don't smell much of anything lol.

Also, when I can smell, *all* milk smells sour to me. I literally can't tell what is actually bad and what's just regular ass, gross, ""you gonna shit yoself"" milk"
"Your freezer may not be working properly then- letting things thaw and refreeze- but if so, you may not have a way to get a better one.  It helps to seal tightly and remove as much air as you can.

edit typo"
"It doesn't actually dry. Bread hardens (its starch crystallizes) if it's cold but not freezing. That's why putting bread in the refrigerator is a bad idea.

Putting bread in the freezer should not cause it to suffer at all. It should freeze/unfreeze quickly enough that practically no crystallization occurs. If it's happening to you, your freezer may indeed be experiencing issues."
"Definitely check sell by dates before you buy to make sure you are getting as fresh as possible, but once it's purchased, just keep in mind you don't need to throw it away on that date. Of course, this depends on the product, things like animal products can be dangerous, but a bag of rice or loaf of bread, not so much."
"Two sons of an old coworker of my grandfather‚Äôs started doing this with VW busses in high school. They‚Äôd by em cheap, fix em up just a bit, and sell em for a profit. It started as a way for them to help pay their ways through college but ended up turning into a business. Last I heard (which was about 8-10 years ago), they had made profits of well over a million dollars. Not too bad for a couple kids trying to make a few extra bucks."
"Just bought a 1996 Cavalier. It had been auto, but previous owner did a motor/transmission swap to manual. But they couldn't get it going again, so sold it for 500$. Took 3.5 hrs for bf and I to get it running and it cost nothing in parts (it was just some mixed up wiring). It was an awesome find."
"I did this with motorcycles and mopeds for a bit when I was younger. 

Started with a 1960-70(?) Batavus moped with a seized engine for $200. Got it unseized but still not running. Sold it for $600. Then bought a 1975(?) Puegoet moped and rode that for a bit until the ignition coil started going out. Sold it for $800. My next purchase was the best deal I made. $400 for a 1965 Honda trail 50. Not the easiest of little bikes to find, but this guy had one and he didn't know much about it. Took it home, reupholstered the seat, added an airfilter cover and put 200 miles on her to get her to 666 miles. Sold it for $1600 sight unseen to a gentleman who lived 3 states away. Then went on to buy a few more bigger bikes and ultimately sold my last bike, a Suzuki sv650, and had to use the money for something other than a bike. 

I forget all the years so I gave my best approximation. Except the Honda, it was for sure a 65. "
"Do you live somewhere they use road salt? I have found that cars in that range of years that have not been taken care of have massive damage from rust and hence would not pass safety. I've lost thousands trying the same thing, couldn't look behind the bumper from the ground. "
"Can confirm for Jeeps...they are ridiculous for keeping their value. TJs and older usually have the bulletproof I6, they are dead simple to work on, parts are plentiful, and they have a diehard following. As long as the frame and body aren't completely rusted out, you can flip them easily. My first YJ was bought for $1200 and ended up with a blown engine by the time I was done. That sold for $800 as is, and the guy that bought it from me flipped it immediately for $1200 by just welding on a front tow bar. That next person rebuilt the engine and is still driving it around.

""Just Empty Every Pocket"" applies to the diehards. You can easily make money if you know how to do it right. "
"Whats your strat for finding cars, do you go to rich neighborhoods or...?"
Don't you need to worry about titles/registrations and other car buying expenses like insurance?
[removed]
I do the same thing! Convert a liability into an asset. Most people are afraid of used vehicles for some reason. But I'm sure as hell not paying $500 a month plus $500 insurance to own a new vehicle that's just depreciating. It's not for everyone but I love my older cars and I love knowing I can at least break even selling them. The occasional extra maintenance is still cheaper than making monthly payments on something.
Do you have to get these $500 cars safetied for the road. Full Time mechanic and in Ontario cars like this wouldn‚Äôt pass saftey. Usually 1-2 K to get them on the road. Also you prob don‚Äôt have any emissions regulations I‚Äôm going to guess. That stuff can be expensive to fix.
What are you doing with for taxes & DMV costs?
Only three per year in Virginia and each vehicle owned has personal property tax. Not a good return on car flipping. 
"My neighbor is selling a Buick Wildcat (I believe he's the original owner) for $450, and I'm really tempted to buy it every time I walk past. He's an old man, so it's not on Craigslist and he's been trying to sell it for a long time, just by occasionally parking it on the street with a for sale sign (that's illegal in our city, so you have to be careful that the cops don't ticket you; they're dicks). "
The fact that you found a Tacoma for that cheap makes me really jealous.
"When people are like yay look at my old car i'm frugal, i post these

http://www.iihs.org/iihs/topics/t/general-statistics/fatalityfacts/passenger-vehicles

Now i understand we can't all afford a new car, but it's something to at least think about IMO. I drove a 98 civic until recently and got a newer Civic after getting a new job so I've been there. 

"
"I've know several people do this and work their way up. Buy a vehicle for $2,000, drive it for six months, sell it for $3k. Buy a car for $3k, drive it for a year, sell it for $4k. And on and on. "
So what you're saying is that I can make money as a used car dealer? Good to know!!! 
And the secret to making money on the stock market is buying cheap and selling high.
How do you determine what the value of a car is? 
"I've definitely considered this, I have a natural knack for tinkering with things, and I do all my own auto work (including a few engine swaps).

I came to the conclusion though that the effort was not worth the time or stress. Too often you're buying someone else's problem. Which is fine if all you're doing is buying a car to flip it. It would not work as a daily driver for \*most\* people. I don't have to worry about breaking down on my way to work. My uncle owned a tranny shop and would flip cars all the time on the side. It worked for him because he had the tools, the work space, and the knowledge. For us driveway mechanics though, it's definitely so easy. Kudos to you for making it work. "
"I paid $1200 for a 98 Camry and was hit twice. First time I got a $1400 check, second time a $1200 check. All the damage is localized to the rear driver side door and rear driver side quarter panel. Does this count?

Edit: mind you it had 214,000 miles when I bought it and is currently at 245,000 miles"
Who in the hell is so painfully oblivious to the internet that they can't do a litterally one minute search to sell their GIANT MACHINE and find the general value of it? It's not like it's 1980-90s where anything goes. It's not difficult to find the value of a vehicle so poorly that you sell it for nickles.

"I would think they wouldn't work out after emmisions, registration, taxes, trips to motor vehicle? Are you figuring in all this time and money? Where do you sell your cars? My father just got a used car and hates it but I figured he would lose a ton of money by selling it. He really wants another Jeep Wrangler but couldn't afford it. 

Also where do you live? I wonder if your area is just better suited. I'm in CT."
"I did that with my bicycle. bought second hand and sold at $10 extra. I felt richly satisfied.

now I just wish I had made it a business"
I currently do this with motorcycles. It's great spending cash
This is not really being paid to drive your own vehicles. This is simply reselling vehicle purchased inexpensively. Not really /r/frugal material IMO. 
When I list my winter beaters there's always a couple guys who roll in looking for that diamond deal. Sorry bro it's a 15yr old clapped out JGC I drove in the salt and haven't washed in 5yrs. It's worth what it's listed at. 
"Fellow car guy here.

I'm like you, but I usually buy an old car fot cheap that needs some mechanic work like some oil leaks, tune up, maybe some suspension parts.

I fix it myself and drive them into the ground."
"I've been doing this since I was in high school. It helps that I worked in the auto industry for many of those years and had access to a shop and got wholesale pricing on parts. I agree with you 100% they have to have some kind of niche/cool factor. I stopped counting how many I've had but its probably somewhere close to 360 cars, 60 motorcycles, 50 boats and 2 planes. I don't do it for the money, I do it for fun and to have had the experience of owning so much funky shit. Two weeks ago I bought a RAV4 2 door soft top for $700 and sold it for $2500. Last week it was an '85 Mercedes 380SL $1500 sold for $3000. This week it's a Suzuki Sidekick and a '94 Miata $2k w/ 40k miles. "
Hmmmmm. Seems like the line between frugality and conman are beginning to blur.
"Why don‚Äôt you buy more cars and instantly sell them without driving them? You seem to have a good idea how the system works, so why not take advantage of it?"
Recommendations for a good model used mini-van for around $6k?   I've got a 2005 T&C now with 200k miles but it's starting the death by a 1000 paper cuts.
"2,500 for a Tacoma is a steal. Are you sure you haven't sold your soul to the devil for these deals?"
"> I buy cars that need work, fix them up, and then sell them back at a profit

All that text instead of just saying this.

If you're not mechanically-inclined, this is useless"
"This is a great strategy and you know your stuff about cars. Unfortunately, it's not as easy everywhere in the world as some countries tax you heavily just to buy and license cars. In Austria, getting a car licensed to your name and getting a license plate will cost you about 180 Euros  (210 dollars) for every new or used car you get. "
where do you typically check prices? KBB?maybe look at a bunch of Craigslist posts to find an average?
"I know someone who did this for a while full time, and still does it as a part time job.  In addition to what you mentioned, he has alerts set up on Cragistlist, and gets a lot of his cars because he's willing to drive a couple hours out to the sticks.  He'll find a good deal out in bumfark, drive out, trailer it back.  Do some basic tune up work if needed, and then sell it locally (in a major metro area)."
"I've done somewhat similar. I've found cars in good mechanical shape but brutalized cosmetically. I repair seats, defog headlights, fix paint and dents, etc and it brings the value right up. Bought an 03 Pontiac (Grand Am was it?) That had been smoked in for dirt cheap. Replaced the driver seat, got rid of as much of the smoke smell as possible and sold for profit"
"This is cool man, I have a Co worker who does this pretty effectively as well.

Do you ever worry about buying a car with some inevitable flaw that you don't see before you buy?

Had any bad buys you lost a lot on? "
"I‚Äôve been pretty lucky, without any major problems. A lot of them can be avoided if you know what to look for. "
I can't get past the part where you were buying cars in high school. Wat???
Back in the 60's and 70's my dad did a similar thing but only with Mini's.  He had 17 of them in total and since he knew the car inside and out and it was pretty simple mechanically he did well out of it.
"Not to be the stat stickler here, but did you account for opportunity cost? In other words is the amount you're saving by driving old cars equal or greater to what you COULD make in that same time frame it takes you to flip them? I'd argue if you spend more than an hour or 2 a day on these projects you're already in a time/opportunity debt without realizing it..

If you're spending all this time researching, meeting to haggle, phone tag, stuck on the side of the road for hose that just went, minor repair work, etc...what are you missing out on? Maybe putting those hours into building an actual used car business if that's what you're into, maybe taking on a different company position that pays better? Just throwing it out there, everything has a price and most don't account for the hidden time costs anything comes with."
"Basically what the guy selling ‚ÄúExotic Car Hacks‚Äù says about driving exotic cars for next to nothing.

It‚Äôs all about how you buy them "
"Buy low, sell high... you may have discovered general business sense =)"
Do you get them inspected by a reputable mechanic or do you know enough about cars to do it yourself?
I do this with desktops and laptops on a smaller scale. The margins are slim but it is fun when I find something rare.
"I used to have a similar skill back in high school. Living in a rural area, and all our family acquaintances always knew of cheap vehicles for sale. They ran alright, but we're nothing to special.
Anytime anyone needed a car quick, fast and cheap in my school, I got the calls left and right. It wasn't too bad of a gig. I padded a couple bucks for my troubles, but a small way to make a quick buck."
"[Peter Pocklington](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pocklington), former owner of the Edmonton Oilers, started off his career doing basically the same thing as a teenager."
I do this too with vans :)
Any advice on finding them besides driving around ? Would love pick up
"It doesn't hurt to try craigslist either, just gotta get there quick with cash.

I bought a 92 Silverado 2500 a few years back for $2,000. I found it on craigslist and bought it within the hour. Only had 126k miles and was in fine shape other than a broken radio. I put in a $40 radio, drove it for a year and sold it for $3,500. I made a profit even if you factor in gas, oil and insurance..."
Very impressive! Wondering what older BMWs you think have a high value still? Looking at a 92 318 Convertable for 2k... worthy for buy and flip?

"I had a coworker who did this with Porsche 911s.  There are an unsurprisingly large number that get totaled due to driver stupidity.   They guy buys the hulk and scavenges parts. He takes a decent frame then builds a franken-Porsche on top of it. Drove it around for a bit on salvage title and then sells it. He‚Äôs been doing this since college and I don‚Äôt know if he makes money on it, it at least breaks even. "
Have you considered going to local car auctions and maybe turning it into a business/used car dealership?
You're my hero
I am also a flipper. I'm on my 32nd car and 36th motorcycle. Knowing your market is the key to any success at this. 
"I love that you do this. I had thought about doing some kind of vehicle arbitrage for family road trips where I would buy at the start and sell at the end, then vice versa or fly back. But just owning a car and selling higher at the end... brilliant"
Thanks for a great perspective 
"I have a friend who does this... It seems to work well and he doesn't even work on the cars (other than cosmetic stuff)...

I'm not that great of a haggler so not sure if it would work for me.... Sure does sound like fun though"
"It could also be worth your while to travel a short distance to get good deals. Ie from the maonland to vancouver island. Plenty of seniors selling wel cared for, easy driven behicles for less. "
"Classic cars can work that way. Bought a 70 Chevelle convertible for 8K. Had it for 7 years Paid to replace the engine and rebuild the transmission and sold it for every penny I put into it. Over 43 years, I have spent a net total of under $35,000 on cars. Currently have scooters and bicycles. Even more frugal as weekly gas is less than $5"
"For those of you considering this good luck, there's definitely money to be made. Just be careful because in some states this is called acting as an unlicensed dealer and can get you in a shitload of trouble. "
Open a business.
i doubt very much if a 14yo cap would sell for $500 around here.. i see them sitting on craigslist on the free listings and no one wants them .. that said yeah its a good deal to own... at the very least you can sell the vehicle and most  vehicles will sell for something .. even if its $500 from the scrap place.
"I did this a lot with mustangs. See one with no plates, stop and ask about it, end up paying 500-1500 for them. Clean it up and take it out cruising, people ask ""hey you wanna sell?"" ""Sure I'll take 2500 for it"". I've think I've flipped about 10-12 like this."
"‚ÄúMake use of arbitrage opportunities, even with high ticket price items like vehicles.‚Äù 

Ok thanks "
"I would love to live this way, but the problem is I don't know the first thing about cars. I got a brand new mazda 3 in 2016, and I've already driven 50,000 miles on it. I shutter to think how much net worth I lost doing this but I really had no choice with my lack of knowledge about cars."
">My current vehicle is a 2004 Toyota Tacoma that I paid $2,500 for

Come to california and sell it for an easy 10k. "
"I would love to do this. But living in a state with sales tax, it makes turning a profit that much harder."

Potentially getting seriously injured in a wreck in an old jalopy != Frugal.
Not bad at all! There is a huge market for those vw busses with the whole minimal living on the road movement. They bring in quite a premium. Seems like they had no problem cashing in on that

Did they finish college is the larger question lol
Nice job! I had an old cavalier z24 myself for a while. It was a nice little car.
"Phew!  You got lucky - I replaced the head gasket on my 1995 Cavalier three times.  The leaks and problems got to so such a thing that my family would get twelve-packs of oil for my birthday.  I usually went through 12 quarts of oil in 3 months.

After that Cavalier fiasco, my extended family didn't buy another GM for 22 years.  It was me who took a leap and got a 2017 Volt and honestly, I love it.

Nice job! Always a great feeling being able to make money doing what you enjoy. I never got into mopeds/motorcycles.
So is 666 miles a selling point?
"Ya, I bought a 2003 Ninja 250 for $2500 in 2012 one state over (under 5K miles). Drove it to my campus and put a few hundred more miles on it in grad school (still under 10K) and laid it down (bent the brake pedal and put a few small scratches on the back end) and sold it in 2013 for $2500 to some 16 year old that was dying to get a cheap bike to ride.

If I hadn't laid it down I probably could have gotten a few hundred more."
"We do use road salt, so a little rust is expected. I pass on the really bad stuff though."
"If you're buying a car in the rust belt, you should at least be jacking it up and taking a good look underneath. If that's not your thing, then you should be getting a pre-purchase inspection from an independent shop. Even (especially) if you're buying from a dealership."
"This is what I am wondering, I am in the salt belt and basically every car here is rusted out. Including mine!"
What's a safety inspection?
"For sure! I realized as long as they are not rotted to hell, someone will pay a premium."
"A guy on a forum I used to frequent made a heathy secondary living by flipping jeeps


He'd buy a medium mileage stock or nearly stock TJ, install a modest lift kit and slightly bigger mud tires, and high school kids/military guys would buy them immediately 

He'd profit 1500-2000 or more per vehicle 

But he had to start with private sales and did the lift work himself "
Can some explain this Jeep thing to me please... Everyone says Jeeps are unreliable and that you have to spend a lot of money on maintenance. But then again they say that Jeeps hold their value well. How does that work?
"I just picked up my TJ last month. Zero rust, 52k miles, one owner, has factory D44, cruise control, ac, and a few other options. Got it for $6.5k and invested $600 to freshen it up. I feel I can drive it around for a couple years and still make a profit.

A way to get around that is when you get the car, to have the seller just give you the title and you as buyer don't sign it. That way you aren't listed as the owner. The problem with that though is you can't drive the car legally. Also some people think you are scheming if you aren't on the title. "

be careful especially with cheap motorcycles. make sure you get a valid title and check the vin that it matches the title and that it looks untampered with on the headstock. lots of stolen bikes out there that have had re-stamped vins etc.

Mandatory inspection on all sold used vehicles before they can be licensed under a new owner. Has to be done by a certified mechanic and it had to meet a certain level of worthiness for the road. Any significant damage to a frame nulls the vehicle really. 
"Demand, plain and simple. Emotion driven demand. And it's baffling, because a Grand Cherokee and Wrangler of the same vintage and condition will be very far apart on price. Like, $5 for the Grand Cherokee and $12k for the Wrangler. And the Grand Cherokee is the nicer vehicle!

In fact, you should never, ever buy a 1-2 year old Wrangler, because you can get a brand new one for 2% below invoice with the tread lightly discount and pay less money. Not that you should necessarily do that, either, if you're trying to save money.

I had a guy come knock on my door unsolicited looking to buy my LJ. I didn't ask him how much he thought it was worth. I expected he was thinking in the $5-6k range so I didn't even bother to ask him. Maybe I made a mistake?"

Also they're not all unreliable. The inline 6 the GP mentioned is considered one of the most bulletproof engines in history. I have one in an XJ (Cherokee) and I just rolled over 300k miles pretty recently. I've changed 2 parts and the oil in about 4 years."
"People spend a lot of money on maintenance because they are taking them into the woods and beating the hell out of them. Things tend to break when you hit that giant rock you didn't know about in that mud hole. Under ""normal"" use, mall crawler Jeeps are no more maintenance than any other vehicle, with a slight exception due to the 4X4 increasing some costs. As for reliability, they are as dependable as hell. The YJ with the blown head gasket still drove for another month before I sold it. The new owner replaced the gasket and did a few other repairs, and it was good as new again. That I6 engine can take a lot of abuse and still keep ticking.

They hold their value because of their reliability, and because they are a ton of fun. But it's not something that can be explained. You have to drive it to get the feel for it. Those that like them will absolutely love them. Those that don't will never understand those that do. It's a Jeep thing..."
"Would you say most deals you find are ones that aren't listed in ads/classified/craigslist? Seems like these would be hard to find because people would snatch them up.

"Interesting, what state are you in and do you buy most of the cars there?"
"$600 a year for just liability is ridiculously high in New York unless you live in NYC. I'm in Syracuse and I'm paying only $880 with $50k renters insurance included for full coverage with $0 glass, roadside, accident forgiveness, $100k/$300k coverage instead of state minimum $25k/$50k, extra income loss, higher daily max for rental, and even extra coverage on the renters such as identity theft, $10k for immediate housing and clothing expenses, equipment breakdown, and more.   


I used to shop all the big advertised insurers every year and thought I was getting the best rate, until I took my policy into an independent agent who ran me through 2 dozen insurer's and found I was overpaying by about 75&#37; and didn't have as much coverage as I should have."
You have to pay rego & insurance etc on a car you're driving anyway....
"Don‚Äôt forget that since your making money off these cars that you have to report the income on your taxes.

"Sales tax on a $2,500 car in NY is $112.5. Not bad at all."

So do you buy another car before you sell that one? Or just go without until you find a deal?
"I buy used cars, too, and maintain them, so I'm on the same page as you.  

However ""better off"" is a subjective statement.  You seem to be suggesting ""lowest spend while possessing the car"" is ""better"", and I agree with you, but for some people, that's not as important as being able to predict the cost  every month or having greater reliability (which they believe a new car will) or having full warranty coverage or having the latest features or whatever their reasoning.  What is better for you is not better for everyone.

Now, if they lease themselves a fully loaded top tier vehicle, then bitch that it's costing them so much money, well, that's another issue."
A lot of people I know are very afraid of car problems. For some reason they also assume buying new from a dealership means no problems.
Oh I pay $500 a year per car for liability. If you buy something brand new with a loan on average is around $500/MONTH for full coverage. 
Ya I figured. Good on ya just wouldn‚Äôt fly in Ontario. I‚Äôm jealous lol. 
Since your buying off a private seller and exchanging cash do you even have to pay taxes on that? I thought a great advantage of buying off private sellers is not having to pay taxes .

Also I think you glossed over the most difficult part of the whole thing: if you're able to buy vehicles for the 3k example price, it's going to be difficult selling them for the 4k or just under everyone else is selling for. "

"I started at 12yo with an 83 Ramcharger from my Spanish Teacher for $75. It was a 318 Auto, 4x2, with holes through the floor, warped rotors, and a leak in the windshield. Used lawn mowing money to fix the brakes and sold it for $300. Rolled than into a 64 Ford Falcon with a 351 Cleveland (a side of the road way out in the boonies find) for $500. I never took the for sale sign out of the back window and in got sold the next day by some random that knocked and asked if it was for sale......for $3000. After that deal it was about 4 cars/year flipping through high school. Most were less than $500 and sold for a couple hundred profit after tune ups or paint and body work. I still have the car ADD and go through 2/year average. I am not profiting like I used to, but I make sure to break even after title transfer fees. I just got rid of my longest ride, a 65 Cutlass coupe with a 455, buckets, factory tach, and power windows. I've had that car for a very long time, but the inner seals in the trans were leaking and it will not shift right until it is warmed up (did not want to have another rebuilt trans done). I traded it for a Frontier 5spd and am pleased. The wife said I have to keep it for at least 2 years, and I have to sell my other cars. Finally coming to a flipping end."
"Why did you say you started in high school and changed cars every few months, but your first car you kept for two years?"

"**Rust Belt**

The Rust Belt is a region of the United States, made up mostly of places in the Midwest and Great Lakes, though the term may be used to include any location where industry declined starting around 1980. Rust refers to the deindustrialization, or economic decline, population loss, and urban decay due to the shrinking of its once-powerful industrial sector. The term gained popularity in the U.S. in the 1980s.

The Rust Belt begins in western New York and traverses west through Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Ohio, Indiana, and the Lower Peninsula of Michigan, ending in northern Illinois, eastern Iowa, and southeastern Wisconsin.

I think it simply comes down to value. Some people are perfectly fine paying whatever the $ amount is to enjoy the car they want to be in. That money isn't an issue to them, so it really shouldn't be anyone else's (judgement) either.

"I wish new cars were more reliable. Seems as of late they are in the shop just as much as cars ten years older than them. Recalls, electronic system issues, etc..."
"It isn't $500 month for full coverage for insurance in New York state thankfully. I have some friends who pay $100 a month for full coverage but that's because they have accidents/tickets or bad credit. My Ford Focus was bought brand new and full coverage with higher liability coverage was only around $900/year, but I also had issues with credit at the time. My credit score is back over 800 again and my Ford Flex even with everything including my renters insurance is only $880 year. And I'm a 36 year old male. Never had a ticket in my life.

No they closed that poor person's loophole a while ago. (How dare those people with so little get away without paying the government a few hundred bucks) They always have a book value price of the car and you have to pay the taxes for that price or the price you paid for whichever is higher.  Why there is any tax at all on a vehicle that has already had taxes paid on it is already offensive.

Technically you're supposed to pay taxes on profits from a yardsale, too."
"At the dmv there is a form you still have to fill out to pay sales tax, unfortunately. "
In my state you have to pay the taxes when you register. You see a lot of temp plates that have been expired for years because people blow all their money on the car and don't pay the taxes
"Don't forget taxes, registration, and insurance"
"But it, put it on Craigslist for $1000, and profit away!!"

It's about flipping time!

"That is a little different, in the sense that the customer is not setting the price. Your bosses/managers are. If they charge a price that is not fair, that is taking advantage of someone. If someone is setting their own price and they are happy to get it, how can that be taking advantage of them? If they want top dollar for what they own, they can do all the research and legwork that it takes to get max dollar for it."
Probably easier to float titles.
"You're sounding like an edgelord, man. People have engaged in trade since LOOOONG before capitalism was ever conceived of. Humans pit their negotiation skills against one another in ALL societies. It's not implicitly immoral or predatory."
So you always pay more for goods and services than you have to so you avoid ripping someone off? Do you go to the gas station in town that charges the most for gas to make sure you're not ripping off the less expensive guys? 
"Our system is beautiful, isn‚Äôt it?"
Now yeah. I'm sure he bought the 95 Mustang before those were a thing or at least affordable.
I am not arguing that a modern car is safer than an older one. I agree with you there. But the fact that my truck was built in 2004 does not make it unsafe. I cannot comment on motorcycles because i have never owned one.

Which is why Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg went back to finish at Harvard after becoming billionaires. 

Of course there is ‚Äúvalue‚Äù in getting a degree. The difference is that if you are very successful without college, the value of the degree is likely significantly reduced in comparison to what you are doing. Once the degree becomes less valuable than what you‚Äôre doing, it is nonsensical to continue pursuing it. "

"But the ""profits"" from a yardsale are only money you make over what you originally paid for the items, which at a yard sale will almost always be nothing. You are only taxed on income over the basis. (For example, if you bought a book for $10 and sold it at a yard sale for $1, you don't pay tax. If you bought it for $10 and sold it for $11, you'd pay tax on the $1 profit you made.) So unless you get a bunch of stuff for free and then sell it at your yardsale, or you're selling lots of antiques that have appreciated in value or something, you probably aren't supposed to pay tax on the money from your yardsale."
The nice thing about paying cash is the amount you write on the form and the amount of actual cash you paid don't have to be reconciled.
"Wow I had no idea, I was thinking of buying a used car of a private dealer to save money as well as on taxes but I may have to reconsider that now. Im located in California DMV for sure will find a way to nickle and dime me."

I think people freak out of the high initial cost of these, but they forget that in 5 years they will still be able to sell it for almost exactly what they paid for it after putting on 50k miles."

"You are technically supposed to claim and pay a use tax on all extra income and purchases that you didn't pay sales tax on. No one does, which is why we're starting to see states pushing for all websites to collect taxes."
"In the US, you can buy used clothing and household items from consignment and thrift stores, used furniture stores, used vehicles at car lots, used tools, electronics, and jewelry at pawn shops, etc. In all of these scenarios you will be paying sales tax on the used items. The retailer collects the sales tax, just like a retailer selling new items collects the sales tax."
"the government still performs a service in transferring ownership etc, so they need their buck."
"Sorry, I meant private sales and should have said that explicitly. I was thinking of everything I've bought from Craigslist , Kijiji , eBay, etc"
"Here in Ontario, we pay for vehicle registration and licensing every year (or two, if you double up); the sales tax on used vehicle private sales is complete cash grab  bullshit. "
That's a registration fee. Seperate from the tax
"In my experience, eBay does collect taxes on transactions in the US. Now for Craigslist, there's no mechanism because cash payments aren't recorded anywhere. But in the case of vehicles, some states consider them to be ""property"", like land where you pay taxes annually. In that case, you pay tax on land, homes, or vehicles annually no matter where you bought it or how you paid. Even if you paid cash for a piece of land, the state or local government is going to be sending a tax bill each year."
Yea everything you bought on craigslist was supposed to be taxed and if you buy anything from a serious seller on eBay they are paying taxes. Paypal reports income to the IRS and I see people on eBay charging sales tax all the time.
every sale ever is taxed how is that a cash grab? Are taxes a cash grab? Well kinda I guess.
"> In my experience, eBay does collect taxes on transactions in the US.

Only if you're in the same state.  Otherwise nothing.

edit.  I'm not actually sure you even pay it then.  I just had some stuff ship to me in state with no sales tax, so I don't know.  But by and large there's few times I've been charged sales tax on eBay."
Can you explain what I'm supposed to do with the sales tax I'm supposed to  collect selling some speakers or an old bike or something on Craigslist?
You are supposed claim it on your taxes like all income. Usually you pay the tax every quarter. Yea no one does this but its still the law.

"And get your backpacks from a thrift shop.  My brother just got one of those super tricked out Swiss army ones for $5 in basically brand new condition.  

Honestly the bag section of goodwill has been very productive for me.  It‚Äôs one section where they almost always have a fair price on stuff.  I‚Äôve been charged $25 for a pair of Nikes (pretty sure the mentally challenged guy made a mistake because they said 9.99) but I‚Äôve never seen a bag for over $15, though some are extremely valuable! "
"I go to thrift stores after the school shopping craze is over and stock up in advance, that way the next year I have significantly less to buy full price. I don't know if it's the same every where, but the schools here are very specific about what brands we have to buy, like Ticonderoga number two pencils and Crayola everything, so hitting up the donations from Target is more beneficial in our case."
Office Depot and Staples will have things for pennies in the month of August.
"Office supply stores start having sales on back to school stuff in mid-July and continue through labor day.  If you visit regularly, you can get a fair amount of stuff priced at one cent to one dollar per (with limits on how many you can get of an item)."

"Target, Staples, Walmart, Office Max are great places to get back to school supplies.  At the end of September they will practically give away the overstock- I always stocked up on extra art supplies for my daughter."
"And the off-brand products don't work as well. Pencils with silver metal around the eraser - super cheap and super bad. The lead is loose in the wood, they will need constant sharpening and will not last. Get the gold rim or better, green/yellow rim. 

$Store crayons are the worst - they are like birthday candles. Get Crayolas, not Rose Art or other off-brands.

Liquid soap in those little dispensers are $1, but they have fewer fld. oz than the ones in the grocery store. 

I dislike Walmart intensely, but they do have great sales on school supplies. Prices go up after the school year starts, so get them during the school supply season."
I didn't consider that. Been a minute since I've been to any other stores tbh. I don't really go anywhere lol 
Good looking out! Thrift stores do get the greatest stuff sometimes
I was just lazy talking lol. What's DDLG tho? 
"Target has some good deals if you combine their app deals, coupons and the Target Red Card.  The only time it really sucks is when teachers get super specific about brands.

Yes. I‚Äôd like to know how I can make money without investing much time or money too. 
"Everyone would like a way to passively make money, with minimal time and involvement. When you figure out how, let us know."
"There is no way to make passive income that you can actually use with that little money. Any investment scheme requires a time horizon of years, not monthly.

You are much better off concentrating on college and picking an in-demand major to maximize future income potential than worrying about getting invested.

Check out /r/personalfinance/ to get started."
"It really depends on how much you want to work and what there is available in your area. This might not be what you are looking for but an article came to mind when I read this. There is also a book with a similar title

https://www.thepennyhoarder.com/make-money/100-summer-jobs-for-teens

Most of these can be done year round and help you network in your community. They also require much less time than a part time job, and can be a chance for you to learn how to sell yourself and build clientele. 

If you are looking for a much more passive for of income then I would suggest trying to see what you can do with your current hobbies and activities. Whether it's baking for your neighbors or painting miniatures for dungeons and dragons players in your area. "
Make an IRA and put it in medium risk. Try to add money each month. If you do it right. Retirement will be nice
"100% passive income stream doesn't exist as such. Doing no work at all is delusional.

I know, a passive income would be something like patent licensing fees or owning the rights to a few songs that you sell on iTunes but even a profitable YouTube video still needs to have ongoing marketing. If you don‚Äôt promote your video, your song the income will get lower and lower. Been there, done that. The sad truth is: if you don't do anything to nurture your passive income sources they will dry out. Although there's no real passive income here are some [side hustle ideas](http://selleratheart.com/side-hustle-passive-income/) which can create almost passive income with a minimum of work."
"Sell drugs, not exactly passive, but about as close as you can get with that little amount."

"It's honestly the best way to have your money work for you. You could invest in stable stocks such as Walmart or Microsoft but the market is too hot and alot of the stock values now are very inflated. I bought a number of shares back in 2014-15 and I've gotten about 40% ROI but a good chuck of that growth came in '16 and ' 17 when everything artificially skyrocketed due to regulation reforms. So, at this moment in time, I'd wait. Everything will cool off and you can invest in stocks again but if you wait too long you'll lose out on the low interest rate for home loans. I'm not sure if I've made any sense, i tend to ramble."

I predict this downturn lasts another 6 months to 2 years. In January the US government said Bitcoin and crypto are technologies we need to stay competitive. This essentially tells businesses that crypto is okay. Since then, the price of bitcoin has went down. In 2017, bitcoin was not 'legal'.

I do not trust alt coins because they are untested and blockchain is expensive verification that isnt needed for most purposes.   Bitcoin uses validation and economics to store value and people around the world trust it. "

Rotisserie chicken are larger than grocery stores and only $5. Makes several meals and even stock if you‚Äôre hardcore.
"At Sam's club we usually buy cleaning supplies, papertowel, toilet paper, bulk foodsl that have a long shelf life and meat that can be divided and frozen. Pretty much anything you use regularly and won't go bad. 

Tires and service center along with 10 cent cheaper than average gas is what really makes it worth its cost for me."
"We shop at Costco and I think it's worth it. We have found good deals on coffee, cheese and dairy, alcohol, cleaning products, over counter medicine, soap and hygiene products, tuna, spices, olive oil, and nuts. 

I have found produce to be a mixed bag. The prices are often good, but it's easy to buy too much and have things go bad before you use them up. The same is true for things like batteries and office supplies. I don't need 20 sharpies at once no matter how cheap it is per sharpie. There are also tons of convenience foods and options for impulse buys and those are not great deals."
Trash bags. We bought a box of trash bags from Costco almost 2 years ago and still haven‚Äôt used them up. And we take our trash out at least once a day. 
Do you have any pets? I save so much on dog food when I buy from costco. I can get good quality grain free (1 dog has allergies) for way cheaper than any other store/website.

"Buying organic fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds at Costco has saved me a lot of money.

I prefer to buy organic produce fresh, not frozen. To each, their own.

Frozen organic fruits and vegetables will be slightly more affordable than fresh organic fruits and vegetables.

Buying in bulk at Costco has not only saved me money, but also time, which is more valuable than money in my opinion. On the rare occasion that I need groceries that Costco doesn't have (such as organic fresh herbs: cilantro, thyme, basil, oregano, rosemary), I'll go to Trader Joe's or Whole Foods.

Everything else, I can find it at Costco for a price that simply can't be beat by other companies/vendors/merchants.

Last, but not least, be sure to price check each Costco item before buying. Some items may be a better deal at your local supermarket, depending on their weekly sales and promotions.

Over the past 12 months, I've found that Costco's wholesale prices for (fresh and frozen) organic fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds were always lower than competitor's prices for the same items of the same amount. Your mileage may vary.

Costco's return policy is the BEST!!!
Please respect their generous return policy and DO NOT abuse it.
It's amazingly great to know that Costco stands by their products, 100% satisfaction guaranteed.
If Costco eliminates their generous return policy, I'll sadly cancel my membership.

Happy grocery shopping! :)"
"A lot of good deals on snack like items (peanut butter filled pretzels are a must at my house)

Good deals on all sorts of cheeses.

I know you dont eat meat, but for others I get all my chicken there (organic is 4.99 per pound here in Utah).  "
"Look at the metric/imperial weight of something and compare prices. Sometimes you'll be surprised that not everything is cheaper in bulk.
I memorize many of my household stables.
Sometimes the pre-sliced cheese is cheaper. It's weird yo."
"In my area, for most products, the price difference between Costco and regular grocery stores is immense. Getting a membership cut my food expenses by more than half.

Of course, it probably depends on what you buy. I mostly get pork, eggs and cream. But potatoes, fruits and vegetables are typically more expensive there than at my local fruit store. It doesn't bother me because I can't afford fruits and vegetables, but if you're a vegetarian, that's probably an issue.

Just compare prices and do the math. Otherwise, you just don't know. It might be great for you or it might not be worth it."
"The prescriptions at the Costco pharmacy are significant cheaper than other pharmacies or discount drug stores.

"I really love Costco. 

However, depending upon what you buy and how often you buy it, Aldi might be a better choice.  (Sometimes.  For some people).

Costco's beef is either Choice or Prime...no select or standard that I've ever heard tell of.  It's a good value for what it is...but perhaps not ""frugal"".

For the produce and dairy, you need to choose wisely for things that your family will eat the entire relatively large bulk of.

Clothing....Kirkland brand stuff is about all I wear now.  Well made, reasonable price.

Just generally, IMO, anything at Costco is a very good value for the quality of the item being purchased.  Some Kirkland  (Costco house brand) items are better than name brand and  the rest are just as good as name brand.  Aldi seems to have a lot of ""good as name brand"" products too at very good prices....but I'm a bit of a snob and think that Costco has products that are a bit more 'upscale' than Aldi.  And Costco has the bakery , deli, rotisserie chickens, gasoline, optical depts, etc.

As I said, I'm a bit of a snob.  But Sam's Club always struck me as buying Walmart quality,  in bulk.   It'll be cheap.  But maybe not a good value in the long run."
"I agree! And for me, Costco saves on gas so much my savings more than doubles the cost of the membership! However two points I tend to be more frugal on- 

Menstrual cups are roughly $30 and last for 10 years plus no environmental waste. Way better than even bulk buys of pads/tampons. 

Books, why buy when you can rent?! Libraries are amazing things! I love owning books, but am too cheap to buy them.

"A year....?? I boiled my lady cup once a month for 9 years and I'd still use it, but after two back to back kids I needed a different size. Been using the Ruby cup for over a year and it still looks brand new! Not sure about what the diva cup claims, but the other cups I mentioned use medical grade silicone. ladycup says up to 15 years, Ruby cup says 10 years. "

"I‚Äôd maybe hit up a teacher store. My mom is always peeling annoying vinyl stickers off her boards when she switches classrooms, so I‚Äôd guess they have some there.

"Check craft groups or craft stores to see if there's a Cricket you can use, maybe for a nominal fee. I worked at a Michaels years ago and they would have a scrapbooking group in the classroom, you could bring in materials and pay a dollar to use the machine (covers the blade usage)."
"You can buy the vinyl and use an exacto knife to cut what you want.... just make sure you use transfer paper (clear contact paper).

"First frugal tip: just buy generic cyanoacrylate (CA) glue, it's a lot cheaper.   
For storage, it's important to keep it dry, *really* dry, as it is the moisture it reacts with.   
Store your glue in a screw top glass jar, as close in size to the glue container as possible, to minimize air space, and keep a silica gel desiccant packet or two in with it, to adsorb any moisture that gets in.   
Make sure to never leave the jar open, even for a few seconds, always remove the glue and promptly seal the empty jar while using glue, otherwise the desiccant will absorb moisture from the environment and quickly become useless.

If you use a lot, say for hobby purposes, it's well worth sticking a hypodermic needle in the tip for dispensing, because it's so small, in dries shut almost instantly, and if hardened, just needs a quick heating with a lighter to unclog it."

"Biggest thing is whether you buy from a private part or a dealer, pay the $100 or so to have it inspected by a professional mechanic before you buy it. This can save you thousands in maintenance by avoiding a lemon. Losing $100 to inspection fees to learn you shouldn't buy the car is $ extremely well spent."
"Think along the lines of Chevy Malibus and Impalas or Ford Fusions. Not as expensive as a Toyota or Honda but just as reliable. In your price range, you want a car that doesn't have good resale value.

Look at cars with salvage titles. Especially ones that were hail damaged as all of the issues are cosmetic which lowers the price.

Be prepared to hunt for a bit to find the right deal. And don't be scared to get up and walk away if you feel negotiations are breaking down."
"Ford Taurus. Ugly as sin, but gets 35mpg.  For example, I bought one for $400, drove it all winter, let my sister drive it for a year, and then sold it for $500. I didn't do any maintenance aside from the fluids.
I spent more in insurance than I did the car. It sure was ugly though, the 'blue bomb'."
"Subaru‚Äôs are decent, safe cars that hold their value. Shoot for under 150,000 miles. Provided the car runs well, has had the alternator and starter replaced at some point, has no fluid leaks, and no front end damage (Subaru‚Äôs front ends crunch first as a safety and rarely can be made completely right again) it probably won‚Äôt give you any issues. They‚Äôre reliable and the occasional part replacement keeps them running. Additionally they hold their value. $5,000 is a fine budget to find a suitable used Subaru that has fewer than 150,000 miles and will get you trough the next few years of life. I‚Äôve had them since I was around your age and have no complaints."
"First, figure out what you want out of a car.

"I'm not sure where you live (I assume America) but is there any independent safety testing body there? 
Australia has what we call ANCAP (Australasian New Car Assessment Program) and it gives safety ratings for all makes and models sold in Australia. It also lists the safety features. I know Europe also has something similar. 

It it was me and I had 2 cars at a similar price point (similar condition and all previous maintence etc completed) that I was looking at and 1 had a 4 * rating and the other had 5... I'd be choosing the one with the 5. "
"Have you checked how expensive it is to maintain a luxury vehicle?  You might be able to buy a used Volvo for $5K, but you won‚Äôt be able to afford to maintain it. If something goes wrong, you are going to be fucked.  As for the features you mention sacrificing, that is pretty amusing.  You aren‚Äôt going to be able to find a car in your price range that even has a back up camera.  First step is to start being realistic.  You want transportation.  Anything else you‚Äôve been dreaming of is off the table.  Find a Honda or Toyota and go with that.  Get it inspected by an independent mechanic before you sign anything.  Don‚Äôt take the seller at their word ‚Äî ever ‚Äî even if it‚Äôs someone‚Äôs elderly grandma.  A car in your price range won‚Äôt have a warranty. As for starting a thread, there are subs devoted to this topic ‚Äî entire subs. "
Often if you have had a past relationship with a mechanic they'll be willing to inspect a potential new purchase of yours for free or next to nothing. Worth an ask.
"There's something to be said for this kind of advice too. She might be able to pick up a solid old Crown Victoria cheap. Wouldn't be the prettiest, or get the best mpg but if it was an ex police vehicle, would have been maintained, and would be safe.  "

"In that case, I would suggest a Toyota Camry/Corolla/Matrix or their GM counterparts - the Chevy/Geo Prizm and the Pontiac Vibe. The Prizm & Vibe rolled out of the same factory as the Corolla and Matrix and are really just rebadged Toyotas with a lower price tag. You can get a 10-year-old example for under $5000. 

Whatever you buy, do your homework. Hit up the forums for the brand & model specific and look for any multi-page threads for a particular issue and the severity of said issue. While the ideal situation is finding a seller with detailed records, the next best thing is getting a mechanic to look through the car. 

Also! Get insurance quotes from different providers. Make sure to buy above the state minimum. "
"How much and how far do you have to drive? What kinds of conditions? There are lots of factors to think about when buying a car. 

The advice above is solid, but I wouldn't totally rule out Volvos. I've owned the classic 240 bricks in the past and those are basically indestructible. Yes, things wear out, but they stopped making them in 1993 and I bet wherever you live you can go out right now and find several tooting around.  They're not mysterious or difficult for most mechanics to work on.

 I even owned a 1983 model many years ago as a 20 year-old girl lol. It had a noisy fuel pump, and sometimes didn't like to start on rainy days. I kept the gas tank full, and sprayed the wires or parked inside if rain was forecast. I put several hundred thousand miles on it, and it never required anything special. Oil changes. Timing belt. Brakes. Basic car stuff you need to do with any car. It was a manual transmission, so gas mileage was OK. 240s go 0 to 60 in about 6 minutes. It was a very reliable car though, and I would absolutely drive one again now. I would also happily purchase one for my teenager. I'm fact, I regularly look online for 240s trying to find ones that are in good condition. Rust is a problem where I live. 

I've heard from Volvo enthusiast friends that early 2000s XC 70s are easy to find cheap right now. I decided to buy a used Honda Fit instead, which I personally think is a great little car. "
"Thanks for the tip! I‚Äôve watched a couple youtube videos about when to (and how to) replace the headgaskets on the Subaru outback and forester, so while I‚Äôm definitely no expert, I will 100% keep this in mind when I‚Äôm test driving and checking out any of the cars."
"*And timing chains... @ every 75k?  Someone set me right here.  0 clearance engine, timing chain goes and the entire engine will likely need replacing.  Cam shaft can get bent, valves etc.."
Why not the Honda counterparts? I've had a few now and they're really reliable machines. 
"Awesome, glad to hear that there‚Äôs at least of bit of truth to the anecdotes I‚Äôve heard from various people! :) My friend‚Äôs mom has a Volvo XC 60 that her sister brought back to the US with her in the ‚Äò90s after living in Sweden- and that thing is a freaking TANK, indestructible it seems! Thanks for all of the info in your comment- I think a huge takeaway that I got from it is that with any used car, regardless of brand, regular maintenance and good upkeep are what keeps ‚Äòem happy."
"The point being, given OP‚Äôs financial situation and what ‚Äúbasic‚Äù maintenance costs on luxury vehicles, she may not be able to afford even that.  I don‚Äôt recommend having a car that‚Äôs considered a luxury vehicle worked on by just anybody.  Your advice is anecdotal. "
"Only the new engines (FA and FB series) use timing chains. They are supposed to last the lifetime of the engine.

The older EJ series engines use timing belts, which are wear items and get replaced (with the water pump) every 105k miles. If you're doing the work yourself or your head gaskets are already weeping (leaking externally), might as well replace them at 105k with some nice triple layer steel gaskets, since the factory gaskets on the EJ engines were absolute balls, and you've done half the work to get to them already. (From a mechanic getting the gaskets changed during the belt replacement will add $700ish, vs being a stand-alone $2000 repair)

Yes, the EJ and FA/FB engines are both interference engines, meaning if the belt or chain breaks you are replacing a whole lot of shit."
"They're great cars, but there's additional things to watch out for, like the very necessary timing belt/water pump service as well as rust. That, and the fact that they're still at risk for theft (why I don't drive one any more) means that I'm a little less gung-ho about recommending them. "
"Your friend's mom sounds like a good local resource for you to take car shopping. Or at least to recco a mechanic to inspect any car you are serious about buying.

Maintenance is important, and the other poster is correct too about being able to afford upkeep. Find out if any car you're interested in has a timing belt or a timing chain. If it is a timing belt, you need to know when it was last changed. People sometimes sell cars that are due for this since is can be expensive. If not changed, and the belt breaks, it can destroy the engine. You want proof. Some mechanics put a sticker under the hood stating the mileage it was swapped, which is nice. Timing chains usually are good for the life of the engine. (They sometimes fail, but not commonly.) 

It's a good idea to price a set of basic tires and a new battery, for example, when buying a used car. You might not need either right away, but it's helpful to know if a set of 4 tires is going to be $300, or if one single tire is going to be close to that. I owned a Honda Pilot once, and a single tire was $250+. Ouch!

Good tires (learn the proper inflation for your car), and good brakes are really important. Get new windshield wiper blades. Those are actually pretty cheap, but you would be amazed how many people drive around with really old ones that don't properly clear their windshield. You need to see! LOL! On that note, you can buy headlight restorer for around $7 if you buy an older car, and the headlights seem a bit yellowish or scratchy. Turtlewax is a brand I've used that works really well. 

I would set aside $500 or so of your budget for repairs, if you're able. It makes it less stressful, since used cars almost always have some minor thing that needs to be fixed the first few months of ownership. 

 I haven't read the rest of this thread, but there are tons of helpful car channels on YouTube like EricTheCarGuy. Go to Playlists, then Tips, and scroll to section on buying a used car. "
"Have you ever owned a 240? It's a fairly simple, straightforward car, and Volvo used the same parts for most of the production years, which is nice. If you open the hood, it's a car. It's not ""WTF?!?"" 

I would 100 % agree with you if she was looking at BMWs, or Saabs.  I have heard some of the Volvo S60 from the first year or two had transmission issues, so I would avoid those. I prefer Volvos prior to Ford. 

I do not disagree with your suggestion to look at Hondas and Toyotas. I'm driving a Fit myself currently. 

  

"
Honda Fits have timing chains. 
"Awesome advice you‚Äôve given- especially about the timing belt/chain, I‚Äôve been a bit confused about how much consideration to give those but you‚Äôve cleared things up! I‚Äôve seen a view of EricTheCarGuy‚Äôs videos, I‚Äôll definitely have to check out more of them. Cheers! And happy cake day btw :)"

Oh wow they have really good deals. Do you know about the signal quality? Coverage maps always seem a little unreliable.
I'm in Florida and had Metro previously but not now (all the family still has it) and they initially started in the south. I know the coverage has expanded but can't really speak for how it is up north. I've never had Cricket but heard good things. There's a 3rd company called boost mobile that's pretty cheap too. 
Tmobile coverage is generally okay. I just don't like their poor coverage inside buildings or underground.

"I feel your pain - my vision is now poor enough that I have to buy the most expensive lenses to get the frame styles I want.

I know folks here love online ordering from the discount places, but I find that most of them don‚Äôt have truly poor vision and don‚Äôt wear their glasses from the time they wake up to the time they go to bed. I‚Äôve done the online ordering before and it never worked well. I usually have to take my frames in multiple times to get them adjusted (maybe I‚Äôm too picky or have an oddly shaped head) and the online retailers cannot provide that level of service.

I also have a warning about the discount online retailers - several years ago I ordered a second pair from one to have a spare and something didn‚Äôt seem right. I took it to my optometrist and the online retailer had given me the wrong lenses!

The best experience for me at the lowest price has undoubtedly been Costco. I can not recommend them enough."
"That‚Äôs just for the frames though, right? "
"Second this. I went to an ophthalmologist recently and they asked where I got my glasses, because they were surprised and the quality and thinness for my prescription."
"Nope, that‚Äôs ready to wear. "
"i have gotten 2 pairs  of glass from them over the years (and I got a pair from Target in between) and not only were they cheaper (even with insurance due to my pretty horrible vision), but their styles are way better and they have great customer service! a pair of plastic frames is like $130 for the high index and you can always try to submit the receipt to insurance if you have it. they might not be as cheap as those places with like $6 frames but you can try on the frames ahead of time and they have one of those nice 30 day return policies."
Online shopping both actual and the  ‚Äúfantasy shopping‚Äù is very helpful in curbing spending. I know not exactly frugal but I have amazon prime so when I‚Äôm running low on shampoo or toothpaste I just buy it online and it comes in two days.

"Ok here you go:

At Walmart, in the powdered drink mix section, they have one that is caffeinated. There are about five flavors, or you can get the variety pack.

There are about thirty in there for two dollars. Just mix it in your water bottle. Great value brand.

Also, if you have time, it's not hard to make an Americano or iced macchiato. Just need an espresso machine, milk, flavor coffee syrup. Takes about five minutes and it's nearly indistinguishable from Starbucks and incredibly cheaper."
"My suggestion is to train your mind that there simply isn't food for you in a convenience store. Keep almonds or something in the car. Carry a water bottle (they'll let you fill up a water bottle for free if you ask nice). Carry the powdered drink additives. Train your brain that food for YOU comes from the grocery store or your kitchen. The gas station is only for gas. Only buy gas there. 

If you're on your way home from work and it really sucks and you ate all your snacks, then stop at a grocery store and get something from a deli or whatever. 

Worst comes to worse, drive a different way to work every day so you're not passing the same store every day. Do whatever you can to break the habit of seeing the food in the gas station as ""food"" you put in your body. It's hard at first. But after a couple months you won't be in the habit anymore and you'll stop thinking of food when you pass the bright shiny lights."
"At the risk of sounding like Nancy Reagan: ""Just say no. Don't stop.'   


Don't turn your steering wheel into the store parking lot. Stopping for a 'treat' is a learned habit and learned habits can be 'unlearned'... and you can often come up with a MUCH better alternative treat that fits into your personal plans.   


Yeah - sounds simple... or over-simplified but it's kinda like a Nike commercial: ""Just Do It."" (Or in this case - ""JUST DON'T DO IT.""

Keep snacks & water in your backpack at all times for when you are hungry.  You never know when you might need them.  Zombie apocalypse Survival food!
Get some self control and personal responsibility. This is a choice you are making. You can just as easily choose to not stop.
"Buy these convenience snacks and drinks in bulk...even a grocery store price is usually cheaper than a convenience store. If you really want the thing, just price compare and have it available at home to take with you. 

Also stop drinking energy drinks. They are terrible for you. At best it‚Äôs the same as drinking a caffeinated soda...at worst it‚Äôs like drinking soda with herbs to make your heart race. Stop. 

I still have some items I grab from Costco for convenience and ease of use. Like portioned snacks or shelf stable snacks so I can make the kids think it‚Äôs a ‚Äútreat‚Äù in the car versus stopping for fast food or convenience store purchases. "

You can even bake protein bars with internet recipes."

"If it's the energy drink you want and the energy drink is the only thing you want, buy your own energy drinks. Still might not be the most effective option, but certainly cheaper to buy a case of them for at home, than getting one from the store. Then just bring it with you. Same with Slim Jims.

I do that with one kind of pop I really like -- it was adding up when I would go through the drive-thru, so I buy a small six pack (cost is less than one at the drive thru!), and then I have them at home. I still get one once in a while, but I used to stop to get them all the time."
I was addicted to energy drinks and always bought them at the gas station. Was wasting too much money so I just buy bottles of caffeine pills. $10 a month. Once you break the habit after a week or 2 it will just become routine.

"Please know I am not being a dick in saying this but I wanted to share because it worked for me. Man up. If you know you don't want to blow money at the convenience store, suck it up and keep driving. All the tips and tricks are just stupid. If you cant keep yourself from stopping at a store to buy stuff you don't need you are not in control of your own life. Use that as motivation. I realized I wasn't in control of my own life when I was going out to buy booze or nicotine when I really didn't feel like leaving the house but I felt I had to. That feeling that I was not in control was enough to make me man up and not let anything control me."
"This might seem like an odd answer, as the other comments have provided a ton of really good practical ideas, but if there is anything about the habit that is more than just convenience but coupled with lack of self control (I think we all can relate to this in at least one area of our life) I have some suggestions. If its the craving for the boost of feel good energy desired, try sleeping longer at night by incorporating a night routine, try a B-Vitamin complex (18 cents per intake). Drive a new way to work if possible. If a visual aid helps, make a sign and tape it within the car with ""You'll save $10 bucks this week or $520 this year by NOT Going to the gas station""  \~or\~ ""You're a piece of crap, even your own father doesn't respect you. Stop spending mindlessly. "" \~or\~ some other cheesy motivation quote, ya know - whatever motivates you!"
I like this idea but what if you need to get gas?
Even better; make a batch of cold brew coffee for the week and pre mix with milk and sweetener.  I‚Äôve found cold brew coffee to be the closest flavor wise to the sugary milky coffee beverages you find at convenience stores.  It doesn‚Äôt get bitter like hot coffee and stays fresh for a few weeks in the fridge.
I bought flavored coffee syrup. It's a higher price upfront but it makes me not go to Starbucks or whatever.
"Or, if it not too hot, in the car itself. "
I buy the portioned stuff at Costco as a treat. I also started packing dried fruits and a banana with me so I don't buy sweets. It's more to lose weight actually

"Don't run out of gas? It's not really that hard to keep track of such things. I also don't carry my wallet, but I'm carfree (take the bus, though I drove for years). Alternately you could get a prepaid Visa gift card with like $10 on it, for emergency gas. Or a gas station gift card. But you'd need to be strong enough not to use it on food, etc."
"Our convenience store sells gift cards and fuel (only) cards. If you get the fuel one, you won't be able to buy anything but that with it. See if they offer an only fuel card."
"Then be careful with dried fruits. Their sugar is concentrated without water, and some fruits are soaked in juices to maintain a sweet flavor. So they have more sugar than a regular serving/piece of fruit. 

And the portioned snacks keeps my kids from pigging out, too! So i can better keep track of servings for them.  "
"Gift card is a good idea. I‚Äôd probably just keep a big bill on me because I hate breaking one for change.

I drive 90 miles round trip every day so I have to fill up about every 4 days. If I didn‚Äôt have my wallet I could end up stranded. But not with that $50 laying in the glove box."
I always limit myself to 3 pieces.

Some stores will honor the sale price and give you back the difference in price.
"It's a cognitive bias we all share.  You don't remember the times that sales happened after you *didn't* buy anything, or all the times something went on sale that you didn't want.  You remember when you felt screwed.  That impact makes you remember it, and, remembering back among things worth remembering, it seems like it's the thing that always happened.  We all do it, so don't beat yourself up over it, but that's the *true* answer to the question you ask, the question of ""why does it *seem* this always happens"""

Yesterday I made a trip into town for some lumber to repair my deck. For me that meant getting gift cards from the grocery store (for the fuel discount points to use later in the month) and immediately using those gift cards for the lumber. I also had a $10 off of any $50 purchase coupon.  


Guess what I forgot to use while at the store? Yep. The coupon. I literally forgot to get $10 off my purchase.   


I had no desire to drive back into town, or worse... to go back and perhaps even be compelled go through the silliness of returning the items just to rebuy them with the coupon, so I simply called them and spoke to a customer service rep. A few minutes later she had applied the discount coupon number to my purchase over the phone & a refund popped up in my checking account the same day.  


It doesn't hurt to ask! Right?  Just make a polite inquiry and give enthusiastic thank you's for their help. Might just go a long way toward helping 'undo a snafu'."
"Some places, like Home Depot, will give you the sales price if you show them the receipt and your purchase was w/i an alotted time before the sale. "
Some credit cards offer price protection. 
It's called Murphy's Law.
"Sometimes it's targeted. I have noticed a few stores that I shop at have coupons that they give you right after you've purchased something to try get you to come back. I guess they think that shoppers who already just stocked up may not be back soon, so the coupon might get them thinking about buying more again."
"If you used a credit card, some of the issuers have price protection, where you can show them the sale price and they'll refund the difference to you"
"Yeah, depends on the stores policies. Walmart's (Canada) usually match it for... I think it is either two weeks or 30 days after purchase. Big stores will usually have it mentioned hidden away online somewhere. "
Best Buy is 7 days
"Yes, check with your credit card! You may be able to get a refund through them."
"It depends on what you‚Äôre using the air filter for! If you have allergies and want dust/dander/other air particles removed the gold standard would definitely be a HEPA filter, and those need to be changed (not terrible maybe every 6 months and you can stretch it to 12 if you vacuum it and turn it off when you plan not to be home for long periods). If you just want one to make the air not smell as bad you‚Äôll definitely have some luck finding something more affordable! 

Edit: realized I was a dummy and didn‚Äôt actually put my filter, I use a germ guardian which is normally $90 and can be found on sale occasionally for $75. "
"I have the honeywell HPA300 and HPA200. I'm not an expert or anything, but I'm pretty pleased with them and the filters definitely pick up a lot of stuff. 

They use HEPA filters that need to be replaced at least yearly, and prefilters that are supposed to last up to 3 months (they don't for us.) Generic prefilters are cheap on Amazon.

There's a lot of BS and misleading claims with air purifiers, whatever you buy make sure to research any claims they make. "
I'm using a box fan with two air filters (and cardboard triangles) attached.  I use it near it kitty litter to knock out those smells.  Works wonders.  You can make a cheap air filter with just a box fan and one house air filter taped to the back.
"I picked up one off of Amazon warehouse for a decent price. Some have washable filters. You might be able to find a used one locally also, but be prepared to wash or replace the filter in case they haven't recently. "
"Costco had one for like $99 and the air filter is removable and you just vacuum the dust/dirt out. 

It‚Äôs called TheraPure. Not sure if they still have it but I love mine!!!"
"I‚Äôm interested in reducing allergens-dust mites and dander especially. I‚Äôm willing pay for a decent one, just want to consider the cost of the filters. Yes, looking for a HEPA filter. 

You would recommend the germ guardian? Have seen that one mentioned. "
Thanks for the feedback on your purifiers! I agree...there is a lot of crap to wade through to try to find the truth. I‚Äôm feeling better now that I have some recommendations. Good to know about the prefilters. 
"Oh, great...didn't realize some have washable filters. That could be a huge savings over time. I'm going to check 'em out! Thanks for putting me on to that possibility :)."
"Cool! No Costco, but I can order through Amazon or Walmart. Glad to have a personal review.  "
"Yeah I think it‚Äôs a solid air filter, I‚Äôve had it for 3 years without any issues, changed the filter 2 times about to change it a third. So total cost after 3 years has been about $180. (Probably should have changed it a litttttle more but hey, I‚Äôm frugal? üòÇ)

The difference it makes for me is insane though, I‚Äôm deafly allergic to dust. Sneezing throughout the day at my workplace, and in most any place that hasn‚Äôt been cleaned. Having this filter has a huge effect on my room, and the entire home when I run it all day and night. "
"I ultimately replaced my Germ Guardian with a similar Holmes model and both are working great! I use it near my cat litter box and I personally stretch the filters out by hand cleaning them every couple of months so they can easily stretch up to a year.

The box fan + taped air filter on the back idea works very well for dust and particles, so it can helpful near pets just to have as an extra or even use that first. I started off with that but eventually did get a regular purifier too. If you want an immediate difference for under $30 try out the box fan + air filter setup for a couple weeks!"
"I have one, works reasonably well. In an office it won't matter, but even on low it sucks a pretty steady amount of power (40 watts IIRC). I have mine rigged up to a motion sensor in a walk-in closet with a litter box- cats trigger the sensor and the air filter will run for 10 minutes, then shut off. Takes care of all the odors as well, thanks to the activated charcoal."
I really appreciate your reply! I think it‚Äôs going to be well worth the $. 
"Was there a reason you went with Holmes? Any difference? 

Thanks so much for the reply. "

I think my kids let them turn brown because they prefer what happens next - banana smoothies and banana bread. Your little dude could be intelligent way beyond his 18 months.

"I‚Äôm like that with orange juice - love to drink it at restaurants, at others peoples houses but I *hate* drinking it at home. Legitimately tastes different even if it‚Äôs the same brand- and I‚Äôm 18"
"It's one banana Michael. What could it cost, ten dollars?"
"My son used to only eat the deli meat when they gave the sample slice or he would eat slices from the bag I ordered as walked around the store. Once we got home, nothing. Not even a bite. I started buying a half a loaf of fresh five grain bread from the bakery section, a quarter pound of chicken or turkey from the deli and feed him a ""deconstructed sandwich"" as we waltzed around the store in order for him to eat a healthy lunch. 

Ah, motherhood. "
"If it comes in a Costco sample paper cup, it is made of candy and rainbows. Bring that shit home and it becomes, well, shit. "
It's like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich at the beach. It just tastes better *there*.
"Our toddler would only eat bananas when my husband would peel the banana, place it on the counter and say, ""Don't eat my banana.""  Kid thought it was hilarious to gobble it down. (We thought it was hilarious, too. ;)"
Mine only eats apples while in the cart at the grocery store. Apples at home don‚Äôt taste as good...
For an 18 month old you could try giving him the banana sliced. It's messier tho
Does he have other options at home?
"Oh, Giant. How I love thee. :)"
In NYC we have Free Summer Meals for kids under 18y/o. Most days these are cold ham and cheese sandwiches. My son loves ‚Äúfree food sandwiches‚Äù but if we make the same thing at home we won‚Äôt touch it. 
"I'm sorry for having to ask, but what is Giant???"
My five year old has eaten a banana I purchased maybe once every six months since he began eating solids. He eats banana with gusto and begs for more when we visit other people. I figured out why he always wants to buy them when we shop for food though - he really loves making (and eating) banana bread. It's a long game for a five year old.... 
"My bf does the same any time he buys them when we shop they go uneaten, but he will eat a gas station banana all the time. Nobody else in the house eats them so I say dont get them, he is always gonna eat them this time. Good thing I like banana bread."
"My niece got an American girl doll for her birthday from the other side of the family, the first thing she shouted was ""Oh my God do you have any idea how much these things cost!""

5 years old."
My kids do this all the time with free fruit. They are also big fans of only eating certain things if it is my dinner. I don‚Äôt get it... all food is free for them.
"Went to my parents house. Our picky 20 month old ate the green beans out of grandpa's garden. Ate 5 in total. Bought some from the store and she took a bite and then spit them out :(

"
[Free bananas!](https://youtu.be/XuzPM7A7UUo)
They are associating fruit and the grocery stores.  
"You should offer him a frozen banana now at home, he might want a regular banana when shopping later"
"You aren't providing him with ""special"" bananas. You're a silly mom. Just ask him ;)
"
"My daughter is the same! In tesco (UK), she'll eat the free apples whole. At home, she won't touch it if it's not peeled and chopped up. "
Maybe the bananas they give for free is tastier because they add something to it.
"My son is the same! Toddler playgroup oranges ""yes please!"" add in a bit of mum pride that my kid is eating orange and not just bread sticks.
At home the snacks are Kinder Eggs or Hell on a stick. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
My kids will ONLY eat bananas that my mother tries to eat herself I swear to God. 
Your kid will be an accountant
"In that case I don't offer a banana,I have one myself in front of toddler. Toddler then asks for one"
Freeze your bananas.. then add your left over yoghurt and blend till you get a nice smoothie! Kids love it!
"When I was little I only drank water from drinking fountains, but never from a water bottle or cup.

Kids are weird."
"Mine used to do this with pretzle sticks.  They wouldn't touch them at home,  but if their pediatrician handed them one it was like they had just entered a candy store. "
You should stop making him pay for home bananas.  Most 18 month olds have very low cash flow.
First they create the buttons and then they take great joy in pushing it endlessly. 
We have to get up at 6am tomorrow to drive all day to the beach. Of course my 9 month old woke up at 1am and was ready to party. 
"""yummy, I really like these""

Buy a big box of it

""Yuck, I don't like those""

"
Maybe some fancy fruit displays at home might help? Haha
Kids are weird. 
"This is how you create fussy eaters. 

Kids won't starve themselves and will eat eventually so, just keep giving them the same thing they wouldn't eat previously until they do. The behavior stops pretty quickly when you do that.

Also, careful that it's not allergies though, many of the things I was supposedly fussy about eating when I was little are things I am allergic to.

Source: Fussy eater with a ton of food allergies that raised 2 non fussy eating kids that ended up foodies that watch way too many food shows but I digress... "
It's a monkey thing.  Very useful when they're learning to forage but their pattern-recognition isn't so good.
"My little cousin used to love those easy made macaroni boxes, but only if daddy made them. If my aunt tried to make it she would refuse. She was so picky..."
My middle child won't touch a lot of new stuff at home. At Costco? He'll eat every single sample no matter how exotic. 
When I was a toddler I would only take medicine if I was at daycare. That was awful for my parents.
Glad I am not the only one. I just can't begin to understand why.
Free always tastes better. I am always more excited about the items I get for free while couponing over the other items. 
"To the kid, every banana is free."
This is a very sweet memory and a very handy tip for my toddler who loves chopsticks! 
"OMG I forgot about Sagwa! I used to actually like that show, despite being way too old for it."
Chopsticks at 3 is impressive and great practice. What is Sagwa? 
Sagwa! I loved that show!!
We went to aldi the other day and he cried the whole time. We had bananas in the cart and he didn't get to eat one. I hope he doesn't associate all grocery stores with free bananas. 
"Relevant _Office_ clip:

https://youtu.be/7GrDoEvG4t4?t=5"
"Keep small box, buy big box, hide big box and repeatedly refill small box?"
Maybe that is what he is waiting for. I haven't made banana pancakes or banana muffins in awhile. Perhaps I should. 
And then you get banana all over the car. Or at least my toddler would get banana all over the car. Mine seems to take great joy in making car snacks go everywhere. 
"I hated garlic and onions as a kids, at 30 I discovered that I‚Äôm actually allergic to them."
Banana store. Love it. 
So true. They are always showing off somehow in public. 
"I also like to rip them into little chunks. Bananas seem to naturally want to split into thirds, then I rip chunks off of each third of the  banana.

My daughter eats A LOT of bananas."
One time he broke the banana apart and smeared it all over the table. That was fun. 
Yes. He's just not much of a fruit eater. Apples are a favorite. I just always hope that since he eats them in the store he might eat them at home. 
"Grocer in the northeast. Giant, Giant Food, Giant & Martin's, Martin's, Stop and Shop. Functions in Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, and West Virginia. Corporation is called Ahold, a denmark or belgium based company.

The holy grail of little girl toys! Either she really understand money or has heard people say that a lot. Bet she was happy though. 
That is a good idea since it might also help with the molars. 
"If only kinder eggs weren't so dangerous we could have real ones in the US. /s

What is Hell on a stick? "
Sounds about right. 
I hate bananas. That does work with many other foods for him.
">When I was little...

*last week*"
If there was anything that I wish kids could do is allow their parents to sleep. I‚Äôm not the greatest parent when I‚Äôm sitting on 3-4 hours of sleep. 
"Yawn. With a 9 month old at least you know it‚Äôs not because you did anything: sometimes babies are up at night.

When my kiddo was 4 or 5 we made the mistake of telling him we needed to get up ‚Äúearly, when it was dark‚Äù to leave for vacation. We meant 5:30 am. He woke at 3 am. We ended up leaving the house super early and driving mostly in the dark, but hey, we made it to our destination early.  It was easier than getting an excited kid back to sleep (and of course he slept in the car). His parents were a wee bit tired that first day of vacation. "
"Tbh, this is why I only buy things that I know I'm going to like. With a toddler, I can usually distract him enough away from something he's pointing at (granted, he's only 17 months) that he'll forget about it shortly. And, if I can't, then at least I know I or my husband will enjoy it, even if he doesn't eat it."

"Judging by eating habits, apparently they're really cats in disguise."
"Yeah ... have you heard where they COME FROM?!?! 

Ewwwww!"
"Everyone told me that with my oldest, he will eat when he gets hungry enough. Nope, that kid will wait me out and has done it before. You can‚Äôt literally let your kid starve, and when you have a stubborn one they will push you to the limits. 

I make him try something new 3 different times (small portion) and if he still doesn‚Äôt like it then I tell him he doesn‚Äôt have to try it again for a few years (he is 10 now and has started to like things he didn‚Äôt like when he was younger). It‚Äôs not worth it to make him have a life long hate of certain things. Different people have different taste preferences, even kids. I personally would starve to death before I ate ketchup! "
You can‚Äôt give that much parenting advice based on a single anecdote.  Seriously chill out 
">Kids won't starve themselves 

Yes they will. Maybe not to death, but certainly to a point where it'd be worse to let them continue to starve than to give in. I was that kid. I was underweight and had a rather limited diet of things I would eat. I as I got older and learned to cook, I began to experiment more, and now eat a wide variety of foods. Still won't touch eggs, though. Gross.

"
"Yeah, my family tried this with me and I ended up needing hospital treatment for malnutrition. I had sensory issues around chewing/swallowing and was horrifically afraid of choking so basically anything that wasn't pureed and bland I wouldn't eat until I was nearly 10. Eventually they decided to just feed me tiny portions of the things I was comfortable with and the tiniest taste/lick/bite of a new food until both my appetite and my issues stopped being a thing."
"I'm actually working on this, but some days I'm too exhausted to fight. I do need to be more consistent though. "
"Yeah- it is annoying when people tell me and my wife how lucky we are that our son is such a good eater. It isn‚Äôt luck! It is hard work, and we spend a lot of time feeling like we are just being assholes to him. 

We refuse to make him a ‚Äòkids‚Äô option; he eats what the grownups eat. 

It isn‚Äôt easy at all, but it is worth it. And it gets easier every day, now that we have established that we are as stubborn as him. He obviously loves comfort food like pizza and mac & cheese like every kid, but he actually really appreciates them because they are kind of rare treats for him.

And there is nothing better than the people‚Äôs reaction when a 3-year-old  pushes ketchup out of the way and asks for ‚Äòriracha."
"I think it‚Äôs mental, honestly. I can drink tea at work without sugar and it‚Äôs fine, but if I drink that same tea, at home, prepared the same way... gotta have sugar. "
"Put one in front of him, and then say ""Oops! Nope. That one is too expensive."" and whisk it away. "
I would think it has to do with the atmosphere of the space the child is in
I remember shopping as a kid being so boring it felt like an eternity - this all makes sense to me as an adult who despises Melons but forced myself to eat a melon platter on an international flight to help break up the 21 hours of travel
"I loved it too, even though there's a huge age gap between my sister and I haha. Even when I was little though, I always hated Caillou"
"Sagwa was a kid show about a cat in ancient China, so my sister would love to ""use"" chopsticks while watching it. Playing pretend was the best way to get her to eat. She had no clue how to handle chopsticks so she'd ask for a fork and tell me to pretend it was chopsticks haha."
"oh, you're paying for them ...and so are we :("
"Ha! Maybe. You wanna know what else? I‚Äôll finally give and donate the large box somewhere. Couple months later I‚Äôll buy the small box f t myself thinking ‚ÄòHey, here‚Äôs a snack they don‚Äôt want and I can count on grabbing one for work‚Äô Go to grab one for work on day 2 and they‚Äôre gone again. Lol"
"Haha yes, this is true."
"I liked tomatoes off and on when I was younger.  I had tomatoes when I was 13ish then I broke out all over, apparently puberty can activate food allergies."
When my toddler breaks a banana he wants me to fix it....
Drop the other options and he'll probably eat fruit more at home.
Hah! Sorry! I was using it in the same way you might say Hell let loose or basically a massive tantrum. I think only me and my family say Hell on a stick üò≥
You can always pretend eat fro a bowl with a spoon ;)
But how will they foster Stockholm syndrome if they don't keep us up randomly? It's already hard enough that they have to be both bad cop and good cop. 
I think I got the toddler lottery. My 2 year old will sleep until noon if I let her
It's the only available stimulus he's allowed to touch. of course its his focus there.
Staaaahp. You're making me crave a banana. 
A E S T H E T I C
That comment actually made me laugh at loud. Now I am mentally comparing my toddler to our three cats and the list keeps growing. 
"I can confirm this. My son (2.5 years old) will ask for more food, even though there is already some on his plate. You just have to move it around to fill in the blank spot. Just like a cat. "
Why ewww? Storks seems very nice. 
"What is the maximum time you can have a standoff until you gotta cave and feed the kid? No kids yet, just curious. "
"Same here with our 8 year old. He literally gags on most food we try with him and we've tried eeeeverything. We've tried ""starving"" him and he's fine with just not eating for as long as it would be safe not to have food.

Fortunately he'll eat lots of vegetables (raw) and fruit but he's really limited on entree/meal type of foods. We think it's a sensory/texture thing more than taste. Hoping he grows out of it and we'll keep trying."
">asks for 'riracha 

Omg that's so fucking cute "
"That's how my parents did with avocados. They were very expensive in the 90's, though. "
Best advice so far
"Fuck Caillou, my daughter has never watched it and I refuse to introduce it to her. Bald little whiny bitch brat. 

I have strong feelings about Caillou lol."

"Aw man they have trainer chopsticks that are attached at the top like tongs that are meant for kids who need to learn. They‚Äôre really helpful, I got my partner a frog themed pair since he didn‚Äôt know how to use them until it clicked with his practice pair. We later let his 12 year old brother use them and he got the hang of it quick. 

It‚Äôs probably too late for her but I guess for anyone else who doesn‚Äôt know, trainer chopsticks are pretty neat!"
"Oh my gosh... that cat show I couldn't think of the name !!!!! 
Thank you! "
Ha! The scarcity must be what makes them so delicious. 
This is how I got myself to eat my fruits and veggies in my 30s.

"Mine would sleep til noon Monday thru Friday, but wants to get up at 5 am Saturday and Sunday."
Mine reminds me of the dog he picked out. Both push my buttons in the same way too. 
"Yep, gotta be in ‚Äòpiles‚Äô or ‚Äòlines‚Äô like coke. Haha. Only when he‚Äôs had some already and needs to finish."
This made me laugh.
That was cute ‚ô°
But stork vaginas must be so small... 
"Depends on their behavior lately & how much you love them.... kidding!!!! 

Depends on the kid. My kids has always been small for his age and underweight so him missing meals was not a great choice in our eyes. We tried it once or twice thinking he would cave in, and didn‚Äôt let him have dessert or fun snacks (like chips or fruit snacks) he could only have a healthy snack like a fruit or veggie or milk before bed. 

I read an article when he was about 3 that was overall dumb about letting kids choose everything but it made a good point: as an adult, if we aren‚Äôt hungry we don‚Äôt eat, if we get full we stop (sometimes), if we hate something we don‚Äôt eat it/don‚Äôt make it. Kids don‚Äôt have to dictate everything, but I remember doing the sit at the table until you eat it (I lasted over 6 hours once for some disgusting eggplant shit my mom made) and now I can‚Äôt even smell ketchup without barfing (it was eggplant Parmesan and she didn‚Äôt have tomato sauce so she thought ketchup was close enough). Now I give my kid appropriate choices for dinner that I know he will eat and when he complains I tell him that he chose it so he will eat it + he gets a few bites of what we are having. He went from not eating any meat except hot dogs to now loving bacon, taco meat, turkey taco meat, chili, & will ask for small portions of eggs and pork tenderloin because we dint make him eat it or force him until it made him sick and he got to ‚Äúchoose‚Äù to like it. 

Every kid is different. I swear I need artwork in my home that says if you are hungry enough for dessert, you are hungry enough to eat your dinner!

You might want to do some research into ARFID. Kids with arfid don‚Äôt necessarily just grow out of it and need professional help to learn to overcome the sensory issues and fear to learn to eat a wider range of foods.
I always wonder if people in other cultures struggle with this too or if it‚Äôs just a North American thing. And if it IS just a North America thing then what the heck is going on??? Why are so many kids so impossibly picky? 
It sounds like a sensory thing for sure. If it is really limiting his eating you might look into feed therapy. They break down eating foods into a process to help someone overcome the fear/sensory issue with eating certain foods. 
"Omg same!!!! Mine has been a great healthy eater: fruits, veggies, cheese - just no meat. He did the same thing from age 4 until last year when we started him on ADHD meds (not saying your kid has ADHD, just noticed some of the sensory things in our child have decreased). Gags. Throws up. Same for haircuts and tags or embroidery on clothes. 

Apparently a lot of kids have sensory issues with textures or can‚Äôt chew them up properly so they don‚Äôt ‚Äúlike‚Äù them. 

We tried everything getting him to eat meats and other foods, but that kid has a palate like Gordon Ramsay and can detect finely ground meat in spaghetti sauce and ‚Äúwhite broccoli‚Äù (cauliflower) in those nuggets by green giant among other things. He is just very sensitive to tastes/textures so I just make him try a bite or two 3 times total and then I tell him I won‚Äôt bother him again until his ‚Äútaste buds change‚Äù in a couple years. "
You might listen to [this](http://think.kera.org/2015/06/18/beyond-picky-eating/) interview from public radio. She made some really good points and certainly can't hurt to have some new tools to try out. Good luck! 
Now they cost as much as housing!
Still are here in Australia. 
I have heard terrible things about it. I can only hope he never sees it somewhere else because it isnt happening in my house. We are a Daniel tiger family. 
Ya don't say lol
I‚Äôve taken to putting 1 for each kid out at a time and hiding the box just to see. 
"Solid reply. Was genuinely curious because my older brother has always been an annoyingly picky eater and I want to make sure I do not end up with a child like that. I have honestly never seen the guy eat any ""vegetable"" except for mashed potatoes or corn on the cob. My mom used to just cook us hamburger helper all the time cuz that's all the fucker would eat. Luckily my best friend's family ate regular people food, so I can thank them for introducing me to many different foods. He's skinny fat, but thinks he's okay cuz he's not obese. I know life is unpredictable, but I'm very fitness focused and I just want to set my hypothetical family up with good healthy habits to last a lifetime, ya know?"
"Thanks for that. I've seen arfid before but just lost track of it and couldn't remember what it was to ask his doctor. He does suffer from anxiety (in general) and his doctor has said he's probably juuuust off the autism spectrum -potentially Asperger's or something milder.

We aren't pushing the matter but my wife, in particular, isn't shy about getting help/services."
"I've been in a Cambodian orphanage before that basically served fish and rice every day, and there were 2 kids who would refuse to eat fish or wouldn't eat rice if anything was touching it. I don't think it's just North American kids."
For sure it‚Äôs also an Asian thing. I have many Asian friends who hate carrots when they grew up!
"Yep ADHD also. He's ok with haircuts but he went through a phase where shirt tags had to be cut off. The only meat he will have is pepperoni (cooked on pizza) and he'll eat mcnuggets (no other chicken nuggets or strips). PB & J is how he gets most of his protein. He used to eat a variety pack of cheese slices but now it's mostly only American on grilled cheese that he'll eat. 

He doesn't have the same palate detective skills but he doesn't eat much that we could slip other stuff into it (nothing with sauces etc.)  Come to think if it, I'm sure I could slip some cheddar in his grilled cheese and he'd eat it. I'll have to try that.

Lots of quirks and little things... each one isn't a big deal but they do add up to a challenge."
"> He did the same thing from age 4 until last year when we started him on ADHD meds (not saying your kid has ADHD, just noticed some of the sensory things in our child have decreased). Gags. Throws up. Same for haircuts and tags or embroidery on clothes.

This was me. My mother tried, forced, screamed, and begged me to eat a bigger variety, but if something I couldn't stand was in front of me all she got was vomit. I wouldn't put up with wearing ""uncomfortable"" clothes because they made me feel sick. 

As an adult though, I trained myself to eat different foods because I was bored and I *wanted* to eat more than what I was used to. It took a solid decade but I'm at a point where I'll just try to eat what is in front of me even if an ingredient is new or previously unliked. 

So maybe when he gets older you'll have better luck in the food arena. Reading about parents that really try for their ADHD kids warms my heart though. I'm so glad some people want to understand their kid with all their ""quirks""."

Haha I love it. How has that worked so far?
"Kids have their own personalities. You can‚Äôt change some things, and when you think you can you are in for a wonderful surprise. If you do have kids, expose them to flavors and spices at a young age. Don‚Äôt feed them ghost peppers at 3 months, but don‚Äôt think that little ones don‚Äôt like flavor. 

I made my own baby food for my younger son (older one is step son, lived with me and husband since age 3) and I made him food I would want to eat. Sweet potatoes with some cinnamon, black beans with lime juice and cumin etc, guacamole. Freeze in ice cube trays and transfer frozen chunks to ziploc bags for easy portions. Although, disclaimer: do not feed them stuff you don‚Äôt want to share. I now have to buy 3 portions of salmon so my little man can have a whole salmon fillet for himself lol

I love how you say ‚Äúregular people food‚Äù ... my mom never learned to cook so all we did was go out to eat or eat shit burnt disgusting food. So learn how to make easy simple dishes! "
"Not a psychologist, but my understanding is that the latest edition of the DSM removed Aspergers as a diagnosis, and now it's just lumped in the autism spectrum"
"I‚Äôve found that if we aren‚Äôt pushy, he is more open to trying things. Especially when it can be served in conjunction with a vessel (like on a tortilla chip or try a piece of egg on your bacon sandwich). 

Also, some of it is just taste bud sensitivity! Some people are ‚Äúsuper tasters‚Äù and can taste components the regular population can‚Äôt taste + I think we as adults forget how sensitive some kids palates can be to bitter flavors or flavor overload in general.

I have 10 yr old who is super ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù eater (he specifically requested we stop calling him picky so we have changed our verbiage) who likes bland, plain food and a 3 yr old who loves spicy salsa, sour Mexican black beans, salmon, asparagus, etc. Some of it is just the person! 

Our parents were raised by the depression era/ war era babies whose parents didn‚Äôt waste anything so we were the ones sitting down to meals we hated eating stuff we hated and may still find unpalatable. My kids don‚Äôt run my life, but it‚Äôs important for me to talk to my older one and let him make small choices about what he wants to eat. It‚Äôs hard to think of your kid as having different tastes than you, but think back to that favorite meal of your parents that you hated! "
"He will notice! Worth a try and then just deny and say it‚Äôs the same as always! Our doctor said that ADHD can make them overly sensitive and we should be appropriately more understanding, which makes sense ‚Äî-I am still cutting tags out of shorts even though he wears boxers and shouldn‚Äôt even be able to feel them! 

I about lost my mind when he was in preschool and his teacher told me that PB has enough protein and it will be fine!!! Per the pediatrician we have drinking carnation instant breakfast (the full fat ones) at night to add in extra calories and protein. He uses my husband‚Äôs protein shaker drink cups so he thinks it‚Äôs cool! "
Holy fuck I have ADHD and haaaaated haircuts until I was like 14-15... like couldn't sit still. 
"Thank you for giving me hope for the future!!! I don‚Äôt want him to be the adult that has to eat off the kids menu forever (but I guess there are worse thing he could go grow up to do). Hopefully he will continue to try new things because he is ready to. How did you train yourself to eat new things? Any special tips or tricks?

And thank you for the insight into the clothing. I can understand wearing something uncomfortable or itchy but I was always able to deal with it, your explanation makes a lot of sense. I will definitely try to be a lot more patient and understanding with him, even when I think he is over reacting. I love getting all these tips and tricks and secrets!!!!! "
It's Winter so I haven't looked but enough that I only have it when I'm flush with money
"I have to pick which one of my kids I like least and sell them on Etsy, to afford smashed avo on toast.

Ok, that's only a slight exaggeration."

Awww you are such a wonderful mom
"I was a sickly kid so I understand needing nutrition shakes to stay balanced.  I‚Äôm an adult and the only issues I have are meat (texture) and tomatoes (developed an allergy during puberty).

Maybe look into veggie burgers for protein?  There are a lot of smoothie recipes out there that have yogurt (calcium, protein) and fruits and veggies in them as well.  When making milkshakes use frozen bananas instead of ice cream, that‚Äôll give you some extra vitamins."
"I know this sounds useless, but other than will and preparing myself to try one new ingredient every time I could stand to, I didn't have any other plan. I'm sure a specialist in nutrition or child ADHD probably has better ideas. The thought process was more: ""Okay, do I actually hate black beans or does something about them bother me? Just try ONE of them and figure it out. Oh, not so bad the texture is kind of gross like this, maybe I'd like it if I put it in ____ dish first."" Then experimentation until I found a way to eat it. 

It has worked relatively well, I used to be stuck with like 3 vegetables, meat, noodles, like 2 breads, and mild cheese and now like I said I can find something to eat in every meal I make/get.  Admittedly, aging also helped with the overly intense ""bitter"" taste I got with almost every food as a kid. 

Having a spouse that is okay with gently reminding me that I should try something is a plus. If he orders something I haven't had yet he'll offer a bit and if it's a ""nope, can't handle any of that new stimulation crap today"" day, he will leave it alone and just let me eat. I feel safer sharing my problem and being supported is just awesome."
I checked out this site: http://www.avocado.org.au/our-programs/supply-chain-data/retail-pricing/ and it looks like the prices are about the same in Australia as here in Sweden today. They were A LOT more expensive back then in the early nighties. üòÜ
Thank you! This means more than you will ever know! What a great message to wake up to!

I am hoping one day he gets to a point like you - where he can go pretty much any where and find at least 1 thing he will eat (even if it‚Äôs only a side dish or bread & butter lol) I never realized it could be an issue of new stimulation, that explains a lot - like why he is always adamant about never branching out or trying something new at family get togethers where there are a lot of people!!!

Bought a Costco Membership, and I've been using their instacart delivery option. They do build in markups (about 25&#37;) but I don't have a car and its worth it to me to pay 25&#37; to save the time and effort that taking the bus and hauling back groceries would entail.

"> The plan is, I have enough savings to prove to the landlord that if someone doesn't have rent, I can pay their rent. I would want them to be evicted and replaced if that happens, but that means that while I take the financial blow  
  
You do know eviction can take months right? Are you prepared to pay 6 months rent and any damages from when they smash shit and leave?This does not even include court filing costs ect. Because if you contract is written to say you will cover cost of eviction it may cost you thousands."
"I used Zillow to find mine. Each place will require different things as far as deposit and credit and what not and will depend on the owner. It‚Äôs not uncommon at all to find houses to rent.

As far as people on the lease they will most likely want everyone that‚Äôs living in the house to be on the lease, but I suppose you may get lucky with a lazy owner."
"Sounds like you‚Äôre ready to take on a lot of financial responsibilities for others.  If you can seriously afford a home, I‚Äôd consider that option and look into it more.  Even if it‚Äôs a townhouse to start. Get something newer that doesn‚Äôt require a lot of work.  And yes, have roommates that pay into your mortgage.  "
Facebook Marketplace has listings and so will local newspapers and circulars and I think Craigslist. 
"Where do you live? In a college town, almost everybody rents houses "
"You renting and then letting other people rent from you is totally legal. It's called subletting, and every lease I've signed prohibited it. Some also prohibited dog ownership, which is also legal but increases the landlord's risks. You can ask actual landlords at r/landlord"
"Yeah if it dragged out like that t wouldn't be worth it, so I won't claim responsibility for the room mates.

The reason I came to that thought is, I feel like owners would be turned off by four twenty year olds wanting to rent, and I could increase my chances by lessening their worries."
"Okay thanks, having everyone on the lease seems like a good idea. And if someone doesn't pay rent, most lease agreements generally say that the others under the lease have to cover the cost right?"
"Oh cool I didn't think about looking at Facebook. Thanks! 

When I view a house I will potentially be renting, should I make all the others come with me? Everyone has a different schedule so that may be impossible."

"The joint lease DOES mean you are all on the hook for one another.

In an appt I had, a roommate went cokehead with his new cokehead girlfriend. Fucked up their room and skipped town before the lease was up. My girlfriend and I were left holding the bag.

How you get a house as 4 twenty-somethings is you all have decent credit and no criminal records. A large security deposit helps too."
"Search around, me and 2 others rented a whole house for 2yrs at a younger age than you.  
  
Also, how is it illegal to rent the house and subrent the rooms?  That's legal in almost any jurisdiction,  i know in my province you have a right to sublet.  In my ideal world you should be able to profit off sublets if you want, free market and all, but most jurisdictions you can't make more than the cost of agreed rent between you and landlord.  
  
In arizona they're not required to let you sublet, but they CAN if they want to, so bring it up if you feel that'd be an easier path (hint, probably isn't)"
"Generally, the rent amount has to be paid to the landlord by a certain day each month. Who provides the money or where it comes from isn‚Äôt really the issue here. You can‚Äôt enter a lease as 4 people and then insist that only 1 of you is at fault because 3 of you paid your shares. You are basically one entity to the landlord and if the rent isn‚Äôt paid, all of you are at fault. He won‚Äôt just evict one person ‚Äî he will evict ALL of you. 

It‚Äôs great and mature of you to be prepared to cover someone‚Äôs rent, but it would be more mature of you to consider your roommates and finances more carefully, instead. If you don‚Äôt really know some of the people and aren‚Äôt sure of their reliability or trustworthiness, maybe find other roommates. 

Might also consider asking in the legal subreddits if anyone knows of some docs you guys can all sign that hold everyone on the lease liable for their shares. So that if you need to go after someone, you at least have a legal document to present in court to try and get your rent money back. 

That‚Äôs worst case scenario, of course. Hopefully this will all turn out fine for you, instead. Wear clean clothes and be respectful and polite when touring the house and you won‚Äôt have to feel like you are a less-than-ideal candidate to lease a house just because you‚Äôre 20! The fact that you came here to ask for advice already shows that you are more mature than some people out there twice your age!

Good luck!"
"Not necessarily, in my house I‚Äôm the one who pays rent and I‚Äôm responsible for collecting from my roommates. I‚Äôm not sure how the landlord would handle it if my roommates couldn‚Äôt make rent. It‚Äôs likely they would come after me for rent and then I would have to go after my roommates in court or something. However they are pretty good at paying rent so that hasn‚Äôt happened. "
"I didnt read your post, I have no advice on that. "
"Awesome thank you for the info! Yeah I meant I won't take ""sole"" responsibibility like I planned. Do you know if the security deposit is one large sum that is held, and won't be retuned if one ""spoils the lunch"" or does each person have a separate deposit that they are responsible for?

This is probably where the lease agreements tend to differ from one another."
"> Also, how is it illegal to rent the house and subrent the rooms?

that will be spelled out in the lease. if your lease doesn't allow sublets ... "
"Oh wow thank you for all the help! 
Yeah finding reliable responsible people has been the hardest part (and the only part lol) so far. I had the group ready, and everyone sent me their credit. But one guy took two weeks of me asking every day before he sent me it. His credit was like 540 I was pissed. Huge red flag.

Then when we went to see a viewing of a house, he showed up with a backwards hat, with a hole in the brim, skinny jeans that had holes exposing his entire kneecaps, and a canes chicken shirt on. Needless to say he got replaced lol.

Have a good one!
"
Lmao!!!!! Well thanks haha
"Typically there will be a single, large security deposit, for the lease. Any amount of that deposit will be held for damages beyond normal wear and tear. 
Renting in your 20s is easier if you look for houses owned by private people, aka not a property management company. Also, having good credit, no criminal records, jobs, and showing up to tours/meetings looking professional helps. 
My fiance and I just went through this after moving to Arizona a few months ago. "
"Think of it as the landlord holding your money hostage.

If you behave, you get it back.

If you don't, then you lose it and the landlord has some money to fix whatever you broke.

Higher risk means a larger deposit, and young people are considered higher risk.

One thing someone else pointed out is rent from the owner, not a management company. Absolutely do this, a company will see you as very high risk because they rent to many more people than an owner and they are biased by how many bad experiences they have. They also do shady shit like fees and partially refundable deposits, eg: a $2,000 deposit but they keep $500 as a 'management fee' or 'holding fee'."

"Check if your local area has any gardening organizations. People who are into that oven love sharing it (both advice and plants)! Also is there a nearby university that has an extension service?

All seeds can be put in the freezer and will keep viable for 3-5 years. Buy them at the end of the season when on sale. They all have the pack date so you can tell how old they are. Put inside a large yogurt container and pop in the freezer still next spring. Also planting perennials means they come back year after year.
"I went to Lowe's last week and they had a bunch of their pretty flowers on sale for 50% off. Some of them were even perennials that came with their guarantee for a refund if they don't come back up next year. I got a large fox glove for $4. I've been wanting one for years but could never warrant spending $16+ on a plant and I couldn't get them to grow from seeds.

For the next year various herbs and veggies from seeds is a great way to grow a lot for cheap. Lettuces, spinach, and kale grow surprisingly well from seeds and usually once big enough you can harvest a few leaves and let the rest of the plant keep growing. My favorite is saving the seeds from the mini bell peppers from the store and planting those, they grow so well and produce a lot of peppers for a little plant. For tomatoes I'll just plant whole slices of whatever variety (except heirlooms, those won't grow). Tomato seeds seem to grow better in their own rot and also won't sprout until the soil temperature is 70-80 degrees. Mostly I'd say just have some fun with it. You can probably find some seed packs on sale now or soon and just save them in a dry, dark place for next year. If you have any questions about seedlings let me know, I had to come up with some creative solutions living in an apartment and only container gardening on a deck."

"How do you save the seeds from the mini peppers, do you have to do anything special once you remove them? Because I love those, and I'd absolutely love to plant some of those next year. My grandpa grows his own hybrid tomatoes, so I'll probably grow from his seeds next year if I can (of even grab a sprout or two from him if he'll let me). I'll definitely come back to you if I have any questions, I'm about to start trying to grow some carrots and broccoli and peas from seeds (some charts I was directed to tell me if I start like literally right now I still have time).

That's great advice about Lowe's, I'll have to go around and check out the gardening departments of a few different places to see what might be on sale, maybe I can pick up some nice perennials and get a head start on next year."
"Nope sorry, to clarify, in most grow zones, peas can be grown both early spring to early summer, and from late summer to first frost. I'm currently seeding snow peas, but you can do any kind of pea. 

Google ""your city + grow zone"" to find out your grow zone, then google ""your grow zone + seed starting chart"" to find something like this https://d1nw62gticy6e9.cloudfront.net/uploads/Planting-Zone-6.jpg

Nothing too special. I just place the seeds on a paper towel until dry (about 24 hours) and then put them in a ziplock bag until ready for use. I've stored them for over a year and still had strong plants grow.
Wait wait wait... you‚Äôre telling me it‚Äôs not too late to grow my own snow peas??! Would sugar snap work too? Those are my favorite and they‚Äôre stupid expensive.

I keep copy/pasted book descriptions to save time, and check my inventory weekly to see where I can improve my pricing.

Amazon shipping is a rip-off and you‚Äôre going to be better off shipping them independently, just to add a little more profit.

"It's incredibly time consuming.  I work in book retail, an we have an entire division of our company dedicated to just internet sales.  Granted our collection is upwards of 3 million items, I'm sure you won't need an entire team of people, but you should expect to make listing books a full time job for a while.  And even when you have them all listed, there's no guarantee anyone is ever even going to buy them.  You could sit on all of these listings for months until someone bites.  If you're strapped for cash and you're just looking for a quick buck, itemizing and pricing by item is not the way to go, you should look into selling in bulk.  If you're just doing this as a side hustle while you work a more traditional job, you may never find the time to make any money off of it."
"I‚Äôve had listings up before and even forgotten I had something listed when it finally sold. It costs time to inventory and update...and I ship media mail.

Buy a huge plastic cola bottle made for coins (it is about 2 foot tall). I did that in college. I didn‚Äôt cash it in until it was full. It was over 400 bucks :) 
"My 2 college roommates and I always saw random change when we lived in the city. One day, we saw a dollar on the floor of the subway car, and one of us picked it up. We decided to pick up every coin/bill that we saw, regardless of value. After one semester, we had $84 (and $11 on a Starbucks card, and I think a $10 iTunes gift card). "
"We call this 'stupid money'. Invariably it's just change from the bottom of the purse, pockets, backpack, behind the seats... theoretically we should use it for something stupid but most of the time it's still used for 'real' stuff."
"This is approximately $85 in change saved up over two years. I rarely use cash, so this is mostly laundromat and car wash leftovers.


I never missed any of this money when I didn't spend it, but today it will go into my savings account where it will draw interest for some time to come!"

You should see if you get lucky and try to find something worth more than face value. I made a [list](https://www.reddit.com/r/coins/comments/18eos2/a_complete_list_of_us_and_canadian_coins_to_look/) over at /r/coins to help people out.

This is exactly why I love saving change. Congrats!!
Is it sad I‚Äôm genuinely looking forward to counting my coins once mines is full. It‚Äôs one of those giant Jack Daniels piggy banks and it‚Äôs only about a third of the way full! 
"I once saved 395 dollars over 2 years when I was in middle school. Granted my dad would always give me his change.. I kept the change in pickle jars, it was great. I'm 27 now and I aim to use cash more often so I can save coins. I love having a bit extra when u need it or for spending money on vacay. It's great!"

A lot of insurance companies have an after hour number you could try that and see what they say
I'm pretty sure you should be able to reach your insurance company even though it's no longer within normal business hours. I've been able to reach mine in the evening in the past.. You really should talk to them before renting a car
"talk to your insurance, call them, and tell them what you need."
Try to contact someone at your insurance - do they have a 24 hour phone line?  Are there live reps on the web?  
"I mean is it your only mode of transportation? If you need a car for life get a car. It is just money. 

Also was in a pretty rough accident recently hope you are ok. "
"If you don't mind sharing, what insurance company do you have? A weekend without or at least with questions regarding transportation seems to be at least one of the things customers are insuring against!"
Your insurance company should retroactively cover the rental car. They will most likely cut you a check and take over the rental...obviously that depends on how bad the accident is. If you just got a scratch they wont cover it.
File your claim ASAP. If you have car rental on your policy you can get a rental but then your stuck having your policy cover your repairs not the adverse carrier.  If you only want to go through the other insurance you will have to wait for them to investigate your claim before they will pay out. 
"Anyone can file a claim for a loss, so you can call the other person‚Äôs insurer and get the ball rolling. They might have a more available carrier and get you in a rental more quickly. "
"unfortunately there is only emergency claim forward call that can only takes care of claims not like this. I have already reported the situation, didn't have time to ask about this, and later it was after 5PM which end of business day"
"it is Arbella insurance, local company to MA"
"auto body guy said it is going to be near total. but my insurance does not cover car rental if i am the guilty one, i will just call them on Monday to be sure."
"I got hit from back, so i don't know if it stills investigation of guilty side, but reimbursement will happen in the end, so i was just curious if I need to wait instead of renting the car and asking for reimburse after that. The thing you said works if I am the guilty one in accident. Thanks fore reply tho."
"thank you, it was good call. I talked to other person's insurer, so they said we'll provide the car, and I will have time to think about changing my car insurance for next year"
You can file a claim under your insurance if you have collision and pay the deductible. Then your company can fight with the at fault party to get your deductible back. This is an option of you have the coverage and the other party won't cooperate.
Guilty or not you can file through your policy. As the other person said your insurance can go after the at fault person through subrogation process so you can get reimbursed your deductible. I‚Äôm a licensed Adjuster if you have any other questions let me know. 
"oh. thanks. So you say there is no need to wait for them and rent a car, and ask for reimbursement later? "
If you are certain they will accept 100% fault than yes. 
What insurance company do you use?  If Progressive they will waive your deductible if the at fault carrier accepts 100%. So that would be another option and you can just go through your policy. 
it is arbella. I talked to Geico (other side's insurance) and they provided claim numbers that I can use for renting a car. I think problem solved. Thanks for input though.
"I'm not sure that you'll qualify since you get disability and have a job without kids. If they deny you, you can check with your local food pantry to see if you qualify with them. I'm pretty sure that everyone's income in the house is considered. Also, if you're able to work part time, can you simply increase your hours to be full time? "
"When it comes to you and your boyfriend, if you share food, you'll likely have to file as a household using a combined income. That might impact how much you're approved for. For stretching any benefits you might qualify for, it's the same as money. Don't look at anything you get as ""free money,"" because it's not (I'm not assuming you have that mindset, I just know quite a few people who do). Treat it the same as cash. Budget, buy store brands, plan meals ahead of time. Look into some of the cheap eating subs for ideas.  
  Once you know what you qualify for/what your full monthly food budget is, it'll be a lot easier to come up with a plan. If you qualify for benefits, take the time to plan before goinf shopping."
"Most assistance wants income info on all people residing in the home...so if the two of you make more than poverty wages...you likely won‚Äôt qualify for most things. (Though I guess it never hurts to to fill out the forms, if you have the time.) 

Be honest in your application. Don‚Äôt fudge any numbers. "
"I'm not sure about GA, but at least for TX when I was getting public assistance the poverty thresholds we're extremely low. It depends on your family size as to what that number is. Since you and your SO live together your family size is 2. Given the fact that your family size is so low and the thresholds are ridiculously low, I would be really surprised if you got approved for public assistance. Not only was it difficult getting approved but they also made me go to all these classes like a once a week (just for a hundred dollars worth of assistance). If you are able to work it might be easier to just get another job then deal with the system. But if you need the money and it's an absolute last resort it might be worth pursuing. I just don't put a lot of faith in the system. "

I'm trying to apply for a better paying position, but I'm just gonna end up doing 2 jobs again for as long as I can if that falls through.

Also, while I DO qualify for a disability I don't actually receive benefits for it. Food pantrys have been on my mind as well, trying to keep all my options open."
"Yeah, we already have planned out meals and budgets and signed up for coupons and rewards for such so the food stamps are just a way to help stretch meals a bit more. Thanks for the tip on filling for combined income too, I wasn't sure how that worked.

I don't plan to abuse this; I genuinely am in need of some extra funds and while I plan on working a second job that'll help a bit."
"Got it, thank you. I'll look up more information related to GA in that respect then, and I'm not going to lie on my application even though I realize now it probably came off like that in my initial post. Sorry about that."
"Mmmm, thank you for that perspective. You might be right in that regard, it'll be more worth it to just work a second job."

His income helps a bit. If I could get a job, I would be better off though.


Also, that's not true. If you work, yeah, you'll get docked a bit but they won't outright take it unless you make too much.

"I recommend reading this [SSA booklet](https://www.ssa.gov/pubs/EN-05-11011.pdf) if you have not already done so.  Pay particular attention to pages 8 and 9 (""What we count as income) specifically SSA includes as income things that people often don't consider to be income and their definition is not always consistent with state regulations for state or local benefits:

What we count as income: Under SSI, income includes cash, checks, and other things you get that can be used for food or shelter.

Examples of income include:

‚Ä¢ Wages from your job, whether in cash or another form;

‚Ä¢ Net earnings from your business if you‚Äôreself-employed;

‚Ä¢ The value of food or shelter that someone gives you, or the amount of money someone gives you to help pay for them;

‚Ä¢ Department of Veterans Affairs benefits;

‚Ä¢ Railroad retirement and railroad unemployment benefits;

‚Ä¢ Annuities, pensions from any government or private source, workers‚Äô compensation, unemployment insurance benefits, black lung benefits and Social Security benefits;

‚Ä¢ Prizes, settlements, and awards, including court-ordered awards;

‚Ä¢ Proceeds of life insurance policies;

‚Ä¢ Gifts and contributions;

‚Ä¢ Support and alimony payments;

‚Ä¢ Inheritances in cash or property;

‚Ä¢ Rental income; and

‚Ä¢ Strike pay and other benefits from unions.

As I am sure you already know, all changes income must be reported.  ""The value of food or shelter that someone gives you, or the amount of money someone gives you to help pay for them"" tends to be a tricky one for most folks.  However ""Bills paid by someone else for things other than food or shelter;"" is NOT income. Social services is not income. 

Living off of SSI is difficult.  If you plan to use a food bank or soup kitchen or state or town welfare benefits, be sure to consult with SSA first. Same for housing or fuel assistance.

Keep it below SGA."
"SGA doesn‚Äôt matter so much for SSI. One of the best programs for SSI recipients is doing a PASS plan. Plan for Achieving Self Support. If you put aside money to go back to school, they won‚Äôt count that money as income, therefore making you cash benefit higher. "

That‚Äôs why I asked if it was a disability that would prevent working. 
If he's getting disability then it has to be a disability that prevents the ability to work.
That might have been a better point in the main post instead of saying he will lose the SSI if he works
"Isn't that how most SSI is, though?"
/r/AskNYC and /r/Travel are also places to ask
Subscribe to Scott's Cheap Flights. You can likely get at the very least a sweet (sub-$500) deal to Europe and then connect from there. Research ahead of time which European cities offer reasonable connecting flights.

"I am honestly not a fan of buying used printers as so many new ones are affordable.

1. Ask when the drum was purchased. Unlike HP, Brother printers have a separate drum that has to be replaced and is more expensive than toner.

2. Find the manual online before you go and figure out how print a special test page that lists the number of impressions or ink used in the current toner. Do that print out before buying.

3. Do a sample copy and a sample scan as well as a sample print.

4. Open up the inside and see if anything is broken. Check power cord for damage. Make sure all trays there (btw check manual for a lock for moving it)

4. Ask whether they used new official  toner cartridges. Ask if they refilled toner cartridges. Look carefully at the cartridge (is it included in the price btw?)

5. Ask why they are selling it. Ask if they had any issues with it or tips on using it.

6. As stated by someone else, go to the Brother website to check for printer drivers - also check for firmware updates and product recalls."
I wouldn't waste my time on a used laser printer. You will be able to buy new printers in the coming weeks for under 50 bucks I'm back to school sales. Office max office depot staples fry's microcenter newegg keep an eye out

There should be a diagnostics page that gives the page count 
"Print a diagnostics page with toner/drum counts. Inspect these counts. Some printers include an ""error count"" with this page as well. Google the printer to see its ""duty cycle"" and compare it to the counts and age of the printer.

Print a test page. More specifically, google ""test page pdf"" and you'll see some great test pages with graphics, gradients, texts in various sizes, etc. Use them.

Even better, use that paper (or a color magazine) to test the scanning quality.

It looks like it scans through both flatbed and feeder? Test both.

Check for scratches on the scanning glass (both the flatbed and the feeder).

Test double sided printing.

Listen to it when turning it on, flatbed scanning, feeder scanning, single sided printing, and double sided printing. Any weird noises?

Check the toner is Brother brand and how new it is.

Check if the drum is Brother brand and how new it is.

If the print counts are high, check the fuser and see if there's any damage.

Are the Brother brands of your toner and drum units within your price range and is easily obtainable?

Check if there are any networking issues if you plan on printing wirelessly.
"
You could get a refurbished one from the Brother website for about that price with warranty.
Yep! Definitely printing out a test page beforehand.

"Wow I had almost forgotten about Weiss & Hickman and Salvatore, I loved reading their books.  That must have been over 12 years ago now.  Streams of Silver was the only Drizzt Do‚ÄôUrden book I read and it‚Äôs a volume from the middle of his saga so I didn‚Äôt have the full back story but absolutely fell in love with his character and the others.  My mom is an English-French translator and has translated about 34 books and novellas in the Fantasy and Paranormal Romance genres.

How much did you pay for the wizard below?
Some public libraries and charities have annual book sales too. They can be very affordable.
I buy mine at estate sales on the last day for $1 or $2 at the most.  I read them and sell them in my annual yard sale for $2.
"Oh, I won't be keeping them too awfully long.  Too much clutter.  Both of those shelves were full to the edges with dragon and wizard statues that I've been selling off. These are mainly my sale shelves. Just unpacked the boxes and took the pic.  Once I get some more time, I will actually look through them and figure out which ones I'll be selling off right away and which I need to read.  My only stack is the bottom left with the D&D box and the Pathfinder Box and a couple other books I got from the auction a few weeks ago."
hahahaha. it IS the last book i looked at :) Its hilarious. From the 80s. SO MUCH BUSH. It's a wide book though so that's how far it sticks out. It was in the very bottom of the box.  I think they were trying to hide it from potential buyers of the lot.
The Drizzt books are what got my love for reading going. You should go back and read the beginning books. He has a bad ass origin story.
"Yep. very local.  it's a consignment auction where people from nearby who have estate items, or bought out storage lockers, or just have tons of stuff to sell, bring it to the place, then pay listing fees to the store/ auction house.  If the item sells, the auction gets a % of the sale plus whatever the buyers premium is... which I think at this place it 15%.  These auctions are run through hibid.com and I think you can search for local ones on there.  Not sure though.  We have 4 within 100 mile radius that come up on it."
There was one drop box near my house surrounded by boxes and boxes of near new books - that had just been soaked with 4 inches of rain.  I was so sad.
Anne McCaffrey's Pern series is what brought me in to reading :)
Nope I haven't actually read that series.  Only thing I've done with *these* books is take them out of the boxes to kinda see what I had.  I'll take that as a recommendation to read the series though. I bet I could find the rest easily since my house is right next door to the city library :) 
"Nope.   Did you get some stolen from you?  That's the only reason I can think of for that question.  If so, I hope they are found for you. But nah, these are from a very local auction site.  It's a consignment auction where people who buy storage lockers etc put their stuff to sell on weekly auctions. "
"All the wizard stuff my dad bought full price which for the current ones I'm not certain.  They are usually $30+ at the truckstops he used to buy from. The entire family room was dragon and wizard themed, with probably near 50 statues.  He bought a new house and gave them all to me to do with what I wished. So, I've got the awesome ones set aside to put I'm my gaming room once I get shelves built."

"Thank you, /u/DrizztDo, and awesome username.  I trust your perspective for sure!  Once I realized that I was missing a lot of back story, I was already so into the book that I had to finish it even if I was lacking  the ‚Äògroundwork‚Äô and backstory.  I‚Äôm sure I can just Google it, but since you‚Äôre clearly passionate about the storyline I‚Äôd rather ask a real person like you.  Which is the first book to start with and how many were there before Streams of Silver?"
"BLUF: If you're into science fiction, yes, I would recommend it.  (it appears that you probably are)

If you're not into science fiction, I might stop at the first book.

Hyperion, which is the first book in the series, is framed like Chaucer's *Canterbury Tales*.  You have the 4th and final book book on your shelf.

I won't say more, I don't want to give anything away.  The overall story arc takes some bizarre twists and turns.  Not like surreal bizarre, just sort of like, whoa, WTF is the deal with this."
"No, they weren't stolen. I had donated them to a library, who told me they had most of them already and would prabably sell them. I was more curious. I have always imagined they went to a loving home somewhere to be enjoyed again :). "
Or Hoopla Digital! 
There are 4 books before Streams of Silver. That's the second book in what's known as the Icewind Dale trilogy. Homeland is where you should start. It's the first book in The Dark Elf trilogy and covers Drizzt's origin. It's a bad ass book and an emotional rollercoaster.
:) Glad they weren't.  I'm sure whoever did get them had some awesome reading.
"Thank you, much appreciated!  Gonna check them out now."
"your cell bill it outrageous.  If going to a flip phone is what you need to do then that's fine, but you're kinda going from one extreme to the other.  I just got a really cheap smartphone and a 50 dollar/mo plan with 8 gigs of data.. more than I ever need."
My cell bill is $40 flat pre-paid 
How on earth are you paying that much? I splurged on a phone and I only have 1g data but the bill is only $35
"I think you're paying too much for a smart phone, and you can get a smartphone plan for much cheaper. My husband refuses to be frugal about the phone bill, partially because we are in a family plan, and we still only pay about 60 each

In terms of the flip phone, careful because you may realize you need now to buy a few items to replace what you use to use the smartphone with. For me, the GPS and traffic updates with my smartphone are ab absolute necessity as I would literally be lost without it half the time. "

"About 15 years ago, I switched from a rotary phone to a flip phone.

The phone cost 40 dollars and I pay a bit less than 10 dollars a month for basic service. The phone lasts a couple weeks without needing to be recharged and recharges in an hour. And the company doesn't get anywhere as much information from me.

I'd never get a smartphone."
"I would not, for several reasons.

Utility.

My experience with flip phones in 2018 is that they don't handle group texts, and I am not notified that the message is not getting through.

Your costs are not well managed.

I paid cash for a used iPhone 5 three years ago, and I plan on using it for 12 more months before upgrading ($250/48 = \~$5.20/mo). I purchased it from a co-worker who wanted the new 6s and had treated their 5 very well. I use an MVNO for service (mint in my case) on a 2gb/mo plan. I have wifi at home and work, so as long as I am not streaming music during my work commute 2gb/mo has never been a problem for me. I pay $180/year ($15/mo) for this service.

Your monthly costs are 11x higher than mine are. For the cost you are currently paying right now over a 12 month period, you could purchase a $1,000+ phone in cash and sign up for a higher data package with an MVNO and still save money.

MVNO's might not be a good option for you based coverage, but I would re-evaluate my phone plan first. I would also question why you think you need to upgrade your phone every 24 months. Pay in cash every 36 or 48."
"No, many carriers are shutting down legacy networks that these devices run on.

But there is a great way to save money.  Buy a used device or buy a cheaper phone.  Many people can use something like a Moto G5 Plus, Moto G5S Plus, Moto G6 Play, Moto G6 Plus, Moto X4 which are all available for $400 or less.  They are available completely unlocked so you can bring them to whatever network you'd like.

Here's some options with unlimited data that will dramatically lower your monthly bill:

Virgin Mobile (Sprint's network): unlimited talk, text, and data first six month are $1 per month.  Goes up to $50 per month after that.

Boost Mobile (Sprint's network): unlimited talk, text, and data with 8 GB of mobile hotspot $50 or unlimited talk, text, and data with HD Streaming and 20 GB $60.

Cricket Wireless (AT&T's network): unlimited talk, text, and data with 3 mbps speed cap $50 with autopay discount or unlimited talk, text, and data with 8 mbps speed cap for $55.

AT&T Prepaid (AT&T's network): unlimited talk, text, and data $55 with autopay discount.

MetroPCS (T-Mobile's network): unlimited talk, text, and data $50.

Verizon Prepaid (Verizon's network): unlimited talk, text, and data $75 or with their current double data promo unlimited talk, text, and 20 GB $60.

Visible (Verizon's network): (iPhone only for now) unlimited talk, text, and data with 5 mbps speed cap $40.

There are more options as well.  You can hop over to r/nocontract."
I'd get on a different plan. If you're on a contract that could be expensive. I'm on FreedomPop.

I recommend it.  I use a flip phone and it's about $15 a month pre-paid minutes.  I don't use internet on it ever.
"I use a service called MintMobile. I'm on their $15/month plan. You get unlimited talk, text, and data, but the data is throttled after 2 GB. If you pay more, you get more unthrottled. They have 3, 6, and 12 month plans. You have to pay for the whole term in advance. You can BYOD if it will work on their network. They use the T-mobile network. "
Just get a pager.
"Do you currently own your phone(s) outright?

Look to switch to a prepaid plan from the same company.  I cut my bill from just over $200 to $90 by doing this - and that was for 4 lines.

Another good option is MVNO providers (e.g., Straight Talk ... etc).  Find one that will provide a sim to use with your existing phone.

You got this!"
Fully functional smart phone here. Bought my phone out right and pay 40/mo for unlimited text and data. 
How many phones do you have on that plan? There are much cheaper alternatives. You probably can find flip phones somewhere these days but the difference between that and the cheapest smartphone plans are marginal.
"Like others mentioned, you have to remember that if you switch to a flip phone, you'll have to replace it with other items that a smartphone can provide (like a standalone GPS). Tracfone sells smartphones for really cheap, usually in the $20-$40 range if you buy it from places like Dollar General or Family Dollar. And they have pay as you go plans, the cheapest plan is $7 per month. I've been with Tracfone for 10+ years and am very happy with it."
"Cricket. Uses the AT&T network. $35 per month unlimited data. Bring your own device, but you can buy some there. I bought last years model for $10."
">I think the whole idea of spending $1,000 on a phone every 1-2 years is just ridiculous and the cost of having unlimited data is just as insane.

Motorola G5 plus' were just over $100 the other day on sale. They have a nice big screen, a good enough camera, and hold up well. Cut your data usage, you can easily get solid coverage with plenty of data for $40 or less a month if you go prepaid. "
I use And recommend republic wireless.  Currently using a Moto G5 plus on their Network for $25/month with 2GB included.  Also it defaults to calls over WiFi so network coverage is not an issue at home or work. Great call quality and you can eliminate data altogether and pay $15/month.
"The $15 plan is 2 gigs data and only for the first three months and then it goes to $20 - which is what I pay now. Still by the far the cheapest service and the more months that you buy at a time, the cheaper it is. So if you buy 12 months of service, you get 10 gigs for $25 a month BUT you pay it all up front. "
That isn't terrible.
"I've had three Brother laser printers over the last decade that have really been fantastic (they all still work, but two got recycled to someone else as I upgraded for additional features over the years).

I would look and see if I can find one of those used for the most thrifty option, the basic one is about $60 new. It will be some $$ for toner but it lasts forever if you don't print much and doesn't dry out like an inkjet."
"Brother laser printers or alternately some Dell laser printers are rebadged Brother printers. Check sites like Slickdeals or the like and you should be able to find a good one that way if you're patient. 

Alternately check Craigslist and similar sites for older HP Laserjets. Those are built like tanks and last forever, though they may require maintenance from time to time (replacing rollers) but anyone with a screwdriver should be able to do it. Parts and toners are cheap. "
"I have a brother laser printer I got four years ago still on the sample cartridge for ""ink"" that came with it. I also only use it for shipping or the rare page I need to print out. I waited until I saw it on sale at staples and then happily carried it off for I think 30$

""HappyD2"" as I dubbed it still going strong."
The most frugal printer is the one that uses the most frugal ink. I also have a Brother laser printer because of the availability of inexpensive replacement cartridges.
"I also had a Brother laser printer model HL-2035
and when the cartridge ran out I went on eBay and bought a carbon refill cheap and cheerful, oh and refilling was easy to do as well. now I wouldn't go back to a normal printer."
"Refurbished Brother printer from their online store. We got the one for $90 that does duplex (two-sided) printing, plus Google print and AirPrint. It's amazing and you can print from any device wirelessly.

They do have cheaper refurbs, fewer features..."
Staples has a laser printer on sale now
"I second this, and was going to vote the same. It's like a little black box of joy. I used it through school and to make zines. The ink is ""expensive"" but lasts forever. And my brother still uses this and says it's great. That's like...ten years later. Mhm.

Edit - As an aside, I'll tell you I never had an ink jet as good. I just ended up throwing seas of money into shitty soon to dry up cartridges. In the end, I only ever used them for scanning art. I just gave up on the printing function completely, and would go to UPS if I needed anything. "
Any idea which model I could search for used that isn‚Äôt necessarily the newest but still ‚Äúrelevant?‚Äù I literally only use it for printing shipping labels lately 
"> little black box of joy

Love this!!! They really are..."
"All of the ""HL-"" series should be good - that's are the basic monochrome laser line. I now have a DCP-series because printing double-sided wirelessly from my phone is really cool, but it's probably more than you need.  :)  Still if you found one for a good price you might check it out because scanning and copying are also handy from time to time. I think I paid right around $120 new for that one, during a sale some years back.

I imagine any of them would work fine, so long as it's a laser and not inkjet (not sure if Brother ever even made inkjets), and you don't care about special features. Brother has a good support website so I doubt getting drivers is an issue, no matter how old it is.

TLDR: Any of them probably."
What's so bad about t mobile and Samsung.   I love both
"Companies that have lost my business forever: 

* A local car dealership. If a car dealer routinely treats you like crap, walk away. There are so many other people selling cars there is no reason to go to crappy ones. 

* Apple: They used to make decent products and OSX is still a good OS but good luck trying to repair any of their products. It's a shame as the first couple gens of Intel Macbooks were a dream to repair. 

* GE Appliances: Sold to Haier and they've since become overpriced pieces of crap. They weren't much better before the sale. Anything they sell you can find a better option for elsewhere. 

* Netsle - There's a lot to google about them but basically they are pretty damn unethical. Hard to avoid buying their products but it can be done. 

* Sirius XM. If your new car offers you a trial, say no thank you. They will hound you until you die to try to resubscribe. I had to report them to my state AG and the FTC for all the harassing phone calls. 
"
"I've had mixed results with Samsung. We've had a couple of their phones without major complaint. But trying to get their exploding clothes washer field repaired was a total fiasco.

T-Mobile has been 5 star. Our military family plan costs $20.50/line for 9 lines of unlimited everything. Our family loves it and we are literally saving thousands $/yr. Customer support via twitter has been phenominal. Their billing system for ported in numbers mid cycle didn't make any sense, but a note to them and they credited my account. Always courteous and get things done without hassle.

TL;DR - your experiences may not be typical."
"They make a great product, don't get me wrong, and I would be lying if I said I didn't own any. So I am a little hypocritical on this jawn, but: Yeti. They were amazing when they first came out. Blew my mind. Now there are so many knock-offs out there that work exactly the same at a tiny fraction of the price, I can't really justify, intellectually, buying a Yeti over a cheaper alternative. And yet here I am, with three yeti cups and buying my fiancee a cooler for Christmas."
"I bought new appliances about 4 years ago, all Samsung. This year the dishwasher and microwave went out and had to be replaced. Honestly, I am not sure that is a Samsung specific issue. I think it is simply that nearly everyone makes junk nowadays, because they can and people buy it. So, when I replaced it this year, I basically went with the cheapest microwave I could that had the options I wanted ($185), figuring that to likely just be a cost every few years to have a microwave.  No, I'm not going to pay $1,000+ then pay many $100s to repair - I figure $185 every two years is a reasonable cost for the use of a microwave so I'll just do that.  (Really not happy about all that bad product ending up in the landfills though -- stuff should be made better for sustainability reasons, too). "
"I've had great experiences with Tmobile personally.  Not so great ones with Samsung appliances.  (Dishwasher and microwave went out within a couple of months.) They were purchased  as scratch and dent,  so not covered under the warranty.  I probably won't buy Samsung appliances again,  but will definitely stick with Tmobile."
"Fapple- Courage, Live the dongle walled garden life."
"I usually buy the buy one get one free phone from T-Mobile then I keep one and sell the other one for full price. 
Last year I got two s8 and this year I got two s9. 
Btw you will have to get a new phone line and keep the line for 3 months to get the buy one get one free deal, which isn't a problem because at the end I'm only paying $120.  "
"3 MOBILE UK. is terrible customer service absolutely terrible, for a start, everything has to be done over the phone to an outsourced under qualified call centre in India that is very hard to understand the accents they give you every excuse in the book and purposely give out the wrong information and pass you from dept. to dept. It has taken me 3 months after her contract ended to get my mum out of her dealings with them, and they have a service that you can't opt out of called 'payforit' that automatically signs you up for services you never asked for total SCAM.  STAY AWAY FROM 3 MOBILE UK. LIKE THE PLAGUE YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!."
"Asus. I had a laptop with a ""non-removable"" battery in it. Followed instructions for taking it all apart, which was like trying to break into a safe, so many unnecessary screws and parts to remove just to access the battery. Once the new battery was in the screen failed. I also purchased a motherboard from them in the past, which had a faulty ram slot right out of the gate.

 Horrible company, who has poor plans in their builds and makes it as hard as they can for you to do any work on your items. I'll never purchase from them again."
Nestle.
I have had nothing but fun and joy with my new Samsung Galaxy S9 phone brought to you by Verizon Wireless!
"Still rocking a Samsung S3 and bought a Tab E two years back. Both are great. No complaints and minimal performance loss.

I am also a tech guy though so I keep my devices in pretty good shape"
"tmobile lies about their unlimited plan. This is extremely unethical. You cant say things like 'lead free' but really that means that there is only 3% lead...

They also bait and switched their free 'digits' plan. During this mess that took multiple weeks, someone added an additional 25$/mo plan to both programs. Not sure if this was intended or an accident. The store rep couldnt help me saying I used one of the benefits of the service and couldnt get a refund.

Samsung just has medium quality products at expensive prices. Their screens are ultra bright to give the impression of quality, but the goods inside are unreliable and slow. Ive heard lots of complaints about samsung appliances. Ive also had issues with their harddrives. "
"> Netsle - There's a lot to google about them but basically they are pretty damn unethical. Hard to avoid buying their products but it can be done. 

As another person who doesn't buy Nestle, I have to disagree. They mostly make junk food and bottled water, and all their brands are clearly marked as being owned by Nestle. The hardest thing was no more Haagen-Dazs for my wife but there are lots of other premium ice cream companies to pick from. They also make a good amount of baby food & clothes (including the Gerber brand) but that's also a crowded field with lots of competitors to buy from instead. "
"We're definitely avoiding Samsung for life now. We've had a few phones whose components all started to fail much sooner than they should have, despite pretty careful use. We also had a three year old fridge fail and Samsung wouldn't give us the time of day. Absolutely ridiculous. I've got friends who have had brand new Samsung washer/dryers fail as well.. It's actually a little mind boggling."
"After they disassociated themselves from the NRA apparently a lot of people gave up their loyalty to them and are selling them on Craigslist and what not. So now's the time to buy used, I guess."
"A little research can go a long way but often it's all about knowing the failure points and forgoing some bells and whistles for just the basics. For example I could buy a fancy French door fridge with the freezer on the bottom and built in ice maker, water dispenser, touchscreen running Android OS etc. or I could buy a large box with a freezer box on top of it. The former costs a lot more and is far less reliable than the cheaper, no frills option.

I don't have an answer to your microwave issue. My wife bought a Hamilton Beach off of a pile in the middle of a Walmart aisle (I think it was a back to college event) for around $50 and it's lasted us eight years. Some of the paint on the inside has flaked off where the carousel spins but everything I've read online said that's just a cosmetic issue. "
"That never happened to me.   Maybe the representatives at your T-Mobile don't offer good service. If you call them make sure you ask to speak to the customer relations department, they are nicer and will help you.    As for the the Samsung, I love Samsung more than other phones (this is my opinion.  Im not trying to challenge any other phones)"
What you said about the unlimited plan is true.  I don't lile it either but at the end I'm saving more than other service providers.  Also T-Mobile has unlimited slow data roaming.  
"I thought the NRA blew that out of proportion. If memory serves, Yeti replaced their (andany other groups') discount with a slightly smaller one and the NRA shit bricks. "
"> forgoing some bells and whistles for just the basics

Agree with you on that. Definitely avoid the touchscreens and that small middle drawer too (though we did get an icemaker, knowing that many fridges end up with issues on that based on reviews).  On stoves, a relative had purchased one without knobs -- all functions controlled by an electric panel. So, when that expensive panel went out it was a fortune to replace the panel...  I'll stick to physically turning an old-style knob! "
"Yeah the unlimited data being a lie was the end of my favorable opinion of tmobile.

Extremely unethical to have commercials that have only the word:

UNLIMITED

No astricks. Just the word UNLIMITED with white and pink. They know they are tricking people. Ive contacted their CEO John Legere about this and he just ignores it and sends his drones in to talk about technicalities.

Everyone knows tmobile is being scum with this deceptive marketing."
"You‚Äôre about the only person with this opinion. It‚Äôs clearly described at purchase, in the terms and conditions, and every advertisement includes some disclaimer. 

It‚Äôs also the same 100% across the industry with every single carrier. 

You seem like the kind of customer they probably don‚Äôt want either so I guess it‚Äôs best you break up. "
Every company has limited unlimited data. If it wasn't limited then it wouldn't be that cheap. 
">It‚Äôs clearly described at purchase

You mean the words UNLIMITED in all caps? Or something else? You wont win this. The definition of unlimited is:

""not limited or restricted in terms of number, quantity, or extent.""

This is undoubtedly unethical to say one word, but mean the opposite. Btw here is their marketing, and I'm not the only person complaining. https://imgur.com/a/6rWYOWN Lets not defend the billion dollar company who knows they are misleading their customer. 

>You seem like the kind of customer they probably don‚Äôt want either so I guess it‚Äôs best you break up.

Like I said bait and switch. Did the phone promo so I'm stuck for another few months. "
"If you‚Äôre so right and just sue them for false advertisement and quit whining. See where you get. Action and not words is how things change. Enjoy wasting your time though since everyone agrees, they‚Äôre not misleading.

What flavor iced tea do you get? I can tell you how we make it 
Like give me your exact order 
"I can't help you with the recipe, but I would like to suggest saving even more money by making simple syrup. It's outrageously easy and store bought is outrageously overpriced. Good luck with your venture!!"
Did you add a ton of sugar? Cause most of the drinks at Starbucks have that.
Well I can't help much without your exact drink order but I can tell you the blackberries are freeze-dried.
"To be honest I probably have the worst answer to this. I was addicted to Starbucks, so I just got a job there a couple months and now I get as much coffee as I want, and instead of paying for it, I get paid!"
"Buy the syrup from Starbucks. They will sell you the bottles of syrup for around $10, which is not bad compared to the ridiculous price of the syrup in grocery stores. At my local grocery store, it‚Äôs actually cheaper per ounce. I do this then make my own iced coffee at home. Tastes the same and the syrups lasts me through a few gallons of coffee concentrate."
"First, it's not going to taste 100% the same because you aren't going to get the **exact** same dried blackberries they use, or the **exact** same industrial tea bags.  But you're likely going wrong on the tea or berries.  I'd change the tea, since it's less expensive."
Did you make the tea double strength? You gotta make it extra strength so it doesnt get watered down when you shake it
"by the looks of it, you‚Äôre getting a white tea with the sweetener which is a liquid cane sugar (assuming you‚Äôre frequenting a corporate store). simple syrup will taste different, the liquid cane sugar is less heavy, especially in the white tea, and when we put the liquid cane sugar in it, one pump is actually only equivalent to half a pump. so if you‚Äôre getting a grande (16 oz), the 4 pumps we would typically put in it is only equivalent to 2 reg pumps. we also brew our tea double as strong and add half water, half tea. 

if you are still willing to pay some money for starbucks, i would suggest ordering a trenta white tea, no water, no ice, no sweetener (so essentially just 30 oz of tea), and use that throughout the week or however long it lasts you. add your extras at home. this is usually what i do as a starbucks partner when i have a couple days off!

I‚Äôve tried making my own iced coffee and cold brew and it‚Äôs just not the same as Starbucks. Sigh. 
"It's all down to sugar content. Whatever you think is enough isn't enough. Double, triple, quadruple it till it tastes the same, then do yourself a favour and throw away that syruppy mess, make one with a reasonable amount and just get used to it."

"Triple filtered water. Don‚Äôt forget to used filtered water for your ice. Buy the powdered mix for the Berry Hibiscus refresher. Some retailers have coupons.

You could go hang out at r/starbucks and they‚Äôll teach you some recipes if you promise not to be a Gertrude."
There's some psychological principle about eating food you make yourself and how it doesn't appear to taste as good as when other people make it. I'm not sure what it's called though.
A few grains of salt is starbucks secret ingredient to eveything. Below the threshold of taste it acts as a bitter inhibitor. 
"For a single vs prepped larger batch.

Step one, plan to only use enough filtered hot water to halfway fill your cup.

Step two, put in double the tea for that amount of water to brew.

Step three, spoon in a couple tablespoons of simple syrup (or squirt in the correct number of pumps for your size - at sbux unless it‚Äôs changed, its:
8 oz - 2 pumps
12 oz - 3 pumps
16 oz - 4 pumps
20 oz - 5 pumps
24 oz - 6 pumps
30 oz - 7 pumps

Step four, drop in ice to fill the cup (unless you normally do less, but keep in mind at least half the ice will melt with hot tea brewed this way).

Step five, add tea to ice and simple syrup in cup once the tea has steeped long enough (read tea‚Äôs directions for this).

Last steps, add in berries, lid your container and shake for full infusion. If using fresh berries, keep in mind the dried ones are coated in sugar so add another tablespoon to even out. If the berries are less ripe, middle them with the ice before you pour in the tea.

Make sure all water used (including ice) was filtered because water flavors can affect your final drink taste more than you realize.

Finally when it‚Äôs close but not quite right, you get to play with it!"
"Simple syrup is has less flavor than the liquid can sugar we use at starbucks!

Maybe try finding a liquid cane variant instead of simple syrup.

Hope this helps!"
"Make sure you are using filtered water. Municipal water can make tea taste very weird, especially if it's hard water."

"Chef and tea enthusiast here. I'm not sure how you're brewing it but the most important thing I have learned in my culinary career is temperature. Tea leaves brew at different temperatures and all have optimal temps. If you're brewing too hot, you burn the leaves and it give a completely different flavor."
Do NOT buy simple syrup. It's literally half sugar half boiling water stirred and cooled.
"I buy tea I like, put a tea bag in a bottle of water overnight.  The next day I have iced tea.  I keep it simple."
"Whatever homemade ice tea you make you always want to add baking soda, it neutralizes the tannins and makes it taste less bitter and much smoother. I usually add a pinch of baking soda to a pitcher."
"If all else fails and it's missing something, try adding a pinch of salt."

Simple syrup is just sugar and water. It‚Äôs cheaper to make your own. 
I don‚Äôt know how to make the iced tea but I have found that a bag of ground coffee is around 9-10$. Combine that with a French press and some ice cubes and you can have two cups of iced coffee a day for about two weeks. Much cheaper then Starbucks

"It‚Äôs kind of pricey, but you can buy 1L of Starbucks Classic Sweetener, the sweetener used for that shaken iced tea, on Amazon for $35. Considering you use no more than 2-4 pumps depending on the size, this would last you a LONG time.

Double the amount of tea bags and quadruple the simple syrup and you should be good. ‚ò∫Ô∏è
"For sweet tea with no attempt at Starbucks copycat, here's the process & recipe to make 1 gallon:

You'll need

* A one-gallon pitcher or repurposed milk/water jug
* 4 - 12 individual size tea bags (depending on how strong you want it)
* 1/2 - 2 Cups of sugar (depending on how sweet you want it)
* A stirring implement
* A pot or pyrex dish in which to boil the water and steep the tea
* A gallon of water

Boil about a quart of water - it's not exact.  If you use Pyrex, you can microwave it. Remove from heat and add your teabags.  Let it steep for at least 15 minutes.  Remove the teabags and add your desired amount of sugar and stir until it's completely dissolved.  If your water is still hot/warm, it'll dissolve quickly, but even if it's not, it'll still dissolve if it's at room temperature.  You don't want to add sugar once you've iced/chilled your tea; that is an abomination.  Once the sugar is completely dissolved, add ice to start cooling it down.  Pour this into your one-gallon pitcher and add enough water/ice to make a gallon.

To give some guidance on the range of sugar & teabags.  I typically use a 1/2 gallon pyrex dish to boil the water in the microwave.  I use 6 tea bags and 2/3 cup sugar.  For reference, McDonald's uses 2 cups per gallon.  Folks who use more teabags tend to use more sugar.  After boiling water and steeping the tea and adding the sugar and dissolving it, I throw some ice in the pyrex dish of tea concentrate to cool it off and then dump it in our tea pitcher and add more water/ice to get it as close to cold with as few ice chunks as possible in it.  If you're making this at least 6 hours ahead of time, you can skip the ice part and just put it in the fridge to get cold.  If you're using a repurposed milk/water jug, you'll need to use a funnel to more-easily get it into the mouth of the jug."

"Starbucks uses way more sugar than you think they are using. 

The best way to get good iced tea, if you start with hot tea, is to brew it strong. So either more bags, or steep for longer. Then pour it over the ice. This way when the ice melts it won't make the tea weak, it'll dilute it to where you want it. You will probably have to play around with it a bit to figure out the right strength"
"The best way to stop a Starbucks habit is to move to a place where the only Starbucks is inside the grocery store, and their quality isn't super great.

Now when I want coffee, I go to the coffee stand across the street from the grocery store. About the same price, but better coffee, and I don't go as often as I like to pay cash and don't carry cash on me usually."
"I have the best tea blend for iced tea using David‚Äôs Tea. 

Mix equal parts Just Peachy, Sweet Ginger Heat, and Earl Grey. I use 4 T. in 6 c. water for about 7 minutes and then dilute with ice to 2 quarts. 

"
"Starbucks uses rice or agave syrup depending on the drink.

Seriously, get some rice syrup and try it."
"OP, you need to macerate the blackberries to draw all of the sugar that way you're getting more sweetness from the fruit as opposed to just plain simple syrup. "
"Fill a cocktail shaker with ice. Add ¬Ω cup of Passion iced tea, ¬Ω cup of apple juice, 1 ounce of blackberry syrup, 1 teaspoon of lemon juice, a few blackberries and orange slices. Shake to combine, then pour everything (including ice) into a large glass and enjoy!

it has to be passion iced tea. you can get it from Amazon"
"You can make your own simple syrup too!

Just add boiling water to sugar at a 1:1 ratio"
"Tazo has a green tea and a passion whatever tea (I don't remember the names) that are the same as the ones we use. Sb still owns tazo and the taste is the same even though the teas we use aren't labeled as tazo. Idk about the white and black tea. Haven't tasted any of those. Also there's a premade box of the green and passion. When my tarbucks was closed for remodel I used those with random lemonade. There's also ""iced"" bags that make an entire pitcher of those teas.

Edit: oh shit. I thought I was in the Starbucks sub lol."
"I worked there, it‚Äôs all pre packaged. Only the Berry‚Äôs isn‚Äôt . "
drink water bourgeois 
Google 
"If you need to save money just have fewer of these drinks a month, it‚Äôs better for you too. "
"No, but I can tell you how to make a mojito.   It's the cheapest drink I make.    Mint grows like a weed, a shot of rum is around forty cents on sale (bacardi) I make the soda water in my beer kegs and a lime is around twenty cents.

And they charge ten bucks at a bar!!

Sorry, I've never had anything at starbucks besides coffee (horrible coffee) have you tried looking at youtube or pinterest?    I bet there's a mommy blogger type that has a good substitution."
Starcucks sucks. Go support your local independent caf√©.
sun tea is nice 
"I would think blueberries, blackberries, spinach, almond milk and a banana might taste good blended on high for 5 minutes. :)"
"How nice of you. While we wait for op to respond, do you mind telling me what kind of juice is used in the dragon fruit refresher? I assume it's plain mango juice but not sure."
"Awesome!! I usually get the iced black or white tea with a scoop of blackberries, sweetened. Thank you!!"
Could you tell us how the iced matcha green tea latte is made?! My sister told me about this drink a month ago and I‚Äôve had it like 10 times hahahaineedhelphahaha
Wait wait hold up can you please tell me how to make a coconut milk mocha macchiato too? They‚Äôre so expensive!!
Can you tell me how they make the matcha green tea....pretty please ;-;
"I have a random Starbucks question, how come when I order a iced coffee with vanilla creamer, it always taste different every time?  Do they not have a standard vanilla creamer?"
"Also, I heard that places like starbucks have specific water filters to make their water taste a certain way, which is why McDonald‚Äôs, Starbucks, etc coffee tastes different "
What about the shaken passion fruit teas? I love it 
How do y'all make the Pink Drink? My girlfriend and I tried to replicate it but it never quite came out right.
PSL recipe please! 
Omg can you pleaseeee share the recipe for the violet drink? 
could you tell us how you make the 'salted cream cold foam'?  Thanks!
Any chance you could tell me how to make a caramel Frappuccino?
"OMG what about the ultra caramel Frappuccino? I‚Äôm going broke, but it‚Äôs soooo good."
How can I make cold brew at home?! Some sort of crazy non heating magic coffee press?
"Venti iced white tea with scoop of blackberries.  Sometimes I get the pineapple black tea, sometimes the strawberry green tea always with scoop of blackberries "
Is the chai just the same as the box?  I try the 1:1 ratio suggested on the box but it‚Äôs nowhere near the same as it tastes in store
"Okay I have one if you're willing to help please!!

-	Venti iced coffee w/ sugar free vanilla and lite heavy cream. Sometimes with a shot of espresso but I haven't purchased an espresso machine yet so just the regs for now

Thank you in advance!!"
Thank you! Didn‚Äôt know you can actually make this.ill look this up. 
"esp if you want to get fancy and add an extract like vanilla, jalapeno (extra good with pineapple or watermelon drinks), lemon or another simple flavor (root beer could be fun with a creamy chai). you can infuse simple syrup with so many other flavors during that few minutes it takes to boil water and sugar. "
Hahaa no :) i had a grande size cup so I did 4 pumps of syrup
That‚Äôs what I ended up thinking today - maybe I need to buy frozen blackberries coz I even bought Tazo tea coz I know that‚Äôs what they use. 
And also 30% off at any corporate owned location when not working!
"Didn‚Äôt know they sold them! Thanks! I asked the barista last week what kind of
Syrup they use and he said just simple
Syrup and I made it sound like I was just asking for curiosity coz I thought they wouldn‚Äôt want me to know their recipe :)"
Why pay $10.  For $1.00 worth of sugar.  You literally just  add water to it.
Wish they did this with the other syrups. Instead they're slowly phasing out the SF syrups/bases and quit selling the syrups in general. :(
"I honestly didn‚Äôt think the fruit would make that much of a difference until this thread! I used to get boba iced tea drinks then realized that Starbucks had a healthier option with fruits instead of boba plus u get a free drink every so often. Now, the frugality in me is convincing me to stop spending on tea that I know I can make at home. I mean, it‚Äôs tea. How complicated can it be? "
How do you make it double strength at home? Add an extra tea bag?
I am actually a gold card holder. I calculated today and I spend so much at this store than I‚Äôm supposed to so trying to find ways to reduce spending. 
"Do you mind sharing what credit card you have that gives 10% cash back? 

The highest I have is a Chase / Amazon Prime rewards card that gives 5% on purchases on Amazon, so 10% would be a significant upgrade, for me at least."
"Nope, not the refresher. I get one of those shaken iced teas a lot and pay extra for scoop of blackberries. I don‚Äôt really like the refreshers except this new one mango dragonfruit but I know I won‚Äôt be able to replica that at home. "
"Know exactly what your saying!! I try to make iced coffee at work all the the time with different combinations coffee, milk, ice ratios and always end up spitting the drink out. "
My husband has found an awesome cold brewed coffee recipe from Alton Brown - I‚Äôd suggest trying it!
A grande size of the drink OP is ordering would literally only get two full pumps of liquid cane sugar...
What about the mango dragon fruit?! What‚Äôs the secret to that?! üòä
I need to know what a Gertrude is....
This might be it. Just like French fries. So simple. Deep fried potatoes then put  salt on it.  I can‚Äôt ever make mine taste like in-n-out‚Äôs.
"For larger batches you‚Äôll need to take into consideration between the tea and the ice how big your container needs to be, make extra ice, etc. that will help you decide how much tea to use, how many berries and how much syrup as well. Assuming you make it and keep it very cold I would think you could make a larger batch to drink for a few days at a time quite easily."
"Monin has a good liquid cane sugar, but it's pricey"
"Or I can just buy it from your store, correct? Some stores sell it? It sucks though coz I tried being frugal by making my own drink at home and now im gonna spend more money for a 2nd bottle of syrup "
"Does pur and brita filtered water count? Yes, I do both "
It's 80 calories... 
Is hot water from keurig too hot or not hot enough? 
I looked this up after being suggested from this thread few times.  Can you store this in your fridge after you make a batch? How am I going to boil sugar and water at work üòÇ
"I really like this idea, thanks! Do you start with hot water, let it cool then leave overnight or doesn‚Äôt matter?"
Woah really?! Idk if I would.. I guess I can try if tastes weird the dump it like other drinks I experimented on. Interesting tip. Thanks!
I read bakingsoda takes the bitterness from the tea
"I feel you but yes you got it worse than me üòÇ im sure I will eventually get the inched recipe but those refreshers? I think the only way is to buy the canned ones and add the fruits. For some reason though strawberry acai makes me thirsty, idk what it is but this new one they have - mango dragon fruit, to die for. Try it next time if you haven‚Äôt yet.  I believe it‚Äôs only for this season. "
The pink drink is harder to replicate because the strawberry a√ßa√≠ is a concentrate mix 
Yup.. had that drink once it is good but looks complicated to make at home. I try to stick to teas at Starbucks since it‚Äôs the cheaper option. Still a lot just for a tea but considering their other drinks their more affordable. 
Is this to replace sugar?
Just looked it up! I‚Äôm buying the mango Maui! Thanks! Can‚Äôt wait to try it
Pineapple Waikiki looks good too!! Sounds like the pineapple white fusion tea Starbucks has. So excited!! Thanks!!
I love the peach citrus white tea also! 
"In theory this is a really simple one, you just need to find a green tea you like iced and a peach herbal tea you like iced, add sweetener (we use liquid cane syrup, so maybe try making simple syrup with raw sugar or something?) and lemonade if desired! The infusions are just herbal teas with fruity flavors. Be sure to make both teas stronger than you think (~double concentration) to account for the mixing and the ice you'll add!"
I‚Äôm sure answer you‚Äôre gonna get from this thread is salt. A whole lot of salt and maybe a hint of msg. 
This is why I tried replicating it. Their iced teas are actually not priced as much as their coffee drinks/frappuccinos. On average I get a tall white tea with scoop of berries with no ice for $2.75. I just get ice from the ice machine at work to get little bit more out of my buck (which I know I still wasted)
"Yup, shook it a bit in my tumbler"
True. Since I don‚Äôt have the pump yet I just estimated that 1 pump is about 1 tsp. Idk why I don‚Äôt really care how much sugar they put at the store but when I‚Äôm making it I can‚Äôt I can‚Äôt put that much sugar in it (same with salt.  I always cut salt measurements in half when following a recipe) 
Starbucks uses a premade chai tea latte base. Four pumps of it for a grande + milk + ice. That's it. 
"Pink drink is just the same strawberry refresher base as mentioned above. Instead of adding water or lemonade like the strawberry refresher, it's just shaken up with coconut milk. "
But I don‚Äôt want to stop the habit. I love their iced tea drinks. I wanna be able to replicate it. So until then I would hate my life if I move somewhere that doesn‚Äôt  have enough Starbucks 
I YouTubed and saw how to macerate. The video showed sugar mixed with berries and let sit for 15 minutes. Can I use simple syrup to macerate? What do u use?
I did better than google - asked the barista what kind of syrup and how much to put but didn‚Äôt get any luck with that
"Oh yea.. I don‚Äôt buy this everyday, I just won‚Äôt. Average of 3x a week I would say. Still adds up though"
"The blackberry drink is not tea, it's a juice that had green coffee extract for caffeine. It is hibiscus juice, berry juice, added sugar, and freeze dried blackberries.

The mango dragon is also a refresher, so it is mango and dragon fruit juice with green coffee extract for caffeine, added sugar, and freeze dried dragon fruit pieces.

They're technically not tea, but rather caffeneited juice "
Possibly dragon fruit juice?
I love the mango dragon fruit also! Last summer they had the mango black tea I was hoping they will bring it back this season but they haven‚Äôt yet
"The juice is actually a Starbucks brand mango refresher base. Closet thing to it would be like a mango juice probably (maybe mango water if that‚Äôs a thing?) and then it the Starbucks base is pre-sweetened and has green coffee bean caffeine stuff (I forget the technical term). And then it gets dried dragon fruit pieces, shaken up with ice. And that‚Äôs your mango dragon fruit refresher! 


Edit: I realized there‚Äôs more that could be added to possibly better help. 

I‚Äôd possibly try finding a mango water and a mango syrup. That‚Äôll probably get you the closest to taste. Don‚Äôt add too much syrup though, try and find that perfect balance. And then if you can‚Äôt find dried dragon fruit I‚Äôd go with either cut up dragon fruit pieces (non dried) or a dragon fruit juice (I‚Äôd go for a no sugar version). Or you could get a bit crazy and off book and make a mango dragon fruit smoothie! With the ingredients above(maybe add some real mango too!). It‚Äôd be a great drink in the summer and your own spin on the drink. "
OH MY GOD I JUST HAD THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME TODAY.!!!! WHEW GOOD! 
"hi, i dont suppose u could tell me how to make a java chip?"
"mango, dragon fruit and green tea IIRC.
"
"So the steps would be:
1: pour tea into a shaker cup
2: pump liquid cane sugar (3 pumps for tall, 4 for grande, 6 for venti, and 7 for trenta)
3: add a scoop of berries
4: add ice
5: shake and pour the drink into the cup. 
6: realize that in your excitement to give the customer as much tea goodness as possible, you‚Äôve over-filled the cup and need to clean it up because excess tea is spilling everywhere while you tried to put on the lid
7: done!"
Oh Lord. I tried that a couple weeks ago and had to stop the car to spit it out on the road. It tasted like I imagine the grass under the port a potties at Coachella would taste. Plus milk. ü§¢
You can buy a liquid concentrate of it at Walmart or target for around $3.  Still not frugal but you can make 3-4 drinks from the concentrate so it is cheaper than Starbucks 
I have bought 3 different types of matcha powder and countless recipes from the web but I always end up dumping my drink. For some reason my matcha drinks end up being so bitter. Doesn‚Äôt matter how much I try to dissolve/ melt the matcha powder that bitter taste still lingers ü§Æ
"So the iced matcha green tea latte is going to have some simple (classic) syrup in the bottom of the cup, then filled with 2% milk. You‚Äôre then gonna add ice with enough room on top to put a couple scoops of matcha powder. And that‚Äôs it for the iced green tea latte! Pretty simple drink really. "
The first step is finding matcha powder. Starbucks matcha is 51% sugar 49% matcha powder. Mix with milk and ice. That‚Äôs it!
[deleted]
"This one may be a bit harder to make at home, but if you can do it I applaud you in advance. I‚Äôm also gonna tell you the iced version as it‚Äôs simpler and more frugal then going and getting a espresso machine/milk foamer. So to start out you‚Äôre gonna put some white mocha syrup in the bottom of your cup and then fill it up with some coconut milk and ice, leaving enough room for some espresso or strong coffee at the top. Then you‚Äôre going to add mocha drizzle and Carmel drizzle on top. If you‚Äôre wanting it hot, invest in a milk foamer or espresso machines and just make sure to foam the milk. Everything else will be the same. "
"I make a similar version at home. I buy those Torani syrups from Target (Carmel, White Mocha, and Regular Mocha.) I drizzle some caramel throughout the cup and add about an ounce of the white chocolate syrup. Fill glass about 3/4 of the way with sweetened coconut milk, then top with 1-2 shots of espresso. Mocha syrup on top for extra deliciousness!

I actually like mixing the white chocolate syrup with the espresso at the bottom of the cup as well, but then it's not technically a macchiato. Hope this helps! "
"If you‚Äôre wanting the green tea latte then I posted a recipe above. If you‚Äôre wanting like the green tea with matcha, then you‚Äôre gonna need some green tea that‚Äôs been either chilled or set to room temperature. After you have some green tea made and at the proper temperature, add some simple syrup to the bottom of your cup, pour in your green tea and add ice with enough room to put a few scoops of matcha powder on top and you‚Äôre set! "
We don‚Äôt have a vanilla creamer. We have ‚Äúsweet cream‚Äù which has vanilla in it. If someone wanted vanilla creamer I would explain that and probably give them vanilla syrup and half and half. 
Truth 
"It's starbucks' own brand of strawberry refresher base (a sweetened, caffeinated, concentrated juice), sweetened coconut milk, freeze-dried strawberries, and ice. Shaken to mix. I imagine it'd be hard to perfectly replicate the refresher base"
Can‚Äôt replicate that one without the syrup. And they don‚Äôt sell it :(
Hard to replicate Frappuccinos at home because of a base we had to create texture. 
"Trick is mostly xantham gum. You can buy the powder mixes to blend, Big Train is another company that makes it."
"If you google cold brew toddy you could see what we use. And then make your own from something else super cheap. 

We use cold water and let it sit for 20 hours. We coarsely ground the the coffee used. I‚Äôm sure if you find the proportions online you could easily make that yourself. "
"2nd on the Toddy rec.  I know this is r/frugal and a Toddy system is like $50, but I've made cold brew every 3 weeks or so with mine for about 4 years.  

I would recommend you get whole beans at the grocery story and use the store grinder set on coarse.  Pre-Ground coffee will clog the filter, and if you grind at home with one of those hand grinders you will get like 1/2 coarse and half fine, which will still clog the filter.  

Also, cold brew is not just for iced coffee.  Make a reg coffee using the concentrate and water and heat it in the microwave and you have a nice low acid strong hot coffee in the winter as well, without having to brew a pot.

"
"Teavana white tea, 8 oz I think most large wholesale stores carry it. I don't notice much of a difference between teacana and a few other brands on the cheaper side. Brew then ice

2-3 tbsp freeze-dried blackberries, fresh blackberries are just as good imo but they have sugar on them at the store

6-8 pumps Simple syrup. I think 1 pump =1tsp? Maybe a more recent barista can double check

That and a good shake"
I haven‚Äôt had the store chai in awhile but from what I remember it does taste very different no matter how you swing it 
"We use iced coffee blend. They usually sell it in the summer and you can brew your own. 

You can buy sugar free syrup from Starbucks as well. 

"
"You just boil water and mix with an equal amount of sugar. So boil 1 cup water, mix in 1 cup sugar. Let cool. "
There's still 11 grams of sugar in a grande size.
"Actually, all the teas are Teavana now. Just a heads up. "
"Frozen isn't the same as freeze dried. 

Frozen is just....frozen cold. 

Freeze dried means completely dehydrated and all the water was taken out of it. No exposure to cold temperature"
"Corporate Baristas don't generally care if you make it at home. Its not going to ruin his day. If you're nice and tip well, he may very well write down the exact recipe they use. "
"Controversial opinion: Starbucks actually runs on pretty thin margins and does a huge amount of product testing for each of these drinks.  So you are paying that price for the absolute tastiest blackberry iced tea as voted by all of America.  Every ""just like Starbucks"" recipe I've seen for the more complex drinks has been bs because there's this assumption that it must be simple.   It's really not..  But you will get close if you buy the correct brand tea, syrup, and figure you how to source blackberries.
   
When I worked at a coffee shop that switched to Starbucks brand, the biggest difference actually was the iced tea.  Their iced tea is better than anything I'd ever had."
"Quite complicated, evidently. I've recently started making my own fruity simple syrups using [this method](https://toriavey.com/toris-kitchen/strawberry-simple-syrup/). It's a little more involved than standard simple syrup, but the fruit flavors have carried over really well for the strawberry and blueberry syrups I've made. I don't know that this would get you all the way to the blackberry flavor you like, but it would probably cut down on the amount of whole blackberries you need to add, and it lasts longer than fresh fruit in the fridge will."
Exactly
"2% cashback, the rest is from buying gift cards at a discount. can get another 1-2% with a shopping portal.

I usually use: TopCashback > Cardpool > Citi Doublecash."
"In Starbucks training, we learn how the ""four fundamentals"" of coffee are super important and affect flavor more than you think - grind, proportion, water, and freshness. At Starbucks we have super high standards for our filtered water, and coffee is about 95% water, so that may be the biggest difference in all honesty. But you essentially want 2 tbsp fresh grounds/6 oz water, and the grind needs to be different based on your brewing method. Fine for a pour over so the water moves through more slowly and gets more flavor; coarse for a French press or cold brew since the coffee steeps in the water for a longer time; somewhere in between for a traditional electric brewer. For cold brew we steep 20 hours; iced coffee is brewed hot at about double concentration, then ice is added to make it cold and bring the concentration back down."
Alton Brown is GOAT
"But *muh processed foods lit-uh-ru-lee grow diabeetus*

Seriously, if two measures of simple syrup break your diet your diet is the problem, not the drink."
Unfortunately we don‚Äôt sell any at home packets of the mango dragon fruit yet. But I recommend ordering it in a Trenta cup (30 oz) with no ice. Gives you more than double the serving for the price of one! 
"Part of it is the anticipation. When you're making it yourself, you're anticipating eating it, so you're already producing all the enzymes in your mouth etc. When you finally eat it, you're already partially placated/desensitised, instead of 0-100 like when you're ravenous after not eating for ages and are all 'Omg this is the best thing ever'.

There's probably another/reverse sort of principle at play with your mum's home cooking. She's far from the best cook in the world, but you've eaten her food for so long your taste has adapted to that style.

I've obviously not described it exactly, but there's some science behind it which explains it partially."
I just saved this. Thank you!!
"you can go to webstaurant.com, they have good and cheap deals on ~1 liter bottle of torani syrup!"
Ya but how much sugar? Calories aren‚Äôt they only thing that matter 
It depends on the kind of tea leaves you're trying to use. If I recall correctly it's too hot for everything but black tea and some kinds of Oolong. They make tea specific kettles that have preset temps for each tea. You put the leaves in and hit the correct button and it brews at the optimal temperature. My brother uses one
Yes you can! It stays good for over a month 
"no, just tap water.  saves so much money, tastes good.  rarely i may add a splenda but rare.  the flavors are infinite"
"Salt does that, and it boosts flavor.  :) "
no for taste - like in every smoothie you ever tried to duplicate
I‚Äôve had that one too! It‚Äôs actually the one I‚Äôm currently using at work :)
Then that's definitely partially why it tastes different. Things you buy from places are usually way over sweetened or salted than what a sane person would use.
granulated sugar. here's a good guide: https://m.wikihow.com/Macerate-Blackberries
"So the ingredients for your tea are whatever Tea  you want, Liquid Cane Sugar syrup, Freeze dried Blackberries, and then you shake it.
Shaking teas helps bring out the tasting notes. "
"I think of hibiscus ""juice"" as being tea...is there a part of the hibscus plant that's used besides dried flower petals?"
What are the ingredients for the very berry & how can I recreate that?
Slightly off topic but can I ask them to make the dragonfruit one for me with no sugar? I've been wanting to try it!
"Is it possible to get them without the green tea extract?  I love the berry drink, but the green tea makes me jittery."
They also all have white grape juice
The refreshers are mostly grape juice. 
This is the bomb shiz.
"Would getting those drinks without the green coffee extract change the taste?

I want to try them but I'm 7 months pregnant. Caffeine isn't good for the baby so I try to avoid it when possible."
"Current barista/shift/coffee master here. I‚Äôm gonna break some hearts, but there‚Äôs actually no mango or dragonfruit juice in the refresher base, it‚Äôs all flavors. Like /u/the_tickleMONSTER said though, it does get freeze dried dragon fruit bits shaken in. "
How much caffeine tho? How is it compared to a cup of coffee?
Never bought starbucks in my life but good seeing someone helping out this person in need. Have this upvote my dude. 
this is beginning to sound like a r/hailcorporate post.  How convenient that a starbucks employee is first on the scene to list all the tantalizing-sounding ingredients.  What was this post about again? I now magically have 'starfucks' on my mind 
"I read your comment and just died laughing I‚Äôm so sorry I don‚Äôt think you meant it in a deadpan way but that‚Äôs how I interpreted it, many thank yous"
"Can't be right, that would make too much sense. "
"Starbucks discontinued their mango and peach syrups last year to make way for the pineapple, strawberry and peach infusions. A slightly healthier alternative "
Thanks!
"I‚Äôm not a barista but a java chip frappuccino is made with frap base (holds frappuccinos together) , ice, whole milk, coffee, mocha sauce, and chocolate chips. 
You can replicate it by blending ice, coffee, chocolate syrup, and chocolate chips. [Here](http://www.geniuskitchen.com/recipe/java-chip-frappuccino-368871) is a recipe."
It must be the sweetener then. Is liquid cane sugar same as ‚Äúsimple syrup‚Äù they sell at groceries? 
what the fuck is a **trenta**?
"Step 6, every damn time. "
What about their ‚Äònew pink drink‚Äô?
">Oh Lord. I tried that a couple weeks ago and had to stop the car to spit it out on the road. It tasted like I imagine the grass under the port a potties at Coachella would taste. Plus milk. ü§¢

I literally loled. "
Starbucks uses a pre-sweetened matcha powder. 
"Starbucks probably drowns it in sugar. You probably need twice as much 
sugar to matcha to get it using similar to Starbucks. If it's still bitter, then up the sugar again. Matcha is super bitter and the sugar will remedy that.



Another option (to lessen the sugar and bitterness) is to add a little bit of something acidic, like lemon juice, lime juice, or another citrus juice. I typically recommend lime because it's kind of middle of the road in acidity, but depends what flavors you are pairing it with. Lemon is also nice if you want the acidity with a more neutural flavor (in comparison to lime)."
Watch your water temperature with matcha.  Also you'll need to whisk it in rather than stir.
What kind of matcha powder are you using? It might have to do with the quality of the matcha you are buying. I find the lower quality ones have a more bitter taste. 
"The coconut milk mocha macchiato doesn't typically come with caramel drizzle, although I'm sure it'd be good!

Edit - TIL I was taught the drink wrong - my bad!"
I love you so much. Thank you now I can get my fix ü§§
"When I ask for sugar free vanilla syrup with cream in my iced coffee, and they ask if I still want the ""classic"" with it sometimes, I should say no if I don't want sugar, correct? We can never figure out what the classic is or if they are adding it other times and not mentioning it."
"Which one tastes better to you? Sweet cream, or half & half with vanilla syrup?"
That one girl who had my back
But could I replace it with an alternative pumpkin flavored syrup? 
Dope I will certainly be doing this. Thanks a tonü§ôüèºü§ôüèº
"It's also super easy to make cold brew without a designated system like a toddy! You can dump grounds straight in water (coarse ground, Google for the proportions), steep 20 hours or so, and then filter them out with a coffee filter, paper towel, or a cheesecloth in a funnel or colander!"
"Christ that's a lot of simple syrup

Edit: i thought it was 8 tablespoons"
Freeze dried blackberries are key...it gives it a tartness
"You can also buy a bottle of almost any of Starbuck's syrups. I think it's like $12.00-$16.00 where I live.

Edit: Liquid Cane Sugar is the specific name of the syrup we put into the teas. "

I‚Äôve made simple syrup too. Super easy. You can also buy the classic syrup and pump at Starbucks for $10 if you want to be precise about the recipe. What I do not suggest you do is buy the ‚Äúsugar in the raw‚Äù liquid cane syrup. It‚Äôs terrible. I learned that the hard way!
but... what *kind* of water?
You can go way more than 1:1 on the sugar. I usually go 3:1 because momma don‚Äôt play.
I spoil myself every now and then.. with sugar
OH. Wonder if this is how they got those infused tea bags
I can confirm it is teavana tea not tazo. Source: Im a barista.
"Freeze dried is exposed to cold. It rapidly freezes then subjects to vacuum to remove moisture via sublimation over evaporation.

Not exposed to cold is just called dried."
"Oops.. my bad. Imma be honest, I barely tipped at Starbucks and specially since I usually order from their app now. I mean isn‚Äôt the barista getting paid for making my drink already? I‚Äôm usually in and out and if into have my snack there I clean after myself. Never saw the importance of tipping at Starbucks and from what I‚Äôve heard they get paid pretty well with awesome benefits. "
I knew I wasn‚Äôt crazy!
Then just figure out how long you like ot steeped for. They do theirs to 4 minutes
Thank you!!
That‚Äôs what I do when I get my free drink! Only time I get trenta and ice in a separate cup. 
"Whenever I ask for a trenta with no ice they only fill my cup about 3/4 of the way and claim the rest of the space is where the ice should have been. I mean, I get it- but :("
">She's far from the best cook in the world,

Watch yo mouth."
"Good! I make iced chai lattes and black tea lemonades in this way, just keep the milk or lemonade separate until the last minute."
"If 80 calories (21g) of sugar takes you from good health to bad, your whole diet is fucked up, not your drink."
Cool!! K will try this after I finish the bottle
"I agree with the shaking. Brew your tea double strength so it doesnt get too watered down and when you shake it with ice, shake it really hard for like 10 seconds, you will get a much better flavor. I also always stir my coffee longer when I make it because you have to incorporate all the things you added fully. "
"So, I know we're not in /r/tea, but technically anything tea-like that isn't made from actual tea leaves is a tisane."
"Look in Mexican stores for ""jamaica"", they sell bags of the stuff to boil for easy cheaper than you'll find hibiscus tea bags for. The powdered stuff is typically really sugary so avoid that."

"Google tells me that Starbucks has 238,000 employees. If Starbucks was a US city, that would make it the [96th largest city in the US](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_cities_by_population). How outside the realm of possibility is it that someone from the 96th largest city in the US would post on reddit in a helpful way?"
That‚Äôs exactly how I meant it :)
"God but the green tea with mango really was something. 

Starbucks used to have this melon syrup long ago in the before time that was bomb as fuck. "
"It is not just the same. Syrup is bad, I get it, but when I‚Äôm craving something sweet, i choose to get sweetened tea than a bar of chocolates. I‚Äôm sure sweetened iced tea is still better. "
"Costco sells big bottles of mango nectar that are fine ad juice, and might be something you could use? It's already pretty sweet, so maybe you wouldn't need any other added sweetener."
"NICE. THANK YOU.


will let you know in two to four months maybe"
"simple syrup is normally made with refined sugar, and the liquid cane sugar that starbucks uses is a liquid version of ""raw sugar."" 

starbucks ""pumps"" are also .5 oz, so if you wanted to make a ""grande"" size drink at home you'd add 2oz of syrup. 

when it comes to the berries, the ones the bux uses are freeze dried, which you can get on amazon or maybe some specialty grocery stores? i would recommend those or maybe you can infuse some fresh blackberries into your simple syrup instead? if you dont feel like going the freeze dried route. 

i worked at starbucks for 5 years and now im a server/bartender"
you can easily make simple syrup yourself. just boil water and sugar and stir until the sugar is melted. 
"See, that‚Äôs where I fail. I don‚Äôt really know the difference between the classic syrup and the liquid cane sugar. But according to a recent google search I did just now, it seems that liquid cane sugar is more made to be a sugar flavor (made basically by making a syrup of cane sugar and water, as another person in this thread mentioned,) and classic syrup is made specifically to add sweetness to things. 

If that doesn‚Äôt make sense, try going in to your store at maybe a not busy time and asking your barista if you can sample a pump of each of the two surplus, or maybe of just liquid cane sugar, so that you could get a frame of reference for it. If you came into my store and asked me and were friendly and nice about it, I‚Äôd be delighted to help you out!"
"If I‚Äôm not mistaken, Starbucks will sell you a bottle of their sweeteners."
Starbucks will sell you a whole bottle of the liquid cane sugar for like 12 bucks and in my experience if you ask nicely they'll throw in a pump. 
Most Starbucks will sell you a bottle of their classic syrup. 
"I‚Äôm assuming the simple syrup you bought was made with either high fructose corn syrup or some form of processed sugar. Maybe try making it yourself with raw sugar. You can buy it at most grocery stores- it‚Äôs a bit pricier than the normal granulated sugar, but not too bad for the quantities you‚Äôre going to be using versus buying at Starbucks. 

Anyway, I‚Äôd start with a 1:1 ratio of water to sugar (I normally only make one or two cups at a time). Boil your water first, then add the sugar while stirring (keep the heat on also). Continue stirring until completely dissolved, and it‚Äôs a good idea to wipe up any spills immediately because that shit dries to something roughly as durable as Roman concrete. 

"
"I love black tea with blackberry flavoring. I suggest you make some strong black tea, let it cool and then add ice,get a bottle of blackberry extract and add a few drops. Then add whatever sweetner you want, I am partial to raw sugar. Then slightly mash some frozen blackberries and add them. 

I do this with strawberries too, really any berry or fruit. The extract kicks up that flavor. Make sure its extract and not oil flavor or it will be awful. 

If you use frozen fruits, just be warned they are usually bland and sour. The best ripened fruit is sold fresh, frozen is usually not as good. "
Now I'm curious if Torani's Cane Sugar Sweetener is the same as Starbucks
It's simple syrup with a little vanilla in it. 
Also the two ounces of simple syrup would be over 30 grams of sugar. You're basically drinking a soda at that point.
It is different. Simple Syrup is like Karo. This is sweetener of a slightly different consistency. 
"it's italian for ""big gulp"""
"I've never heard of a trenta. But if Spanish class taught me anything then it's 30 somethings.

I don't know who needs a liter of coffee. That's some serious coffee."
"I once ordered a trenta iced coffee when I was at a work conference for four days and dumped out the ice. Kept it in the hotel fridge and it gave me four days worth of iced coffee in the mornings. 

I can‚Äôt even fucking imagine drinking that whole thing in one sitting. "
I'm glad I'm not the only one who has never heard of that

So you have successfully made a matcha latte at home or how do you usually make it?

Mine always does! Two types of drizzle
Yeah. Say no classic if you are trying for no sugar. Classic is essentially simple syrup. 
And you could do heavy whipping cream instead of cream. No sugar. 
Sweet cream. 
"I‚Äôve never found one similar. If you did you would also need an espresso machine. 


All lattes are basically the same amount of ingredients, just different flavors. "
"The answer to ""this doesn't taste like in the restaurant"" is usually ""add about a pound of sugar and a pound of butter"". Considering this is a drink, I'd substitute yet more sugar for the butter."
"That's not too crazy. That's about 2 tablespoons, and since simple syrup is half water, it's 1 tablespoon of sugar, which is 13g. Still better than soda or juice."
i prefer brown sugar and add some vanilla
"If you want to make your berries last longer then you could also put them in the water with the sugar when you make the simple syrup,boil it a little while longer and then run it through a strainer afterwards and get some berry flavoured syrup!"
Save the bottle and refill it yourself!
"What I mean is, the drink won't taste the same without the same amount of sugar. It's really only concentrated white tea, water, sugar, ice, and freeze dried blackberries"
Ha - it's quite different when someone makes it behind a counter compared to your pumping 6-8 of a sugar syrup. Ignorance is bliss and all that. 
I thought the same thing about using Tazo tea for the iced chais that I can't help but buy. Nope. Tazo chai is gross. In case you were wondering. 
"An accurate sublimation reference in the wild. Feel like I just spotted a rare bird on a usual walk. 

Thank you!"
"Starbucks baristas pay taxes on ‚Äúassumed wages‚Äù. They use a state average to calculate what they think you‚Äôre pulling in in tips. Which meant that if I didn‚Äôt get a tip, I was still taxed as though I had. The state average was about $3/hour in tips. My store, a drive through, averaged about $1.50. That means I was taxed at twice the rate of most other partners at cafe stores. 

I think they fixed this because I got a class action settlement check. But the point is.. yes we‚Äôre paid and the benefits are good but we are still taxed on tips even if we don‚Äôt make anything. "
"I worked at Starbucks for 6 years in California and in that time I went from making $8.25/hr to $10.25/hr and even at the 10 I could barely pay my bills. Starbucks pays relatively well, but like many ""fast food"" places does not pay a living wage. I always appreciated my regulars and awesome customers who gave the effort to tip, no matter how small. We would have tips divided hourly every week, so if I worked my ass off that week with 40 hours and tips happened to be $1 / hr that week, (most of the time they were under $0.80/hr) I would be lucky enough to fill up my gas tank with my tips. More often than not my average for tips was around $25 to $30. Just something to think about. Yes I got paid to make coffee, but that job is incredibly stressful and filled with ungrateful customers and an ever increasing workload of tasks and standards from corporate.  I always appreciated the people who would be kind and toss their change or a dollar in the jar."
"Generally whatever you give is appreciated. I don't do starbucks, but my local coffee spot gets tipped well whenever i go. If you're a regular, its good form, but probably not as big of a deal as smaller businesses. Im not sure if baristas are paid regular wage or tipped wages. In IL, that is almost $6/hour difference. "
It‚Äôs generally good protocol to tip anyone who is performing a service for you.
"They're paid minimum wage. No vacation days or sick days. They might get nice benefits, if they work full time. Most of them likely are part time other than managers, which often in these types of jobs are the only salaried people. Otherwise benefits are earned rarely and probably take a long time to get. I'd just.... Keep that in mind. If you've gotten good service, tips might keep that going and help someone else out. Not trying to rant, or make you feel bad, I just like to point this out about these industries."
No problem at all!!
Don‚Äôt forget to ask with no water! 
Ask for no room. That‚Äôs not an official rule 
It‚Äôs 21g of sugar you don‚Äôt need. It also has corn syrup I‚Äôm sure and other horrible bullshit that effects weight and your teeth. Your whole diet is fucked if you can‚Äôt wrap your head around this.

"Finally I learn the meaning of the word tisane. I think it was in a Tamora Pierce book that had it, I read it over a decade ago."

Or sorrel (that‚Äôs the Jamaican name for it)
"Cold jamaica with no sugar is tart and refreshing and *really good*. I can't order any hibiscus drink in stores now anymore because it's too sweet and it ruins the flavor imo. :(

Oh also, when you boil + steep hibiscus leaves, make sure to water it down to taste after you remove them. That stuff is super concentrated.  "
"Worth a try , thanks dude"
"Oh snap, can the berry refresher base be bought on its own??"
That's a shame but thanks for answering!
Thank you for provided more interesting facts about the company related to this post (provided by an ELEVEN year veteran of reddit!  Impressive).

"I laughed as well. :)

However, having tasted a dragon fruit I would also have assumed that that drink might be a fruit blend like how most cranberry is cran apple. I don't think straight dragonfruit mash would make a juice as sweet/syrupy/thick as a Starbucks drink"
Gd I just started laughing again 
Worked at Starbucks ten plus years ago and black tea with melon syrup was one of the only things I‚Äôd get! Along with orange passion fruit tea lemonade. 
"Yeah they really should‚Äôve kept those syrups, I get asked literally every day for them "
"Oh yeah, it‚Äôs true, whenever people ask me for the peach I tell them about our peach juice and they refuse haha. They really wanted some healthier alternatives but I‚Äôm like...this is Starbucks "
So would a syrup made with raw sugar instead of refined be comparable?

Target has a big selection of freeze dried fruits! 
"Current barista/shift/coffee master here: Syrup pumps are actually 1/5th oz for standard bar pumps, and cold bar pumps are smaller than that. Mocha and white mocha are the half-ounce ones you‚Äôre thinking of. "

Thank you! I thought so but seemed too simple!
Starbucks Matcha glitters because of all the sugar.
Not only that but they add simple syrup to it too. It's basically green tinted sugar milk. 
Apparently they stopped doing that. Also I've had good luck mixing matcha with milk and simple syrup. Tastes great to me
"I've made one that tasted very close to the Starbucks version. You really do need a ton of sugar. I just added packets of Splenda to taste, then stopped drinking them after realizing how much sugar it takes to make them taste good."
"What kind of matcha do you buy for those lattes? Generally the higher quality matcha brands are way less bitter and more fragrant, so you might have better luck trying with those. When I make matcha lattes I generally just add 4g stevia and that's sweet enough for me. Adding acidity would definitely help as well. "
"If your matcha is that bitter, it is low quality matcha. Use drink quality matcha instead of cooking quality matcha. Yes, it is expensive but you just use a little. "
"How do you add in your matcha? I always add in hot water and use an electric frother to really make sure it gets dissolved in. Then I add it to whatever drink I want it in. But other than that, I'm not sure what else it could be. "
I think you're thinking of the cinnamon almondmilk macchiato!
I just looked up the recipe card and TIL I was taught the coconut milk mocha macchiato wrong. My mistake!
"Oh, why would they put that in there if I asked for sugar free syrup though? Seems risky for them when I'm asking for only iced coffee with the syrup and cream to add an extra ingredient? "
"True, I didn't know that was an option, I'll check it out. "
Ah darn. Thanks for responding!
"If you're not drinking butter you're not living! Or actually, you probably are. Why does my chest and arm hurt so much?"
"I was a chef for a while and family would come to my restaurant for my dishes. I also now cook at home every night, and when they have the food, they say, ""hmm, doesn't taste like your restaurant cooking!"" 
Well mom, it's because you're on a diet and these dishes aren't coated in butter and cream sauce. It's an entirely different way of cooking. "
"And if it's a savory drink like coffee or hot chocolate, add a little salt. You can make iced coffee taste exactly like Starbucks with a shitload of sugar and a little salt."
"Simple syrup is not half water. It starts out as half water, but most of it gets boiled out. "
Lol I read it as tablespoons. Oops.
But 3 ingredients isn't simple /s
I like to add some fresh ginger slices to my simple syrup. Makes for great Tom Collinses(?).
I see what you‚Äôre saying now. I will keep trying from all the suggestions I got o here and I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll get it one of these days..
If it's a chai tea latte it's actually a chai concentrate not a brewed tea and milk and ice.
"so would you say, you feel *sublime*?"
"But you're only responsible for the tips you actually made, so you would see that difference on your tax return. "
"I'm always amazed that Starbucks uses a pos system that doesn't allow for credit card tips. I would flat tip them more, but I often don't carry cash. I also work next door to a Starbucks, do probably half the work, make the same wage, but still probably rake in more because we have credit card tips. Starbucks makes a big show of the programs they have for employees but I'm surprised they don't address an issue that could make such an immediate change."
Stressful! LOL. 
"Yea I agree, I‚Äôm sure mom and pop coffee shops are almost at minimum wage but getting paid minimum wage doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean you should get tips,correct? I mean if you leave your cup or trash on the table then you should. I look at it as there are a lot of minim wage workers, I‚Äôm sure a lot of custodians who clean offices at night live off of minimum wage, do you leave them a tip before u leave work that afternoon? They are definitely cleaning after you, why don‚Äôt they get tips? Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I tip fairly. Whenever I eat out it‚Äôs 10% for bad service, 15-20% for good to great service but at a coffee shop? I just can‚Äôt justify. The only reason I‚Äôm there for more than 10 minutes is coz of long lines and waiting for my drink. "
"I've questioned this for myself, but never asked anyone. I drink black coffee and it is $2.55 or $2.75 at the place I go depending on size. I typically just pay $3. Am I a dick? (Barista's make at least $10.75/hr based on min wage laws, and tips can not count against it.) "
Do you tip at McDonald‚Äôs?
"Tips are awesome, not debating that.  I do want to point out though, that we do earn both vacation and (just recently) sick time, and benefits are available to anyone that can average 20 hours a week.  Pay varies wildly  so I can't make a blanket statement about that, but Starbucks as a rule, starts above minimum wage. "
"No shit, I never said it was needed. Nothing other than water is needed. Do you eat only lentils, rice, oranges, frozen spinach and textured vegetable protein?

Also it's cane sugar, even though they're the same fucking thing, the only difference being companies usually use corn syrup because it's cheaper.

My diet is just fine thank you. When I want to lose a pound a week, I lose a pound a week. When I want to gain a half a week, I gain a half a week. I'm in the gym 5x a week. And guess what, I had a beer last night and I woke up still not diabetic. It's like it's magic...

Or maybe it's more like counting your macros and calories is 95% of what makes up a good diet, and you can sure as shit fit in a tablespoon and a half of sugar if you want."
"Tea is the bathwater of tea leaves. You can drink the bathwater of all sorts of things, but this doesn't mean that Gal Gadot is tea."

You boil your simple syrup? I just use hot water. It all dissolves the same. Looking online it seems to be half an half on whether to boil.

 I don't know about custodians in general, but my father is a custodian at his church part time, and gets paid fairly well, deservedly so. Its not really a good parallel though since they are employed to do a specific service to a certain standard. But: If you leave them an abnormal mess, why not leave them a 5 for a beer or coffee after work? Tipping is leaned on a bit too heavily in the U.S., so its a very touchy subject for some. For me, if i can spare it, i do, but thats my choice. I won't judge you for not. "
Yeah I would never tip a barista. They literally are just doing their job by making the drink. They aren't going across the restaurant to bring my food to me personally and then checking up on me.
"I don‚Äôt think you are. I usually pay with my card, don‚Äôt carry cash so I don‚Äôt (can‚Äôt) round up. "
"I think convention would probably put it in the same category as bartenders, which ive always been told $1-2 per drink, more if its complicated. I've never been certain if they were considered tipped employees or not, but i half expect it varies by company, and possibly state laws"

3. FAST FOOD AND COFFEE SHOP TIP JARS
The Emily Post Institute‚Äôs official policy is that there‚Äôs no obligation to put a dollar in the tip jar, but if you‚Äôre a regular or you‚Äôre asking for a complicated order, please be generous. While baristas generally make minimum wage, chances are they‚Äôre not getting paid much more than that. The Washington Post reports that at one D.C. coffee shop, tips account for around an extra $3 per hour for workers, while at a local La Colombe, baristas get about $50 a day from tips. When you‚Äôre slinging lattes to pay your bills in an expensive city, that kind of extra money can make a big difference."
"I don‚Äôt go to McDonald‚Äôs, but I would offer if I did. Their jobs are literal hell."

Well isn't the whole purpose of simple syrup that you're creating something like sugar but in a liquid form so that you don't need to worry about dissolving it? Seems counterproductive to include ALL of the water you used because then you're also watering down the drink you're putting it in. To me it'd make more sense to boil as much water out as you can so you're left with mostly sugar and just enough water that it doesn't crystallize 
Your pedantry is unnecessary. Syrups have viscosities that vary with moisture content and the temperature they were cooked at. I do boil the water out because it produces a better product.

"Backstory: Just moved in and have 0 appliances hooked up, AC was set at 72 originally and supposedly I'm generating this amount of kWh's. Is this common usage by default? Or should I be alarmed? I'm a little inexperienced with knowing what to expect, however it seems 500 kWh is pretty standard for a one bedroom apartment like mine.  
  
I ask mostly because if I used this much electricity every day ill be way past 1000 kWh per month, raking up some serious bills with my current plan.  
  
  
EDIT: Here's the [day two electricity use graph](http://imgur.com/a/2cMBvn8). Around 3:00pm my SO turned the AC up from 72 to 76, just so we could experiment a bit."
What electric appliances do you have? Location/climate? An AC set at 72 in the summer in Texas could easily account for this much usage.
"I have a two bedroom apartment and on my days where I use the least amount of electricity, I can go as low as 3 kilowatts in a 24 hour period. I average between 180-300 kw per month. The average american family uses 900 kw per month, so to answer your question, yes it's common (though yours might be a little on the higher side), but this is r/frugal so you need to tighten up your electricity usage if you want to save on your electric bill. My suggestions for how I keep mine so low:

No AC and no heating. I use fans instead of AC and in the winter I only turn on the heat if it starts dipping below 55 degrees.
I unplug everything -TV, gaming consoles, computer, microwave, stove, wifi router box- everyday when I'm asleep, away at work, or not actively using something when I'm at home.
The only thing I leave running 24/7 is the refrigerator."
"Any chance that another apartment may be using some of your power?

Next time you go out for the day shut all the breakers off but for your fridge/freezer... see if your neighbors are puzzled why a room/wall stopped working in their unit."
"Last month I used about 0.2kwh of electric per hour on average. But I'm super frugal with utilities and hardly use the A/C. 

What kind of climate are you in?"
"1.7 kWh per hour is 1.7 kW or 1700 watts. This could be sane over short periods of time. For example, running an AC and microwave at the same time would probably exceed this. 

Over what amount of time did you measure to come up with this number? "
"I work at a power company. Usually, energy consumption goes up as people arrive home, start cooling/heating the house, run laundry and dish washers, use electric ovens for supper, etc. However, people often forget that some things stay on during the day, like freezers and air conditioners (as you‚Äôve mentioned below) as well as electric water heaters. Those are cyclical devices whose demand varies over time, which helps explains your variation is usage as the day goes on. Hope this helps. "
"No small appliances plugged in yet, there is a refrigerator, oven/stove, microwave, and AC. Other than that just 2 ceiling fans and some lights for my one bedroom apartment.  
  
  
Yesterday (the image) the only appliances really in active use would have probably been the AC at 72 degrees Farenheit and the Refridgerator. However I'm unsure how it's possible those two alone could use 1.6-1.8 units of electricity per hour on average. "
"Great ideas, I would however maybe also recommend that you get power strips instead of unplugging everything to assist with the entire process. If I'm not mistaken the power buttons on power strips disconnect the circuit, essentially doing the same thing your doing currently. "
"Definitely a good point, I'll check that. I know your not supposed to make turning off breakers a habit but checking for some stolen electricity would be a good check-off the list of possibilities. "
"98 to 102 Farenheit heat on average, pretty dry mostly, humid after storms."
"I'm inexperienced in electric units, I see that people use kWh as a unit of measurement for electric usage for a month, I figured I could use it in that sense with day-to-day operations too. However kWh per hour sounds redundant, in the image it shows about 1.6 - 1.8 eletric units of usage on an hour basis, which I presume is kWh?"
"Definitely a lot to experiment with. Luckily with these reports I should be able to track it down, hopefully. "
"You could have an electric water heater, although not all apts have individual water heaters for each apt."
"I do use power strips, I guess I should have clarified."
"That amount of usage is probably pretty normal for a climate where the A/C has to run that much, then. We rarely are above 90 here."
"Oh! I missed that there was a photo at the link (sorry!). The axis on the left should probably be labeled ""kW"" rather than ""kWh"", but that's obviously not your fault. (And to be honest, I don't get a graph like this at all lol. So that's pretty cool!). 

Averaging 1.7 kW over the course of the day seems like a lot to me. 

A few thoughts: 

- Does the pattern basically make sense to you? (Using a lot of power between noon and 8 p.m.)

- Does the huge increase after 10 p.m. seem sane? 

- What does today's report look like? Does it start off real high like how this one ends? 

- Your A/C was set to 72. Is it a lot hotter than that outside? 

- Try shutting off you A/C and see if that helps? Try to determine if your A/C is drawing more power than it's supposed to be according to its label. If it is, try replacing the A/C. "
would the electric heater account for a greater amount of electric usage? 
Oh my bad! Was just trying to share some advice as it didnt look like you did haha.
"I was kinda thinking of that too, the hotter climate would definitely explain the changes in electric usage at the times in the graph since I was going in and out around then. However would the AC still produce that 1.7 kW usage passively?"
"Great suggestions! I appreciate your thoughts and will definitely get in on experimenting with the AC Temperatures. The spikes in kW use make sense as those were the times I was present and using stuff such as phone chargers and fans. I plan on buying an electric outlet meter of sorts and measuring what appliances I can to obtain some empirical data.  
  
  
I have suspicions it might be the Refridgerator, however I'm unsure what model it is. From my understanding there was a new model of Refridgerators discovered a decade or two ago that uses less electricity. "
"Seems like a lot for that. Unless the apartment had been empty before you and they had shut the thing off and it had to work overtime to get up to temperature. Then that could make a little more sense. 

I'm guessing it's A/C. Have you gone back and checked your graph for today? "
"No worries, I did say unplug in my original post but of course I should have mentioned power strips. I just assumed most people already use power strips, it's easier to turn everything off."
72 is really low for an AC unit especially with 90+ weather. Even the most insulated houses will leak heat with all doors and windows closed. Best way to check is turn off the AC for an hour or two and see what happens to your reading then.
"> The spikes in kW use make sense as those were the times I was present and using stuff such as phone chargers and fans

Hmm... a charging phone uses about 5 watts (.005 kilowatts), and a regular fan uses about 75 watts (.075 kilowatts), so that doesn't really explain it. 

Also note that you could get a KILL-A-WATT gadget that helps you measure how much a particular plug-in thing is using. I believe they cost about $20 but a lot of libraries have them that you can check out for free. 

EDIT: With the high temperatures you mention elsewhere, it really could be your A/C. Not sure if you have built-in A/C or a window unit, but might want to try to limit how much you use it. Maybe set it to 78 or 80 rather than 72? "
"Here's the [day two electricity use graph](http://imgur.com/a/2cMBvn8). Around 3:11pm my SO turned the AC up to 76, which explains that spike. Will be watching it closely to see if I can figure out those other spikes."
"Good point, I turned the AC up to 78 F for now to see the effect on kW usage. Will update the post whenever I receive additional data."
"Interesting, I wonder if the AC could reach that level of usage given I was also moving furniture in and out. Heat from the outside environment could have triggered the AC to activate maybe.  

I actually was just looking at that killawatt tool, hoping itll bring about some sort of explanation.

I enjoy travelling and, occasionally, will host dinner parties.  Both, while joyful, tend to be rather expensive. Haha."
"Ahhh, I‚Äôve heard that one before. Not sure where you shop, because Kroger frequently has coupons for cheese, frozen and sometimes fresh produce (apples, lettuce and tomatoes right now, and I‚Äôm sure more), sour cream, yogurt, and even occasionally milk, and I could go on and on. "
"Right? I hate it. The only useful coupons to me are for cleaning supplies and hygiene stuff. I‚Äôd love coupons for produce and meat. 

Just noticed you said meat in your comment. Lol my grocery store doesn‚Äôt do coupons for meat at all, I wish they did"
"I am not one of those extreme couponers by any means. I just spend about an hour the day the Kroger Weekly Ad comes out, building a shopping list for the next week. Except for essentials I might need like flour, vegetable oil, etc. I don‚Äôt buy anything that isn‚Äôt in that ad, has a coupon or both. It‚Äôs nice because I like cooking and it forces me to be creative with what I made. The Kroger app is perfect because you can search for the product you want and it immediately tells you if there are any coupons for it. I load up all the coupons onto my card, do a quick check to see if there are any manufacturers coupons online for items that don‚Äôt have a store coupon (Kroger doesn‚Äôt let you stack), print them, and boom ready to go. Usually once I scan my Kroger card my total goes down at least $15, sometimes as much as $30. 

I‚Äôm on my own, so I don‚Äôt spend much in general. "
"I only use the weekly coupons I get in the paper, and I spend about an hour a week clipping and organizing. But I usually save about 40% on groceries. If you're the type of person that always gets the same items and brands then couponing might not be for you, but I use them to buy all the junky snacks and cereals my kids like, special treats like frozen pies and ice cream, and I save a ton on stuff like laundry detergent and toothpaste. I usually shop at Aldi for things I actually need that I can't coupon for. I've got my baseline prices (like I don't buy soda if it's more then 4-12 packs for $10 because I know that's a sale that stores seem to rotate a lot) I feel much more aware of prices and I know when something is actually a good deal regardless of if it's ""on sale"" or not. "
" Back in the latter part of the 70's my wife and I lived in L.A. and used to drive down to Mexico every 2-3 months. After we moved to Tennessee in 1980, we've never gone back. 

 The beaches were beautiful and I was always amazed by a plethora of goods at prices much lower than in California. In those days we always brought back a couple of bottles of Mescal. It was definitely better than anything sold in California.

 Enjoy your vacation. A frugal lifestyle at home helps make  trips like your's affordable. "
"Couponing is so hard! That‚Äôs the one thing I can‚Äôt get into, probably because i don‚Äôt have a printer or newspaper so I only have access to digital stuff and red plum. I don‚Äôt know how to stack or track things and it‚Äôs so weird. I usually just check out circulars, figure out which have the best combination of meal prep items etc. I‚Äôll usually hit at least two stores during grocery runs. I used a 20% off world market coupon during a 40% off sale and got some nice cups for a dollar a piece and it felt great. 

For non food home good type stuff I‚Äôll try clearance at TJ Ross type and hunt Craigslist/FB marketplace/Amazon until I find what I‚Äôm looking for at the price point I decided was what my challenge amount was. 
"
"I don‚Äôt eat too much dairy at home, but I‚Äôll have to check out places that offer coupons of produce. Nice, thanks!"
"Usually, it's processed meats that have a brand name, like Johnsonville."
"5-6 years ago was the peak: stores were still doubling coupons, you could use printed coupons with many restrictions, and stacking was much more capable back then.  Now no one doubles, printed coupons require some jumping through hoops to use, and you can rarely stack coupons.

I just shop at Aldi now.  I get consistent pricing and can make whatever I want each week."
Oh yeah that‚Äôs true. I wasn‚Äôt counting those lol
"A squeeze bottle from the dollar store. Looks just like the kind you would find ketchup in at a diner, but clear instead of red. I like to buy cooking oil in bulk, but I absolutely cannot stand pouring individual servings out of those giant bottles. Now I just keep refilling the squeeze bottle. It works perfectly!"
Electric toothbrush
"Not *hugely* uncommon, but a digital kitchen scale has been wonderful, and one of the better $12 I've spent. 

Either for baking by weight, actually measuring how much of what I'm eating, or weighing yarn to see how much I have left, it's been one of my most used doodads. "
A bidet. It was $12 on Amazon. 
"A glass pitcher with a top that strains tea. We drink pitchers of hibiscus regularly to help with blood pressure and it's just a blessing. We now have one brewing in the fridge at all times with the loose leaf teas and put in our bottles to keep a supply. We must drink 3-4 pitchers a day worth. It maybe cost 25$. When it's just plop the leaves in and add water then pour later? Easy to clean and had to get a second for other types of tea. We had maybe 30 bags of 1-4 lbs of tea from a close out but never made much of a dent a cup here and there. 

Edit: it cost less than I remembered, 16.99"
"My Instant pot. I bought it used on marketplace so saved quite a bit on purchase price. Lots of people got it because of the hype then got rid of it so look out if you want one. We eat a lot of rice and always have a rice cooker, the instant pot replaces that. Plus it does a lot more. It makes ribs so good and fast that we dont even find bbq places appealing any more:) plus stews, soups, and chilli are always great in terms of nutrition, taste, and cost."
I just bought a pineapple sliver/corer for $8 and I‚Äôm mad I didn‚Äôt buy one years ago. I end up wasting a lot less pineapple so it will be a money saver eventually. 
I smoke cigars and bought a couple of humidors for $79 or so. I then read about tupperdores and bought two of these for $14 each. They work great. Not much to look at but I'll take the savings over aesthetics.
"A good butcher knife ($80-120) it allows me to butcher large cuts of meat, and whole chickens easily which I can buy at lower prices. 
"
"I bought an electric griddle for $15 and it's been great for cooking breakfast, grilled cheese, tortillas and more for my family of 5. I would've never thought to get one since we have good pans, but I got one on sale as a Christmas gift for secret Santa at work and it was well received, so I decided to get one for myself. I'm not sure it's saved me any money, but it saves me tons of cooking time, and I have a backup plan along with the microwave if the stove goes out."
"I have a lot of things that fall into that category. For kitchen gadgets, a few that come to mind include a water filter, mini soda machine, and a programmable induction cooker. The first two are used together to make a cheap and healthy alternative to soda - just water and CO2. The third allows setting a temperature and time for cooking, so that it will automatically stop when done. Another contraption I really like is a slow cooker with a PID controller kit connected to it.

For tools, my top two picks would be a Radio Shack clamp multimeter and a cable tracer kit. (I also have a Mooshimeter but that's a little more than $100.) The cable tracer paid for itself the first time I used it - I had to find a loose connection in some wiring in the walls and I was able to find the problem in under 5 minutes.

For electronic gadgets (only including items that do not require a lot of technical knowledge to use), my top pick would be an Anker vertical mouse - much more comfortable than the regular kind."
"A cheap bidet. I think I find excuses to rave about our bidet every week in some thread or other on r/frugal, but man I love that thing. It was $30 on Amazon, took like 5 min to install on our toilet (don‚Äôt need to do anything crazy, pretty much just unscrew one tube and screw in the bidet tube). Now we almost never buy TP (we do keep rolls around for when guests come over so they‚Äôre not too freaked out, and I still use it for when I pee). But we go through so much less TP now, and we use the ‚Äúnice‚Äù stuff so I‚Äôm confident it‚Äôs paid for itself on a couple of months."
"Food processor: I hear a lot of people say they never get use out of one, but I use mine at least once per week. I love making my own homemade nut butters and hummus. I also use it to mash up beans, grate cheese and fresh coconut, dice up all kinds of veggies, make homemade frozen banana ice cream, etc.

Dehydrator: I love buying lots of fruits and veggies when they are cheap at the farmer's market and drying it to store for later use. I can also make homemade fruit roll ups and beef jerky with it.

Coffee grinder: I'm not a huge coffee drinker, but I use this for grinding up my dried fruits, nuts, and veggies to turn into a fine powder that I can sprinkle on or use in recipes."
"A friend gave me a tile, and now my keys and my phone are connected via Bluetooth. I can find my phone with my laptop, so it‚Äôs almost impossible for my to lose either for any length of time.

I also got a mug sized tea strainer basket with lid that means I can use loose leaf tea without a teapot. The strainer base fits in the lid upside down, so it doesn‚Äôt drip on the bench."
"My electric blanket was a great purchase. It allowed me to lower the electric in the winter. Even if I didn't save any money, the cozy, snuggly warmth was worth the $30 or so."
Mega Pro screwdriver. $20
"Keypad entry door lock (right around $100 with a 10% Lowe's discount). No more house keys! Although I did add a second one as a backup so now we're over $100.

Shop Vac. Laser printer. Really high-quality dustpan. Indoor clothesline for winter. These are a few of my favorite things!"
"Magnets, magnets and more verity of magnets. "
Jordana black leather Cat Eye liner! It's about $4 on Amazon. And the best wing eyeliner I've ever used! 
One of those magnet things you attach to the vent in your car that holds your phone. About $10 on Prime Day. Makes it way safer to use GPS in your car and convenient to grab if you get a call. 
"Vena magnetic cellphone case with card holder. Less than $20 from amazon. I can leave my house with just keys and cellphone at anytime. Easy to mount on my car phone holder, durable and protects your phone from drops so well. "
My Ninja food processor/blender/spiralizer. I drink a lot of smoothies and use the food processor a ton and this is the only machine that has not been killed by me. I've had it for years and it works as well as the first day.
"A hand blender.  Don't remember how much I paid ($50 maybe?), but I've had it for 16 years, and it's still going strong.  I use it for fruit smoothies, for blending soup, mixing mayonnaise, etc.  "
"A small clothes brush -- it takes out most spots so I don't have to dry clean or wash clothing as often.  I primarily got it to sweep fur off my clothes, but it's so much more useful."
I second the instant pot. I use it for meal prepping and it is many kitchen tools in one so it saves kitchen space. The second thing is my French press. I save counter space and money on coffee. It also is a milk frother and I use it for brewing loose leaf tea. 
"Rice cooker - cost about $20 and maks it so much easier to cook something quickly at home. You know how easy it is to cook rice with a pot on the stove? The rice cooker makes that look like preparing souffl√©. 

Pop-socket for my phone, cost maybe 5 bucks. After replacing the screen three times its nice to have something more solid to grip on to. "
We got a little plastic flask-like container with a big pipette (saw it on Good Eats with Alton Brown) and we keep that next to the stove. It‚Äôs SO nice for quickly throwing on just a TBSP of oil without dumping the whole giant bulk bottle
"I've always seen them in cooking shows on TV now I know where to get them, thanks! "
Great idea! I just did this and it makes me feel like I‚Äôm on a cooking show. 
For me I buy the squeeze bottle of jelly jam and buy cheaper large jars for refill after. Saves a bunch of $$$
Also great for putting food grade diatomaceous earth in (Or boric acid) and use to dust the cracks.   
"On that note, a USB-charging vibrator. I'll never buy batteries again."
Same. I use mine to help me count calories and it makes it so easy. I wouldn‚Äôt have lost 50lbs without it.
Yeah even if you don't use daily you will need it atlease a few times a year. 
"Mine was a ""fancy"" $45 one that has a nozzle cleaning setting. I got an email from the company that said if I posted an unbiased review on Amazon, they would send me a second one. I did and they did. I got 2 for the price of one. Gave one to my in-laws and now I have a second place to poop like a king. Love it."
Holy smokes my family would love this.
We love instant pot ribs. What recipe are you using?  
Haha I got one but lost it. Pineapple was on sale for $1.25 for a whole month here in Florida... Really burns my mouth eating so much... Freezing them up for hot summer days is the best...
"I've been debating on whether or not to get a pineapple corer, and I happened to find this video today: https://youtu.be/MKjXLk8PJUI

I'm going to save ~$10 and cut it this way from now on! =)"
Victorinox ftw! 45$ on Amazon and one of the best purchases I've made.
A good knife is for sure worth every penny. 
Nice. I got myself a breakfast sandwich maker that can also poach eggs. Ate a bunch of ham egg cheese bagel sandwiches for a while. 
Interesting with the wire tracer. My brother have a many switches and have no idea what some of them operate. With the soda machine can you make rootbeet?
Haha I got a plush heated bed cover. Couldn't even feel the wires. Was amazing while I lived up north. 
Your cat is one lucky feline. 
User name checks out.
How would those be on strength in the vibrations? Need to find a small one that is strong.
What do you use to dry up? I'd imagine normal tp doesn't cut it
"Such a good damn knife, use it almost daily"
Lol smart alek. Best cheap makeup I've ever spent money on that isn't cheap.
"You'll never go back to batteries. Any quality one like Fun Factory, Lelo, Evolved, etc. will be more powerful and cost less money in the long run than battery op. Source: used to work at a sex shop. "

That is excellent. Thank you!
"Why are you starting with the assumption you need a new car?

If you buy a car that is 2 years older, its like a 70% off coupon."
"DIY repair is a large advantage to gas powered imo. Hybrid's I can imagine being a large headache. I live in a smaller area (Wi) but from what I can tell, only dealers will service hybrids primarily. My friend currently has one and has regretted his decision. 

Up front cost is higher, they are significantly heavier vehicles, seem more less reliable if you live in a northern state where it gets cold, infrastructure isn't exactly all there for hybrids either.

Also depends on how long you expect the car to last. Battery longevity is a gray area as of now. If you're one of those people who get a new car every 5 years, I would strongly recommend a gas powered counterpart. "
"You're missing a couple things. A lot of shops won't want to work with hybrids or they will charge more. You have to account for replacing your battery in 10 years or so. There's a lot of learning involved as an owner with a hybrid so its something some people don't like to deal with. Also if there's a lot of hybrids around, things might be better for you. I live in LA where there's a lot of prius so its not that much more expensive but I can imagine it being harder in places where people don't drive hybrids. "
Look into the Kia Nero my brother has one loves it there very inexpensive rated super high by all the consumer report folks
2 year old Rav4‚Äôs don‚Äôt cost 30% of the price of new ones.
"Not a RAV4, but I have a Prius. I do most of my own work on it. Mine is currently sitting at 96xxx and I'm about to change the engine and inverter coolant. I haven't had any battery issues and if I do, i can replace them myself. Just like any other car, you don't wanna have to work on the transmission or take out the engine, most everything else is pretty doable DIY.

As far as infrastructure, I'm not sure what is needed. Just a gas station, it's a hybrid, it doesn't need to plug in to charge.

As far as frugality, when my ex and I bought a camry, we got the hybrid version. We took the gas prices at the time mutliplied by the miles we drive in a year. Then divided that by 12. Then compared that to the difference in the payment. At the time, gas was around $4/gal and it came out significantly cheaper to buy the hybrid."
I‚Äôm not someone who has the time or inclination to repair their own vehicle. Not sure this would be a disadvantage for me.

"If you look at 10 year failure rates for Toyota cars, they are extremely low. Same cannot be said for Honda or other brands."
"What shop have you gone to that‚Äôs like ‚Äúoh no, that thing is a hybrid, take your money somewhere else!‚Äù

What are you having work done on that makes it impossible since it‚Äôs a hybrid? 

What learning curve is there for a hybrid? You literally drive it exactly the same as a regular car, because it‚Äôs a regular car. "
"Okay, looked it up 10,000 dollars less than new.

What's your goal?"
I dont recommend changing the hybrid battery UNLESS YOU KNOW HOW. They can be extremely dangerous. Good on you for knowing how though
"That might be even worse then, you will pay a premium to repair it. 

I saw from your other comment you bought a 2016 RAV4, any real reason to upgrade? "
"I had to replace mine at 11 years. Also if you don't use your car for a couple of weeks, the battery can deteriorate faster. "
"I had that happen to me when I asked a shop if they could replace my light bulb. If you don't want to deal with something and you know someone else can do it, why wouldn't you say go here instead?"
"This hasn't been my experience. Bought a 2016 RAV4 for $22,000 pretax. KBB value today is $20,000. I got it for $7,000 off MSRP. Nobody pays MSRP and most get for $5,000 to $6,000 off MSRP. Not sure how you are getting your $10,000 number.

Not sure why I'm getting downvoted, but these are the real numbers. Basing an analysis off of MSRP doesn't make any sense to me."
"Dude, that doesn‚Äôt make sense. 

Buy the hybrid. My wife hated the idea of a hybrid but we bought it anyways and if she hated it, she could have my car.  Now that she regularly cranks our 44mpg she won‚Äôt let me touch the thing. They also really deck out the hybrid models with great technology too. I‚Äôm jealous of her car and will only be buying hybrids from now on.

Oh, and look up long term cost of maintenance comparison for brands. Toyota is out in front followed by Honda. The battery issues of old are just that - old issues. "
"You are correct, if you are negotiating well you can get a good deal. Its also important that the car you are looking at has a good resale value.

I picked up a new car a few years ago for the same price as 3 year old uses car. Same model.

Why new? Highest safety rating and fixed price service for 5 years. Plus mandatory free insurance for a year. "
Hmm I was thinking about my next car being a hybrid - I‚Äôve got a 2010 Yaris that I‚Äôm not planning on changing but you know the mind wanders. But my bf was telling me that the high cost of hybrids aren‚Äôt offset my gas savings for many years. What‚Äôs your take? Do you really think you save that much gas to justify the high price? 
"High cost? I dunno about that, look at a used Prius or something. You can pay like $12,500 for a car that‚Äôs going to last you 150k more miles.  My wife‚Äôs civic was the loaner car for the dealership. It was less than 2 years old and had 1,100 miles on it when we bought it. I think we paid 15k a year ago. She‚Äôs driven it 25k miles for her job and averages 44mpg combined city/highway. 

I don‚Äôt think 15k is a ton for a nice reliable car, hybrid or not."
"Haha I‚Äôm a student so 15k is a chunk of change for me. But you‚Äôre probably right, it‚Äôs not that much all things considered. The stars all aligned for my car, the small dealership owner gave it to me to pay off 6 months 0% interest so my little Yaris is my baby. I love that car, and the gas mileage is decent. I don‚Äôt know much about how much it racks up but it‚Äôs not terribly painful to tank it. Thanks for the advice :)"
"Someone there said it best, ""When your frugal decisions are coming at the cost of others, you're being cheapskate.""  Example, giving a smaller tip at a restaurant to save money."
"It should never, they are different philosophies.

Being Frugal is not NOT spending money it is spending money wisely.

Being cheap is avoiding spending money at all costs. "
"Cheap? Using a coupon on the first date. Frugal using coupons on every following date üòÇ

As another poster said cheap is looking at short term, and that's spot on. For example, buying a knife from the dollar store that'll go dull, bend, and fall apart is being cheap. Buying a high end knife on sale and with a coupon that'll last years (maybe decades) is being frugal. 

Being cheap means you're willing to greatly sacrifice quality. Being frugal is getting quality at an amazing price."
I wonder how many people in this subreddit will admit to being cheapskates. 
The definition of frugal distinguishes it from cheap in that it considers the long term while cheap often only considers the short term.
when it means you end up smelling some variation of bad. 
When what you're buying is for someone else. 
"If you're frugal, your life should be enhanced. You optimize your finances to try to get what you want out of life, have some savings, etc. If you're cheap, your life will be less enjoyable, the things you own will be junk that make you miserable to use, and you may even offend people around you by your choices (such as not tipping waiters, which everyone mentions for some reason). "
"Frugal doesn't mean ""cheap"" but efficient. Two examples of this efficiency:

* Buying a diamond ring is ALWAYS stupid. No matter how cheap you got it, it's still a overpriced stupid useless rock. 

* Buying bad quality shoes is never frugal, no matter if you buy a container of those for a dollar, it's still bad investment because those can hurt your feet and are unreliable. 

"
when you buy a Ferrari instead of a Rolls Royce. plebs. 
Drinking oil for meals cause it's cheaper then real food. 
"Self abuse however is ok!

...right? "
"If you are eating at a restaurant, you arent being cheap.

This would be more stupidity than anything. "
"Me and my wife had our first date at a mall. Instead of doing the typical restaurant movie, I told her those were gigantic wastes and I wanted to get her something useful. 

Took her to a store I liked for the prices and tried on some clothes. 10 dollars later, she had her favorite shirt until it finally fell apart years later.

IMO, get these things out of the way quickly. Maybe second date is more socially acceptable in your late 20s, but we were 19 and I was not going to be with someone who wanted petty luxuries. "
"Re the date thing I'd say it's the other way round .  1st date ""where do you fancy?"" ""don't mind...x type of food?"" ""oh well I have a coupon for y could go there""   Anniversary date ""where do you fancy ?""  ""ooh I really want to try this new place""  "" no I  don't have a coupon for there ""  "
"I tell people that I'm going to be cheap before I do anything cheap. 

People are quite understanding of wanting to save money and almost have an appreciation for it.
"
I think that's the point. The frugal person would save by eating at home. The cheap person goes to a restaurant but orders the cheap meal (whether they like it or not) and then stiff the waitress on the tip.
"Your vehicle has to be new-ish. Like no older than three years or something like that. Just fyi

Imo not worth the wear and tear on your car, frustration from bad passengers, and increased potential of a car accident (being on the road more often).

If u really still wanna do it, consider uber eats. I think it's easier with the same pay. Don't quote me on that."
I‚Äôd never do it because of the liability. $2500 deductible if an accident happens. Ick.
See [this.](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/03/02/590168381/uber-lyft-drivers-earning-a-median-profit-of-3-37-per-hour-study-says) 
You can probably cut down the phone bill by a lot.
/r/UberDrivers can help
"What city are you in? Some cities have healthy markets and others are total trash, post your per mile and per minute rates too.  
It's summer time though, which beats up most markets that aren't regulated by the additional entry barrier of needing to get a taxi license.  Ask your friends  for anyone who has tried Ube driving before and get their referral code, in my city the referral bonus is $250 after twenty trips, so imo it's worth it just for the referral bonus.    
      
Last thing is that vehicle requirements vary by state, so don't listen to anyone here about requirements. In NYC I'm driving a 2010 salavaged vehicle."
"Also, I recommend Rover (pet walking/sitting app) for anyone looking for a side gig in which you need flexibility. IF you have it in your city that is. "
"From my own experience:

It is worth it for some quick money using a referral code from someone. When I did Lyft, I got on a promotion where after 50 rides in a month, I got $500 on top of everything I would normally make. This made it worth it for me and I think with promotions like that, driving for a month or two is worth it.

Otherwise, the cost of all the fees that Uber/Lyft take out of your rides, the cost of gas, oil changes, tire wear, car repairs, cleanings, etc all add up and you really make barely minimum wage. Additionally, you have a lot more liability than other jobs since your car can be damaged and you can be sued. 

Other problems include: 1) Making serious money on Uber requires working a lot, which can definitely cause health problems from sitting so much 2) The most money is made during rush hours and late nights which are probably when you'll be studying, sleeping, or relaxing with friends

Overall, my recommendation from experience is work enough to get your referral bonus and then quit while you're ahead. Hopefully by then you've found a better side gig. "
"**Tip:** For the drunks who vomit.  Put some plastic tarp on the floor of the front and back seat, plus a bucket/pail within easy reach of the passenger.  

In the trunk, keep extra tarp and replacement bucket, plastic bags to wrap the bucket, cleaning rags and bleach-based cleaner (e.g. Clorox-based in spray bottle).  

So you can quickly clean up after an incident and go back to driving."
"lyft pays better but has less mindshare. uber has more mindshare but treats their drivers less well. 

your car has to be relatively new *period* (not just to get better tips). 

get your family a better mobile carrier. $300/month is absurd for a mobile bill!"
"Agree with this. I've done Uber. I hated driving around drunk people and putting on all that mileage on my car. I did Postmates for a little while (basically Uber Eats but another company if you haven't heard of it). Only didn't do it long because I got a better side gig, but I enjoyed it while it lasted. It was a lot easier than Uber."
"I have yet to see an accurate assessment of the cost/benefit of uber. Unfortunately this study was flawed and the calculations were not correct (see the notes at the top of the article). I think the reason is because not everyone is in the same position and you cannot assume that maintenance cost will be this, depreciation will be that etc. If OP already owns the car, then OP will already be doing maintenance on the car, paying for insurance, gas, etc. OP would need to sit down and do the math (what would be the net difference in insurance cost, maintenance, depreciation, to determine if this would be worth it). In my city, we have something called Maven which actually covers the cost of gas, maintenance, and insurance, and the rental of a new vehicle for one week that you can use to do Uber in. The price is around $200.00 per week. There are tons of different ways to do Uber, I wouldn't necessarily just write it off and say ""it's a rip-off"" "
What was the better side gig if you dont mind my asking?
"I don‚Äôt mind! I‚Äôm a Rover dog walker/pet sitter. Pays really well and is 100% based on what I want to do and when I want to do it. Plus, animals are way better than hauling humans around IMO."
"Being frugal isn't necessarily about being cheap. Good job man! Enjoy it, you scrimped elsewhere, you earned that tv. Also great deal!! "
"Damn. $280 for a 55""? I paid $1000 for a 65"" samsung."
"Hell yeah, you know it. Thank you!"
"You most certainly got a better quality TV! This TV only plays 1080p, and is not a smart TV. 

I decided I didn‚Äôt need 4K because nothing I watch can be played in 4K with the exception of Netflix so it was a wasted feature. And I don‚Äôt need a smart TV because the firestick does all that. Still I‚Äôd take that Samsung any day! "
"Ouch. And it was samsung.

I have avoided that company like the plague. They have a massive marketing presence on reddit, wayyy too much advertising, and low quality products across the board.

"
yeah. 4k is useless. get a $40 fire stick instead of paying for a smart tv. I don't use smartv features either. I guess I overpaid. I wanted a nice screen though.
"We have 3 samsung tvs in our house that are almost 10 years old.  I don't know the current samsung quality, but those tvs have been great.  Never one issue.  We also have samsung washer and dryer for 3 years now and they've been great too.  "
"For 1080p, get a Raspberry Pi 3+. The community support is unmatchable - even the original is still well supported! Or use a PC - even an older one will work as 1080p is not very demanding.

I opted for 4K since I can use the large screen area for multitasking. Also note that a lot of content creators are upgrading to 4K nowadays."
"I use a French press, put about 1/2 cup of homegroubd coffee and lukewarm water. I cover it with plastic and put on my counter for 8 hrs and in the fridge for 8 hours. It's perfect for me, but depending on how strong you like your coffee you may want to put less ground coffee. "
I do like a cup or a cup and a half of grounds in a half gallon pitcher. Then put in the fridge for 12-18 hours. I filter into a bowl with a paper towel and a mesh strainer. It's a bit ghetto but it makes decent cold brew.
"You can also brew a pot of coffee, pour it into an ice try and freeze it, then use those frozen coffee cubes as your ice so that the coffee doesn‚Äôt get watered down as it cools."
"The whole cheese cloth thing was hard for me, plus It  as annoying to rinse it and reuse and then you can only reuse so many times and it‚Äôs expensive. I use some cold brew/tea infusers [got on amazon but had to remove the link due to the rules ?] going strong and looking brand new still after 10 months. Fits in the big mason jars and the lid fits over that. 

I fill the whole thing with ground beans, put into jar and then slowly pour water water in to fill jar. It makes the coffee really strong so when I pour into my coffee cup I water it down some. I make 2 jars at a time which lasts me about 8 or 9 days. "
"The oxo cold brew coffee brewer, while it does nothing fancy has made it so much easier for us to make our concentrate.  No dealing with cheesecloth, paper filters and strainers.  I think I paid ~35ish but the ease of using and cleaning it made it much easier to follow through on making our coffee at home"
Instant coffee makes the best ice coffee.
"i put them into mason jars to brew, then i use a french press to filter out the grounds.  "
"I made a giant reusable tea bag-like container out of a cotton shirt to hold my coffee grounds. Skips the step of straining! When it's done, I throw the cotton ""coffee bag"" in the wash and voila! Just in time to make another concentrated batch of cold brew :)"
Pretty sure that makes a concentrate.  You may want to dilute it to 1 or 2 parts water before serving.
Does it brew better at room temp first? I've made it in a French press before but always put it right into the fridge. Wondering if it would come out better if I tried your method!
I use a colander on top of a mixing bowl with a paper filter to filter the grounds out.  
"If you have a Mr. Coffee style coffee maker, you can drain your cold brew through it. Leave the lid open, and pour the cold brew directly into the filter basket. "
The nylon nut milk bags work well for cold brew too. 
"I do both to ensure it is bolder. Try it out and see, I find it does brew better at room temp first. "
"Hi there!

A couple of suggestions: 1) Facebook Marketplace is amazing. I've gotten much better quality items than I would have been able to afford on my own. If you have to haul something and you don't have a friend with a truck, Home Depot will rent you one for $19 for 75 minutes. There's a $50 refundable deposit and you need to replace any gas you use, but I've done this and it's been great.

2) My desk is a table from IKEA, and I love it. I'm a freelance consultant working from home, so I like/need a lot of space. It's about 4 feet long, more than enough for laptop, 23 inch external monitor, lamp, etc. I spent less than $100 on this and I've had it for 5 years now. The legs screw off for easy moving. I am sure you could spend even less than I did, just search for tables instead of desks. That variance in verbiage seems to affect the price :)

3) I didn't even own a dresser until I was like 35. Honestly, you'd be fine without one, I would think. Just get some fabric storage cubes and if you want, splurge on a $30 cube organizer to put them in. Looks nice, totally doable option, and easily resold when you want to move. Facebook Marketplace always has these up for sale, and bonus, someone already had to put it together for you! :)

4) If you don't mind my saying, don't worry about what your roommate thinks about your situation or setup. Chances are, she or he notices a lot less than you think they do :)

Best of luck!"
"Do you already have a mattress? If not, that's going to be your biggest expense. Hopefully someone here can offer some advice. 

I slept on a decent mattress on the floor for a year or two. Still a fine night's sleep with none of the expense of a bed frame or box spring. 

You can get perfectly functional dressers in all shapes, sizes, and styles for <$100 on Craigslist. There are hundreds on the CL here, so I expect a college town to be the same (or better). Find something you like well enough that's in pretty good shape and you're all set.

Used desks seem to sell for a bit more. To the point where it's a toss up whether a decent used desk or one of the affordable options at Ikea is a better move."
"My suggestions would be:

* **Desk:** IKEA Linnmon table top & Adils legs (currently on sale for $5.99 + 4x$3.50 = $19.99) (I own this, it's awesome!)
* **Dresser:** IKEA Rast 3-drawer chest, $39.99 (maybe 2, depending on how much space you need)
* **Bed:** Walmart ""Zinus-14-Metal-Platform-Bed-Multiple-Sizes"", $79   
 I chose this bed because it has wooden slats, which are WAY better for a mattress than steel, plastic etc., for an excellent price and great reviews.
* **Mattress:** It's hard to tell what type of a mattress you need without knowing your sleeping habits, but I recommend you to check out the following mattresses:
  * Spring mattress, Amazon, B079DMS4Y9, $79 (probably the most comfortable for back sleepers)
  * Gel mattress, Amazon, B01NBPG153, $127
  * Foam & spring mattress, Amazon, B01IU6RN9G, $142  

I am a side sleeper and have found foam and gel mattresses to be the most comfortable for me. You may find this guide: sleepopolis.com/guides/mattress-firmness-guide helpful. In general, you probably want to spend the most on a mattress and decent bed base (the best mattress will be bad without a proper base) because you will spend up to a third of your day in bed (compared to using the dresser or desk). 

The **total** would come to $138.98 + mattress (e.g. $217/ $265 / $280), so **UNDER $300!** :)


*edited to add:* If you don't have a closet and need a lot of space for clothes, it might be worth buying a wardrobe rather than a dresser. The IKEA Bygstad wardrobe is $99, the Brimnes $129. They will offer a lot more space than a dresser. Other than that, a simple clothes rack (IKEA Rigga costs $13) might do, too. "
"Find a housing district full of college students. Their leases are expiring around now and when they move, they throw away everything because they have no idea what it is or don't care. I've found two full grain leather couches, four desks, two office chairs, a La-Z-Boy recliner, a sturdy maple dining table with 3 chairs, a Traeger smoker, a working PS3, cast iron skillets, and so much more laying next to dumpsters. Sure they aren't in the greatest shape but cleaning anything is cheaper than buying it. "
"You can get a wardrobe to hang clothes at ikea with prices starting at 13 bucks. you can take it apart and take it with you.  a desk is just a flat surface on legs, so anything could fit that bill, even a small table. I would prioritize a good bed since you are going to be working a lot. Also a factor is how much room you have and whether you can move large items, like a desk from the habitat for humanity restore, or whether assembly furniture would be better."
"Craigslist, thrift shop, eBay, Walmart."
I just got six or 8 cinder blocks and a piece of plywood the same size as the mattress to set on top. Now your bed is off the ground and you have some storage underneath.
Salvation Army or Goodwill have lots of great furniture! 
Thrift stores have a lot of furniture.  Also check Craigslist for garage sales in the area (my town does townwide garage sales in May and October).
"In addition to the other suggestions here, try habitat for humanity restores"
"Are you trying to potentially turn a profit at the end if the year by selling these items or hoping to take them with you? Or just looking to get the cheapest option and dump it at the end? Edit: also, are you in the US?"
"Use plastic office drawer bins for a dresser should be $60ish

Use a folding table with another smaller plastic office thing $25+25=$50ish

Futon from Walmart or something just get decent hangdown sheets and it wont look bad $200ish

=$310ish"
"Look for a dining table from ikea as a desk, i bought a plain black rectangular one for 40 dollars and it has been fantastic. 

Amazon could yield good options for an office chair, or facebook marketplace.

I bought the Lucid mattress on amazon and its great but the Zinus is cheaper and ive heard tons of people say its just as good. Consider getting a smaller size to save money.

Buy one of the raw wood bed frames from ikea, theyre incredibly cheap and super functional. 

Ikea is best for a lamp, bedside table (they have a few options under 20, even a stool would work short term) 

For bedding, winners/marshalls/homesense style stores are best, i found a set of cotton sheets for 30 dollars. 

Thrift stores are great, walmart too."
"Do you have Kijiji or Craigslist in your area?

I got my current bed for free because I took over the lease of a girl moving in with her boyfriend. But at my old apartment I had bought a used mattress for $30 from kijiji (and bought a mattress cover cuz germs) and my place came with the bed frame.

I got my desk on Kijiji for $25 and the person delivered too! I basically emailed every ad I saw and offered them lower than their asking price until someone bit. Same story for my dresser (oftentimes they‚Äôre just selling because they want to get rid of them)."
"I like to stake out Targets furniture department. If someone bought something online and it had to be repackaged or they don‚Äôt sell it in stores when they return it it‚Äôs a generally put on clearance a minimum of 30% off but normally around 50%. I got a desk and coffee table for $45 total, the desk on sale $30 from $70 and table $15 from $40. It‚Äôs hit or miss but sometimes you can strike gold. "
"If there's an Ikea near you and you can handle a twin bed you can easily meet your budget or below if you're willing to sacrifice some comfort.

Edit: $40 for a bedframe, $150 for the slightly better mattress, small dresser for $40, and you can also get a small desk or a cheap tabletop and legs for $40 too."
"Do you have a closet at all?  I tend to hang everything... skirts, pants, shorts, T-shirt‚Äôs, blouses, scarves...hangers are cheap. Get a hanging organizer to put socks and stuff in, and maybe an over the door clear shoe holder for other little stuff. All easily breaks down and transports in a minimal amount of space!"
"I second the Ikea desk! I did the same thing and it cost all of $50; $30 for the top and $4 each for the legs plus tax. It's a huge 30"" x 60"" desk top, and they have smaller sizes too for less $ if you can work with a smaller desk. "
"Some thrift stores sell mattresses. The big stores don't actually resell the ones returned under the ""60 day trial, no hassle returns"" policies.  They send them to thrift stores.  It's a good way to get a cheap mattress that has been steam cleaned and is guaranteed free of bugs. "
"Using the dressers x2 as side tables would be good too, kill two birds with one stone."
"I like this, truly frugal and some ""outside of the box"" thinking.  

Now, she did say she might be embarrassed about what her roommate might think, so I would advise getting a sheet larger than the bed to place on top of the plywood, to use as a bed skirt. That way the cinder blocks and plywood are hidden and it just looks like a normal bed frame.  Then you put your mattress on top and viola!"
"If you're not trying to bring hookups back to your place and want to make the most of a small space, I'd couple [this option](https://m.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/spr/09268768/) with the user above's suggestion of ditching a dresser and using cute storage cubes. Twins may not be glamorous, but they get you through. A benefit to this option too is that you wouldn't need to buy a boxspring, just a cheap mattress. I would only recommend this option if you were not planning on taking the furniture with you, but can guarantee you'd be able to resell for at least $100 at the end of the year. "
Yea! I‚Äôve seen these at ark and goodwill. 
That's a fabulous idea! The Rast drawer is just as high as the legs and as wide as the table top! 
"Don't buy too much ahead of time. Save money to buy stuff once you're in there and have a better understanding of your needs and storage space.

In general, buying ahead of time for a new experience almost never saves you money. You end up wasting it on things you didn't need. "
"I spent maybe $200-250 (I just finished my first year of college), but I wasn't being particularly careful about expenses since (a) it was on my parents' credit card (I was sixteen at the time and since my job paid only $11/hour, they agreed to foot the bill) and (b) I have a merit-based full ride, including room and board, tuition, textbooks, and class fees, so it made sense that I could splurge a little on room d√©cor. 

I also wanted new things (towels, blanket, hangers, curtains, pillows) because they made my room feel more like my own place and less like my parents' house. I bought some organizational bins to keep my desk neat, as well as a portable vacuum and a couple other ""luxuries"" found at good prices at Walmart. "
"When I lived in the dorm I didn‚Äôt have a whole lot of space but all I brought were my clothes, laundry stuff(hamper, hangers), hygiene stuff(toothbrush, razor,etc), bedding, a personal lamp(used it while roommate slept) my laptop, a plate, a mug, and like pencils and notebooks. I also had a dining hall so I didn‚Äôt have to cook or anything in my room, although my roommate did have a microwave and a mini fridge but I didn‚Äôt have to really use it. I think those are the basics, some people like to bring decorations or hobby items like a guitar or something. You could also get organizational items but I haven‚Äôt used them personally, but I‚Äôm a disorganized person so you might actually use them more effectively. Everything I brought I pretty much had from home, if you can just go over the items you use in a weekly routine(from when you wake up to sleep) and bring those from home, that way there is less of a chance of you missing something. Take that list and narrow it down, cut luxury items or items that you won‚Äôt need in college. You‚Äôll end up with a list of pretty much everything that you actually use in life and won‚Äôt buy things you‚Äôll never use. "
dollar tree. and if you dont have a printer yet. buy a laser printer. you will be able to pick one up for under 50 bucks and will/should last you 4 years
Agreed!
"I'm not sure, but my roommates and I ""collected"" many things our first year.  One roomie's boyfriend made us shelves for our desks from scrap wood and we used a spool for electrical wire as a table after we put a tablecloth (old sheet) on it.  Two of us split the cost of a humidifier that I still use today.  I also still use the Ziplock microwavable, freezer-safe dishes that I purchased back then.  We didn't have a dining hall so my grandmother gave me two of her pots and my mother gave me an old skillet and some utensils."
"One thing I will suggest, if you have a very good knowledge of IT and are interested in crypto mining, is to be on the lookout for old servers and workstations going for super cheap or free. Think of it as a fun way to invest that also has other uses. Don't get too many (just one or two would be a good start) and don't spend too much for them - calculate the mining profit and it should break even in a few months or less. Also keep in mind to only get hardware that runs quiet enough to use in a dorm or can be easily configured for quietness.

That's one of the few things I can recommend getting a little bit ahead of time, but only if you can score a very good deal for them. It helps that the older stuff that is not popular with most members of /r/homelab due to high power usage would be perfectly fine for those who pay a fixed rate.

I personally brought two Pentium 4s and an Athlon 64 when I went to college, all running Folding@Home. (Sadly, that was well before Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency existed.) Besides helping find cures for cancer, the setup was useful for just playing around with and learning IP networking."
"Oh, I‚Äôve visited the actual room that I‚Äôm staying in. I‚Äôm bringing half of the stuff that I‚Äôll need and my roommate is bringing the other half. I decided to get cleaning supplies, dishes, detergent, and things like that. I‚Äôve been couponing and last year I bought a bunch of school supplies on sale so I won‚Äôt need anything like that either (I found my receipts and included this in the $60 I‚Äôve spent as well). "
"Praise be to the Dollar Tree. Somehow, I still have some of the stuff I bought there from my dorm days."
"That's awesome, don't get me wrong. But you and your roommate may not use all the stuff you've bought. That's why I was suggesting you wait. 

To me frugality isn't just about getting things for less, it's about figuring out just how little you need, then carefully selecting what you purchase in addition to the most basic things. When you're cramped in a room with someone, having extra stuff can be frustrating."
Dollar tree is the best. Cleaning supplies are cheap. They have perfect travel size meds. They are great for refilling the first aide kit. They have a books. They have school stuff like poster board and foam board. And on and on and on. Best thing is nothing is over a buck
"Yeah, I definitely agree. At the same time I feel like it‚Äôs good for me to get deals on stuff that I‚Äôm going to need anyways? Idk school is in a month and right now I have plenty of time to coupon and when I‚Äôm in school I doubt I‚Äôll have time. "
Tmobile is way cheaper for better service. 
"T-mobile is giving a 50% military discount right now, go get that before they stop lol.

Like, we pay $65 for 2 lines. It‚Äôs nonsense how cheap it is with the military discount."
"Your brother in the military can almost certainly get a military-only deal from AT&T that's better than this.

Going prepaid on his line (if he's abroad) might create problems since many prepaid services have limitations outside the US. "
"Get an unlimited prepaid account with autopay. I pay around $45 a month for unlimited everything through ATT. I also bought a cheap/decent smart phone from walmart. Piece of advice for the frugal community, a lot of services like tv/phone/internet will give you a discount if you autopay your stuff. ATT, for example, gives you $10 a month off your bill. If you can get 3 or 4 services that do that, your $45 phone bill is now only $5, relatively. Just a thought. "
What about metro or cricket? One of the shitty ones. 
"So, what else are you paying for on your account? There‚Äôs no way unlimited alone is $250. Did you finance devices, do you have insurance or other services billed to your account? "
/r/nocontract
"Just an FYI for everyone happy with their T-Mobile+military discount...

They are not supposed to charge a fee when you have to cancel a contract because you move to an area without their service. When we moved to Germany they charged the fee to our account...but we had no way to contact them to have the fee removed. I finally spent $40 on a international phone call, and they placed me on hold so many times I got disconnected twice. It‚Äôs been 6 years and that debt still shows in our credit history b/c we did not have access to the tools needed to provide the kind of proof they wanted. They wanted a fax only and would not accept a mailed or emailed/scanned copy of orders. We didn‚Äôt have access to a fax machine when we first arrived and by the time we found a place (combo of needing to get a vehicle, license, registered, get our bearings, etc) that would let us fax to the US T-Mobile had already turned us over to a collection agency. When I tried to use the chat feature on their website to get further help with it...I couldn‚Äôt b/c I was outside the US. They just made it such a freaking hassle and it never got resolved. "
"What I do is verizon prepaid. $200 to buy the phone outright, with $40 a month on cell service. Then pay for internet service at your house so you're data usage will go down. "
"A ""Thank you"" to your brother for his service."
"Cricket. Uses AT&T network. Costs me $70 per month for two lines with unlimited data. Bring your own device, but you can buy phones there. I bought a ""last year's"" model about 3 years ago for $10."
We switched to Sprint because AT&T was just too much but I will tell ya that we notice a big difference in quality of service as far as signal but it‚Äôs nothing we can‚Äôt live with for the savings. Another thing that sucks about Sprint is that you can‚Äôt use the internet while on a call.  I hope this helps. 
Get the tmobile one plan. 2 lines for $120 with taxes and fees included when using auto pay. Unlimited everything but you get your data throttle after using 50gb per line. Also include free Netflix. It get way cheaper if you can also get military discount.
I use mint sim. I just purchased 6 months 2gb data per month for $108. [https://www.prepaidphonenews.com/2018/05/mint-sim-is-now-mint-mobile.html](https://www.prepaidphonenews.com/2018/05/mint-sim-is-now-mint-mobile.html) You can do 6 months with 10 gs of data for $180 or for $300 for a year. You can also look into how to minimize data usage. Apps like Snapchat and Youtube use a lot of data. Consider telling your brother to check his data usage settings to help identify what is worth using data for.
are you making payments for the phones themselves too?
Straight Talk. I have had it for 3 years and it doesn't seem spotty to me. 
"T-Mobile is marginally cheaper (barring availability of the Military discount) for mediocre service mostly with better service occasionally is what you mean. 

OP needs to look at his bill and figure out what he‚Äôs paying for. There is no way 2 bare lines of service, regardless of plan is over $200. He has to have financed phones, insurance, or other goodies that would apply all the same to a T-Mobile account. "
And coverage has been getting much better the last couple years. At least in the PNW.
Agree 100&#37;. We pay $20.50 per line for our family military plan. We live in disparate places but all get great service. 
You also get free netflix too!
"Can you help me understand a few things? I‚Äôd like to try this. Are you paying ~$45 after all fees? Is that after autopay discount? 

I currently pay ~$65, and I like my grandfathered in included HBO, but my understanding is I can get a separate HBO Go for $9.99/mo and still save $10 a month,‚Äù."
"They have incredibly spotty service. Not ideal for my brother who is all over the country. 

I‚Äôll admit I‚Äôm being spoiled. I really would like solid coverage but down want to pay out the nose for it. "
"You go into a store with the orders. They insert a cancellation date in the future and wave the term fee if you had one. You call in and explain ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre moving due to a deployment what do you need to cancel our service with no fee?‚Äù And let them explain to you the process to have it organized before you‚Äôve left. 

Yeah, your situation sucks. And I‚Äôm sorry it happened to you. But not having your affairs in order before a deployment isn‚Äôt T-Mobiles responsibility. I hate victim blaming but personal accountability needs to begin somewhere. You can still easily have this removed if you‚Äôre back in the states and can contact them, or just you know...dispute it on your report. "
You can get 2 lines with unlimited everything for $120 fees and taxes included with tmobile. You also get free Netflix so why is that just marginally cheaper?
"My wife and I pay $35 each a month on T-Mobile, so it is approximately less than 1/7th of the price he is currently paying. The service is definitely mediocre, but it is far from being just marginally cheaper. 

The family plans are $35 a line after the $5 autopay discount, and there is also a senior plan for 2 lines for $35 each after the $5 autopay discount. Nowadays, Netflix is included for free so that's a $10 a month saving, and there's free international texting and calling for people who travel (albeit it's pretty mediocre as well) "
Going to only get better as they bought almost the entire last auction for band 60 out for most of the country.  I pay 70 or so per month including an international line and 2 others all unlimited can't go wrong.  Do keep my cricket sim for backup at 20$ its worth it for those times its needed.
"Wait, you do? I thought it was just cellular data didn‚Äôt count while using it for Netflix."
Don‚Äôt they have a cap? I remember reading the fine print and something along the lines of them dropping the speed after a certain amount of usage
Cricket doesn't its owned by ATT using ATT Towers... unlimited MAX for 60 or Unlimited (SD Streams) 55
Definitely not true. I have cricket (I pay for the unlimited international plan) and have had this service for over a year. Since they use ATT towers i have never had a single call dropped or had issues with my service. I even use my service internationally and It works perfect. 
"Our ""affairs"" were in order. T-Mobile customer service actually had no idea how the process worked themselves...and when we called for information (b/c there was no store in our area) they gave us the steps we needed to take. Which we attempted to take...and did not get our account resolved in the way we expected. Because customer service had no idea how to actually make sure we did not get charged the cancellation fee.

Thanks for hating victim blaming, but doing it anyway. Cheers. "
"So a $25-30 difference depending on your tax rate. It‚Äôs up to you to determine what is marginal I suppose. To me, $13 a month for service on a device I use daily that is also an order of a magnitude more available would be worth it. 

And They include a limited free version of DirectvNow that includes 30 live channels. It‚Äôs up to the end user to decide if Netflix or WatchTV is worth more to them. 

It‚Äôs all about how YOU value something based on your income and beliefs. I value it differently so marginal to me isn‚Äôt marginal to you. In the grand scheme of life, to the VAST majority of Americans, $30 a month is negligible. "
"T-Mobile One would be $120 for two lines currently. AT&T Unlimited And More would run $145 for two lines. More expensive sure but negligible if you need the vastly better service. 

Here‚Äôs the problem with these kinds of posts. Every single person has a different situation. You‚Äôve got a hell of a deal with T-Mobile. OP has a shit deal with AT&T. Unless we know SPECIFICALLY why his deal is so raw we‚Äôre all just shilling our carriers and whatever unique thing we‚Äôve got. 

People need to learn to analyze the current OPs problem. And apply it to CURRENT rates to help determine the best application. But no one gives a shit. They‚Äôd rather just spout nonsense about whatever carrier they prefer. I‚Äôd be happy to specifically analyze OPs bill to figure out why it‚Äôs high and make a recommendation. But I doubt he‚Äôs going to send me a copy. "
"Yes, call them and they will send you a link. The basic plan is for free but you can pick any other plan too. You just pay the difference."
50gb is when they start to slow it down per line. If you don't go over 2gb during a month you can get $10 back per line with their kickback program. Kickback program is free too.
I see what you are trying to say. I was originally comparing his $250 AT&T bill to a potential $120 tmobile bill. That was why I was wondering why you thought it was just marginally cheaper.
I forgot that he mentioned that his brother is military. With that information he can be saving a lot more. Since his brother is military and he can get two lines with unlimited everything with taxes and fee included for $80. We are analyzing his situation with the information that is provided. Also I doubt with AT&T that is just $145 a month. With taxes and fee it will probably be at least $170 with At&T. But like you mentioned he probably has other stuff on his plan that he is not  mentioning.
"Oh wow that‚Äôs awesome, basic is all we get anyway lol. Thanks!"
Oh really? I had no idea they gave money back as well. I remember they had a plan where if you turned in any smartphone they gave you a $12/month credit for 2 years and I gave an old and broken blackberry. I had to call every month for my credit and sometimes they gave me issues but I always got my discount. Then a year later they ended the program and bought me off and they gave me like $350 to stop the old plan. Haha I got service for a couple month for free. 
"For sure. The tmobile military discount is one of those big things now that can make it worth it by a large margin if his brothers willing to be the account holder. 

Taxes and fees are huge and variable. Live in Oregon? Add about $2 a line. Florida? Add $10-12. "
"The kickback credit is automatic. No calling needed to get your credit, you just need to enroll. They even text you when you're about to go over 2gb as a friendly reminder."
"Well damn, I‚Äôll have to ask about that! Thanks so much!"
"I just got a panda machine delivered..45 on ebay

now I am getting a spin dryer,it has no heat , but the spinning get most of  the water out"
"I had one but I wouldn't recommend it as it broke after a year and is no longer made :) 

Generally they are all pretty good, honestly. One with a spin out cycle is good because the clothes take less time to dry. You'll also want one that drains the grey water itself. 

I also recommend putting it inside a large plastic box for the possibility of a leak, and getting something like a rubber mat for underneath it so that it doesn't damage the floor or make noise. "
"These things generally cost under 100 dollars and require very little water.

I can't recommend a specific brand because I don't have one yet (I'm waiting to move into my new, much smaller home), but I'm definitely getting one."
Put it in your shower..problem solved!
"If you are looking to buy a new one, Haier has several models within your price range. I bought one for my first place and it lasted several years.  I calculated that my break-even point at around 6 months.  

While I don't generally recommend buying insurance, if you buy new, I'd probably get it since the policies are pretty cheap. Or at least put it on a credit card that has decent insurance. "
"I got a Kenmore off of Craigslist. I think she charged me maybe $50 and I paid another $40 for the man with a van. And she threw in a drying rack.

That thing was old when I got it. That was 9 years ago and it's still going.

At a certain point I had a handyman come by and he told me they don't make them like that any more, and I should hang on to it as long as I can.

But basically I'd say, Craigslist is your friend."
My landlady said we can't have one. :(
"I got the Haier 1.0 cu ft machine for roughly $250 (Canada) - I believe they're a bit cheaper in the US.

Can handle a decent load size (sheets/towels but not duvets). I was spending $3 a load at the laundromat so it paid for itself after a few months. Ended up selling it recently for $200."
"I recently bought the RCA 2.1 cu ft portable washer. It's larger than a lot that I saw, and while I've only had it a couple weeks, I really like it so far. I paid abiut $250 with walmart ship to store (but looks like it's out of stock right now).

I personally wasn't interested in the 2 tub models, switching loads didn't appeal to me. My model does a really good job of spinning. It has a quick connect hose that hooks up to my bathroom sink. It fits there permanently, if I had to move it around for each use I think I'd get a smaller one.

We live in a very hot and dry area and most things dry on the line in less than an hour! Bonus of not using the laundromat industrial dryer is that clothes should kast longer. "
My wife and I have been using a Haier for over a year with no issues. It is a pulse system not a agitator type. Works great. $300 on Amazon. She loves it. 
"I've got a cheap Giantex $109 washer with a separate spinning dryer compartment.  Been using it for almost a year.  No complaints about the machine.  I want one with auto-drain and auto-spin though.  When you want to wash a weeks' worth of close, it'll take 3-4 loads and getting up to switch them out over and over can be annoying.  "
thank you! Do you happen to know if I'd need to buy a dual-tub one to get the spin cycle?
Thanks! Someone recommended Haier to me also. They seem to be the dominant company for this sort of thing.
Seconded Haier makes a good one.
[removed]
"My old one wasn't. Just read up on the specs to see if it spins the water out at the end or not. It's not perfect but it significantly cuts back on drying time, clothes are just damp instead of sopping wet."
"They end up leaking large amounts of water fairly commonly, whether it's the machine itself or the drain hose being knocked loose from the edge of the sink. Some models can also damage the floor over time running the cycles.

It's good to check with your landlord if you do have one. "
I have seen used blu ray players going for $10 in Goodwill. 
I found one at the curb on trash day. $0
"Facebook marketplace. We just sold 2 at a garage sale for $5 a piece, should have been there!"
eBay will have someone offloading a bulk of them usually for around 20-30 (what I did) and you can get a cheap compatible remote for around 10 there as well.  The Blu-ray player also had all of the apps anybody would need.
why not stream everything instead? get a firetv for $40.
"Chaepest doesn't mean good insurance. I used to get the cheapest insurance until I got in an accident and they didn't help me one bit through the enitre process. It was the other drier's fault. Now I have other insurance, got in another accident - other drier's fault. They had good insurance and they both did very well by me. "
I got renters insurance for $5 through lemonade.com
"a wreck, a bridge, death, etc. "
Bundle if you can. I have auto and home insurance through the same company and got a discount on both policies.
"Bundling car and homeowners/renters insurance can save quite a bit of money while being able to keep your same level of coverage.  They tend to offer discounts.  We get some strange discounts, like the fact our apartment has smoke detectors and one of our cars has power locks and an alarm.  We are both college grads but because we were good students in college we get some sort of discount or lower rate as well.  So make sure you're getting every discount you can.

We have State Farm."
Self insure
"Have you had to make a claim?  I am looking for renters insurance and the reviews for lemonade made me wary. The price seems great since it averages about $200/year in my state, but from the reviews I read it seemed a nightmare to file a claim or talk to a representative.

Just wondering what your experience had been."
"As someone who investigates traffic collisions for a living, I can‚Äôt advise against this strongly enough. I assure you, you don‚Äôt have the money on hand to insure yourself against liabilities related to traffic collisions. "
"Yeah, I haven't had to thankfully. I just got it because it was the cheapest and lease I'm in required it."
"Why not? Illegal immigrants do it.  I got hit 2 years ago, no insurance, no license, no problem in Travis County! The guy got fined $80 and when he cried, the judge waived it and told me to take a walk.

Oh yea, he blew a .11 on the drunk meter"
"I was referring to civil liability, not criminal. The person who hit you likely had no assets to speak of. I‚Äôm talking about a collision with serious injury or death and you having the money on hand to self-insure yourself. You‚Äôll get cleaned out. "
"My rule with old cars is I expect to get 1 month out of every 100$ put into it.
Keep running it until it dies or isn‚Äôt able starts costing more than an average 100$ per month, at which point stop fixing it and let it die. "
If your repairs are costing you more than it would to get a better car
"Rust? Dump it.

Every dealer is blowing out sedans in my area. Everyone wants crossovers so sedans aren't selling. My buddy just scored a brand new Cruze for $12,000 out the door. "
"Seriously rusted + looking at having kids + $3k in repairs on an 18 year old car = it‚Äôs time for a different car. Yes, it's a Subaru and in theory it could run forever. I get it, I promise. I had to do this analysis on a ‚Äò97 Legacy GT wagon three weeks ago, and I'm still grieving, because I'd driven that car forever!

But it came to a point for me where I realized that the Subarus that run forever are the ones who live in the garages of mechanics every night. My GT went to someone who works for a dealership and gets parts at a discount, plus loves to tinker. If you cannot fix all the small age related issues regularly as they crop up (even if you're putting them off just due to it being inconvenient), for me that's strike one.

You want kids? The leap in safety scores from around 2012 is MASSIVE due to stricter crash testing. That's before you add on any fancy electronic safety gear. And frankly, your life is valuable too. I had no fewer than 30 friends and family who pushed on this factor with me, saying they'd been worried for years and didn't tell me because they knew I was committed to keeping the old car going. Poorer safety is strike 2.

Rust takes out most cars that otherwise might have been mechanically sound through a longer period. Strike 3.

The really bad news: Subarus hold their value to an absurd degree, especially in areas where they are popular. Buying used, you'll pay extra for being brand loyal. There's also some evidence that Subarus are more expensive to ensure and maintain. Consider Toyota or Honda if you can. (Disclaimer: I, um, ... bought another Subaru, #3 for me. Because, reasons. Since this is posted in r/frugal though, I'll acknowledge there are probably more frugal options.)

I know car payments suck. (So does paying cash, large checks are painful!) But in this case, especially due to the rust, I think that $2-3k will be better put towards a down payment than repairs.



"
"I‚Äôd drive it into the ground.  Maybe start saving for a new one, because your getting nothing for trade in.  You‚Äôd be lucky if they took it at all.  Just think of all the extra you‚Äôd be paying for a new car & insurance.  "
Just keep the car.  No need to replace it with a newer car that will be destroyed on public streets. I daily a 99 Toyota in similar cosmetic conditions.  Every day I drive that I save money compared to replacing it 
"Repair money vs the cost of a new car. Remember not to include routine maintenance, just repairs. When you‚Äôre paying more in repairs than a car payment, throw in the towel."
"We had a similar Forester and we found that although the engine and drive-train were great eventually there were other issues that caused problems. Watch out for the rusted undercarriage, that was what killed ours. The bottom just kind of fell out."
"When it starts developing powertrain issues, I'm out. Growing up, I watched my parents deal with so many problems with terribly mated new/rebuilt engines and transmissions.  I won't touch that with a ten-foot pole.

Other than that, when it starts costing me more in repairs, on average, than a car payment would, I'll look to replace it.

I don't really care about the stated value of the vehicle. I care about its value to me in terms of continued driveability - how long it can function as reliable transport and save me further vehicle costs."
"my 1992 honda civic VX is going strong. i have replaced everything. 40mpg, great commuter car. just put money aside for a new car, in 2 years you can just buy a used one without a loan."
"I‚Äôm driving a 2008 with hail damage and planning to driving it til it ‚Äúwon‚Äôt go no mo‚Äù. Until repairs exceed car pmts it‚Äôs still a win. Tires, brakes and batteries I don‚Äôt consider to be repairs as they are maintenance on cars of any age. "
"We budget $100/mo in YNAB for our 2000ish SUV. We generally cash in about every 8 months having an issue that cost anywhere from $600-$800. We tend to youtube fixes & learn about them and do repairs our self if we can saves on labor cost. 

I'd personally stray away from new car auto loans.. SO made that mistake for the first and last time. We have since realize used cars are the way to go.. and that being said in your situation - the best used car to own is the one you already have. 

Since ownership of our SUV we've spent $5,443.70 - that includes the purchase price of $2,800 as well as regular maintenance.

$5,443 / 35 months of owner ship = $156 on average per month. I could never find a newer car payment for that cheap... not to mention insurance coverage is very affordable.    

With out purchase price included this SUV has cost us on average  $76/month since ownership... Again I don't think we could beat that. Once this average exceeds $100 moth or maybe even $150 - we will look into buying another used car. For now - we just budget for repairs and have a savings for buying our next car cash. I estimate at least another 35 months out of this car - minimum.    So by then we will have saved $5k cash to buy another used car. "
"How soon are you planning on a baby? If it's two years away, I would fix the Subaru and drive it until you are ready to give birth, and buy another subaru. If you want to get pregnant in a year, try to hold off until the fall, and look for cars when subaru is trying to get rid of 18s. 

We have a 2017 Legacy and we absolutely love it. It's very safe, we did get the top of the line saftey features (ie eyesight). When we replace our 09 accord in 5 years or so, we hope to get an outback. We paid $24,500 after I did some serious haggling. We also got 0% financing. We are in no rush to pay it off. 

"
"i think it depends on the miles you will put on it from now on. If you dont intend on doing too many and the alternative is borrowing to get a newer one, I would spend on maintainting the existing one. 2-3 sounds like a lot but its 2 or 3 problems covered in one go. Car is in good shape so worth spending on."
Is that not including gas? Sounds really low to me.
">The undercarriage is also seriously rusted

Hijacking top post, sorry. Dump the car. Serious rust is a 100% car-killer. It cannot be repaired in any practical sense and often poses a significant safety hazard as rust can weaken important structural and steering/suspension components. The car becomes weaker in a crash. A badly - rusty component can suddenly fail, resulting in a crash that can hurt/kill you and/or others. 

If the car were rust - free, I'd say keep it and drive it because you can live with or fix all the other issues. But serious rust changes everything. Don't put another dime in it. Sell it (someone can use for parts etc) and get something else. "
"It should cost you like half of a new car, ditch it before it gets to this point. "

"Hell, I'll handle powertrain issues.

Rust is car cancer tho."
Without gas. 
"I agree 100%, rust is a deal killer, especially when it‚Äôs in need of so much in additional repairs. 
I love not having a car payment, but you have to draw the line somewhere. Our last car 
was a 2004 Murano. It needed repairs and was going to need a new set of tires in the
near future as well. When I looked at what it was worth, we decided to get a new car."
"yeah, I guess it depends on what the OP means by severely rusted. Within 5-7 years the undercarriage of every vehicle around here *looks* rusty as hell, but they are still solid for quite a few years before you have to start worrying about actual perforations. Of course OP's vehicle is a 2000 so it's going to look pretty rusty, but hard telling if it's surface rust or an actual problem waiting to happen. "
Let me clarify: if your repairs cost more than what it would to get a decent used car then get rid of it
Or the total cost of a different car. It didn‚Äôt sound like the OP had that saved up but I might be wrong. 
"New water heater.  Was easier than I thought it would be but had to move the workbench and shelf, so time was involved.  Soldering was the fun part.  I love winning small battles like this, and learning something new.

Also, water heaters are heavy.

Did I do an ok job?"
Why didn‚Äôt you go tankless? Those units are a lot lighter and easier to install.
"I used to have that same thing exact model. If you start having issues with the pilot light going off randomly 1-2 a month, call the warranty information and get the interface replaced. I missed my warranty period by 2 months"
"Just recently got a new water heater and had it installed for cheap by a family friend! (Like 50$) Let me tell you, getting it downstairs was hard as FUCK for one person."
You should build an insulated container to retain heat. It will reduce the amount of electricity needed to heat the water and save you $$$
They make a sharkbite flex line for connecting water lines to the tank. I highly recommend for anyone attempting this without much prior experience sweating copper pipes.
I've done it as well.  Wasn't too hard other than getting the heavy thing into the closet.  Did you check the gas line for leaks with some fluid?  That's the main thing I would be concerned with doing it yourself as you may not notice a small gas leak.
How much did you paid for your BW water heater? and What model was it? A plumbe charges me $1100 for the BW heater that included installation.
"It is worth noting that in some places the gas connection has to be done, or at least checked, by the gas company, and you may need a permit.  For your safety it is worth it, in any case."
"Pulling the old one out and putting a new one in the exact same spot is always easier.  A tankless would have required electrical, rerouting water and gas lines, the exhaust.  "
"Eh, I don‚Äôt have a good answer.  Too much change at once?  Fear of the unknown.

Are they that much better?  Or is installation just easier?"
"Tankless only makes sense for those who have a gas HW heater like OP. Tankless electric requires huge amounts of electricity and there are no savings. If you have an electric HW heater, you should look at the hybrid models. They use a heat pump and are perfect if your HW heater is in a basement or in a room that always gets hot."
"You got a deal.  It took me most of an afternoon working at a leisurely pace.

But I feel manly when I look at it every day."
Don't do this. Talk to any reputable plumber. Shark bites leak over time. They are great for temporary fixes but not a safe long term solution.
"I actually reused the flexible copper lines for the input and output, but had to re-route the pressure relief valve copper line."
It was about $550 or $600.
"To answer your question, unless you often find yourself running out of hot water, no. Far more expensive upfront costs, far more expensive annual maintenance, installation is exactly the same aside from weight. Unless you use a lot of hot water, then they don't make sense."
"If done right, I think they're guaranteed for 10 or 20 years, but I agree. I also have a lot of experience sweating copper, so it's what I'd pick."
Any reputable plumber is going to tell you that because they can charge out the ass to sweat copper or expand pex. Shark bites are code compliant and acceptable for ‚Äúpermanent‚Äù connection including subterranean. 
Thank you.  We have never run out of hot water.

Schedule it up to pay couple dollars to your credit card every day?
amazon gift card 50 cent reloads
"25 is pretty high. I have a similar account, by it only requires 12 per month. I usually use mine too buy a drink or some gum from the vending machines at work."
"25 debit transactions a month? That's crazy high. You're going to waste more money buying things you don't need and/or gas trying to deliberately spread out your spending than you do in interest. Not to mention if you do all your spending on your debit card, you're not spending it on a credit card, and not earning rewards/cash back.

The rate would have to be crazy high to make this worth it. And even then, not sure it would be worth the hassle."

Buy a few groceries daily? Like fresh vegetables and fruit.
"If there are various groceries in your area, they each run their own sales. Check out what store has the lowest cost for particular items on your list and go to the correlating stores. Even if you only go to two stores once a week each, thats about 7 or 8 transactions right there. Not including the oh shit moments for when you have to go grab something random you don't have in the pantry. 

If you have a car, under-filling your tank will have you getting petrol more often throughout the month. If can you pay at the pump, go inside and grab a cheap water or something less than $1. That's 2 transaction right there. 

If you shop at department stores, from my experience, they have various check-out locations. If you pay in each section as you shop you can rack up a few transactions right there. "
"Set up automatic payments for utilities and other monthly bills. Get gas. Get groceries. Go to the movies. Stop and get a coffee once in a while. Cat food. Dog food. Walmart for toilet paper and laundry detergent. A shirt. Prescriptions. Vet.

well I'd just take out 20 bucks and put it back in 
"If you're under transactions near the end of the month why not just buy gas a few bucks at a time? Put in the card, fill up a few bucks, end transaction, repeat. It'll take a bit of extra time but seems like an easy way to top off your transactions for free."
"My credit union offers something similar, I think we get 2.25% or something, but the requirement is only 15 transactions. The catch for us is that at the end of the month, the average transaction has to be >$10. So a bunch of $1 transactions for us might bring us below that per transaction level."

"What kind of interest rates are we talking about here? If you don't exactly need the money liquid, I would suggest a brokerage account and don't bother with that nonsense  "
A recurring steady bill like Netflix or Xbox Live?

With Prime Day coming up this may just work. Thank you!

"It's 3.01 APY up to $25,000, so it's higher than my savings or ""money management"" savings, but ultimately nowhere near ""Passive Income"" levels of interest. I will speak with my credit union, thank you!"

"I will keep those ideas in mind, thank you!"
"I don't know if I'm making that many purchases like that in a given month, but I guess this is the trick to try and get me to spend more. I'll pay attention to what I'm buying and make sure to use the debit card. Thank you! "
"This would be an easy way, seems like a possible plan. I'll keep it in mind, thanks!"
"This will be more stress and trouble than its worth. I wouldn't even try it. Think about it. You have to buy something with that card every single day. You'll be thinking about it every day, did I make that purchase today, I'll skip it and do two transactions tomorrow, etc. Then you have to do that every month, keep count of all transactions. I would not do it. "
"If you do use it 4x/week than it's about $10/class.  $10 is not a lot for a class and you seem to have other reasons you want to join as well.  I would go for it.

I do not have an expensive gym membership, but sometimes I pay quite a lot for hot yoga classes, and don‚Äôt regret it as long as I use the facilities & services I‚Äôm paying for. "
I have a gym membership that I never use--it's free as a benefit of my employment.
I pay $99 a month for a boxing gym membership for my wife and I (got it during a 2 for 1 deal). I can say it is absolutely worth the money for us. We both enjoy the classes much more than any self motivation style gyms and the results have been incredible. We both go 7+ times a week if we can manage it. I‚Äôm down about 25 pounds in 6 months (proper diet required) and am in the best shape of my life. It‚Äôs really good stress relief just punching things too.
"I think it's important to consider that you're not really paying for the *gym,* you're paying for the accountability and discipline that you think this joining this gym will help you with. And that's a real and legitimate thing that can be worth paying for it if it works. I would say if you can afford it, and you're not locked into a long-term commitment with it, why not do it and see how it goes?

I have a work gym that costs $0 and a home gym too, but my wife still is a paying member of **two** different gyms. One because it has a social aspect and the other because it has 24-hour access and A/C (our home gym is outside). For me that would be frivolous, but for her it isn't because the social and availability aspects make it more likely that she'll work out regularly (which she does). So for her it's worth it, there's no need to justify it. Health and fitness are important to us and we have the money to do it.  :)"
Do it. Frugality is about saving money on things that don't matter as much so you can splurge on things that do matter.
"I dog walk/pet sit on the side to pay for dance classes. My general rule?

"It‚Äôs definitely not exactly what you‚Äôre looking for, but you could try out a UFC gym if there‚Äôs one near you, they usually have pretty exorbitant sign up fees but they usually have a promotion going on that waives them, and the pricing per month is pretty comparable to other gyms in my area"

"Meh, I guess you could do that, but dish soap is cheap enough. A giant jug from Costco is like $6 and that lasts me most of a year (and I don't have a dishwasher)."
This is a genius idea!
Do you add any water?
"I do this with a lot of household products, to be honest.    My favourite is a spray bottle filled with water, and then add a touch of fabric softener.    I give my couch, bed, clothes, etc a little spritz and it turns into a poor man's Febreeze."

The funny thing is, they now sell foam dish soap, for $4 (I don't even look at the price haha). I do the same with hand soap.  It's environmental and frugal :)  (Edit: added more words) "
"Fun fact, this method is also a generally effective non toxic garden insecticide. "
"Buy the big bottle of dish soap, but put it in a smaller bottle and refill it from the big bottle. You will use less naturally, especially as it gets close to empty. 

A tip for laundry detergent. I used to take the bottle and pour directly in the holder of the machine, right up to the fill line. I used the cap that comes with the detergent one day and figured out I was using almost double the amount needed. "
I just used this to clean my entire apartment.  Anything that was a bit hard to get off the surface would be sprayed and sit for like 5 minutes and come off with no problems.

That is such a good idea. Thanks for sharing. I will definitely be doing this.

Making foaming dish soap work well too.
"All the spray bottles I‚Äôve purchased or reused (like windex and things like that) break after a month or two of infrequent use. Even the dollar store vs Target bottles didn‚Äôt change much their longevity much. Do you have any suggestions? 

"
Or get cleaning chemicals from the dollar tree (or other store). Same stuff
I use a quarter dish soap and the rest diluted with water
"Shit advice.  Saving diluted soap water isn't even sanitary.  I don't know your method of dish washing. but you should be filling your sink with water and soap and washing everything from there.  If its just a few times, just juse a drop of soap!"
I bought a giant pump bottle of blue Dawn and a foaming dispenser. It lasted for five years. 
Just washing liquid or do you dilute it with some water? I would think the viscosity of the liquid alone will block the pores in the spray bottle. 
i use a concentrated dish soap for one of those foam pump dispensers and I'll fill it halfway with soap and half with water and it works just as well! 
"I do this when camping at burns. I have a Soap (wash), water (rinse), and bleach/water (sanitize) bottles that are color coded with big labels. "
This is a great idea! I do have a habit of accidentally wasting/using more soap than I need.
Do you mean dish soap? How do you get that to spray?
"Save money on dish soap by buying paper plates! Lmao jk, good tip."
"I just spray some vinegar on the dishes. Cuts through the fats, drastically reduces dish soap use.

As others have pointed out, though, there are much more worthwhile places to search for money to save. "
"I will never ever ever understand why people can't just fill up the sink with soapy water and wash the dishes that way.  Doing it that way conserves so much more soap than this half-baked and unsanitary idea (lol OP believing the ""science is backed by peeps wanting to profit""); plopping soap right on the dirty dish or the sponge just wastes soap.  Don't have two sinks?  Run the water to rinse slowly and do dishes more frequently.  Have dry hands?  Follow up with moisturizer, you should probably use it anyways unless you've got baby's skin.  Literally no excuse to engage in soap-wasting behaviour, especially if it makes you turn to awful ideas like this."
Just don't do this with peppermint soaps like Dr. Bronner's! It will make you or someone else cough since it aerosolizes. Found out the hard way.
Good idea. Should try this. 
"Ooh good idea. I already use water, vinegar and dish soap in a hollow handle scrub brush in the shower. A spray bottle would be perfect in both spots. "
"Wow. Great idea, thank you! Now I just need to actually remember it come washing time. lol"
"Here's a LPT to save on dish soap: wash your dishes right after you are done and you probably won't even need it. I do it every time, even while cooking, and it saves so much time and money. "
Wanna save more? Add some water to the spray bottle to dilute the soap a little bit
"Are you saying washing liquid is the dish detergent?

"
I regularly flip my cups inside out and reuse them. Even the glass ones.
thats the real frugal way
[removed]
Gets harder to do with forks and spoons. But ill find a way 
You woke me up 
"Same here. It's one of those easily visible things you could save a few dollars on a year... I find that I was brought up poor and focus too much on these little things, when I could spend my energy on bigger savings like finding out better insurance rates."
"Same here - whenever I see tips on how to save dish soap, I always picture someone unscrewing the lid on a bottle of it and then just glorping a bunch into a sponge. "
"Same with all the laundry detergent tips.  I can see if you have a big family, but it seems like most people on here are single adults.  I do like four loads of laundry a month so it's not a major expense to me. Just wear your clothes more than once before washing and you'll save a bunch easily."
[removed]
My roommates go through a ton. They waaaay over use
You obviously have a different wash method than my SO. Last week I saw that we were almost a quarter down on a new large bottle of dish soap after only 3 days!
"Or the opposite ends is my girlfriend who goes through a bottle every week and a half.  These aren't even the small sized bottles. Yeah, she has problems, and I suffer for it."
"Some people take frugal too far. OP mixes in water, making the chemical reactions of soap different than the company intended, and often changes the sanitary level."
Plus Dollar Tree sells 50 oz bottles that are not a bit watered down. I don't remember when I bought the present bottle.
We probably spend closer to $4 a month.  Big family that cooks a lot.  So sometimes the savings on things like soap add up.  
"I feel like I buy dish soap like once a year. Usually from Costco and it's like a giant two pack for $8.


For me personally I focus on the bigger stuff. I know the little stuff adds up but do I really want to spend time and effort cutting my dish soap budget from $8 to $6 ? Is it worth while?

"
"Nah, I‚Äôve had a gallon bottle of Costco dish soap for over a year and a half. It‚Äôs only just getting to the bottom now. "
About once a year I buy a bottle of Dawn professional dish soap at Sam's Club. It's $12 but usually I catch it on sale before we run out.  The effort of trying to save more money on it wouldn't be worth it at that point.
We bought a gigantic bottle of Dawn Dishwasher Soap from Costco about.... 3 years ago? And the current Saran Wrap pack we‚Äôre using is from about the same time. 
"Feeding a family solves this ""problem"""
I buy one of the big bottles of dawn from costco and 2 years later still havent gone through it.
"I have a dishwasher so one of the bigger bottles of dawn lasted me over a year. I'm on my second bottle now. It's going faster since j hand wash baby bottles everyday. But I opened in Feb and it's 50% empty.

Even found on Amazon two bigger Dawn dish soap for 4 dollars when I usually get one for 3. so now I have quite the supply now!"
"I cook a lot (like 5 times a week) and go through one of those big $8 Costco dish soaps a little faster than once a year. Which makes my annual dish soap expenditure maybe $10-12. 

Of all the ways I can save money, dish soap is at the very bottom of my list. "
I just buy a bigass bottle of Dawn at Costco for like $9 and it lasts and lasts. I have a small bottle I keep by my sink and just keep refilling it.
Consumer Reports said that all dish soaps more or less get the job done and suggest you go with whatever is cheapest in your area. That sounds like a far better tip than this.
I find a lot of the things I eat if I just rinse it after with hot water it's fine.   
I agree. I go to the Dollar Store and I'm set but I do use an automatic dishwasher for most things and the dish soap is just used for quick cleanups or items that can't go in the dishwasher.
Same with hand soap. Just buy a big-ass refill pack/jug instead of buying new bottles.
"Yeah I don't have a dishwasher either, and spend about the same buying the big Ajax bottles when they're on sale for $1. One bottle lasts about 2 months with daily use for a family of 3, and I'm a clean freak. "
Just wait n' see the dish soap companies will bring out dish spray soon lol
Dish soap companies hate him(tm)!
Yes sorry add a little dish soap then top up with water.
that doesn't build up a layer of grime on your furniture over time?
1 part bleach with ~~200~~ 256 (200ppm) parts water makes a good safe disinfectant spray for showers and counter tops that costs 1/100th of what pre-mixed disinfectant sprays sell for.
I do the same thing and spray my clothes before sticking them into the dryer with a dryer sheet for a couple of minutes on low to get wrinkles out and take lint and pet hair off my clothes. 
good Idea that will be my next one to try.
That trick also works as an anti-static spray for your clothes. 
"All it says is that highly diluted soap in a separate bottle can lead to microbial growth over time. A smallish bottle that gets used up within a week should be ok, or OP could use distilled water to eliminate microbes.  
  
I would say that if you live alone, OP's method is probably a good idea. If you have a family/make a lot of dishes, it's probably best to just fill up the sink and add soap to the water.  
  
If anyone out there is reading this and saying ""but I use the dishwasher"" (which I know is considered a major crime in the world of /r/frugal but whatever) you can save money by making your own detergent with citric acid, washing soda, and kosher salt. Works great, way cheaper."
"I usually squirt a bit into a bowl and fill the bowl with water each time I do dishes.  Then dip the sponge into the bowl as needed.  

I don't know anything about contamination or dillution ratios, but I can dilute the dish detergent pretty far and I have a fresh made batch every time.  One less bottle or thingy I have to keep in my tiny kitchen.  "
why not? If you are going to go by the advice of the people who make it then the science behind it is flawed from the start because it's in their best interest to sell more. what evidence is there that proves the claims of this company who tested this? I personally think this is just a scare tactic myself.

"I know some people really think thats gross, but I let my dog do that. Then they soak, then dishwasher. The dishwasher gets so hot you can't touch a plate on the dry cycle. Pretty sure it kills dog germs. 

Also there are guests Ive had over and I would wayyyy rather have my dog's germs on my plate than their germs on my fork (if there are germs left)"
Clean as cold water can get them.
"Yeah, this tip feels like OP is missing the forest for the trees."
This sub is called frugal. No one should be shamed for sharing their ideas. I‚Äôd rather see more posts like this than seeing someone‚Äôs random Goodwill find that doesn‚Äôt benefit me at all. A couple dollars a year adds up if you are saving small bits of money in random ways. Especially for people who are trying to get by with little money. 
Yeah. Waste of effort.
"No don‚Äôt studies have shown that children who live in homes with sanitized dish washers have worse out comes than normally hand washed dishes.

"
The physical action of the water running over the dishes removes bacteria. No need for harsh chemicals. 
"Or water it down and spray it so it lasts for 2 years like a normal, frugal person."
"Brilliant way to wash the kids!

But then maybe I misunderstood."
"Only run when full. Kirkland pods and Jet Dry. Normal cycle (not quick or heavy, which use more energy). Stop dishwasher once it starts the dry cycle and leave the door open to air dry."
I was buying Palmolive gel or Walmart brand powder but Consumer Reports said Kirkland pods were the best and they were cheap enough so when shopping at Costco with my MIL (who is a member) we picked up a box of them. 
"I don't know I wash my own dishes by hand, the only reason I can Imagine using a dishwasher would be in a business and for health and safety so I'd refer to the rules on that one."
"While I normally agree with you, the current dish soap sold at Dollar Tree tends to be pretty shit. It's better to spend a few pennies more and get something decent like Ajax. "

Just don‚Äôt eat. Save money on food and lose weight. Ultimate frugal tip.

"Nah. Both ends of the fork and spoon, then flip it over. Bam, 4 uses"

"I don't have a large family but we have a decent amount of laundry regardless. Between sports, a job that involves animals, swimming, etc I've got a minimum of 4 loads a week. "
"Definitely depends on what you do for a living. We have a farm and while sometimes our clothes can be reworn, when they can't, they REALLY can't.

As my husband says to people, 'only ask a farmer what that stain is on his clothes if you're REALLY sure you want to know'."
"I do laundry most days a week due to a messy toddler. I could probably get by by doing it less often, but I don't want the stains to set in from her spilling food and drink all over herself.

We go through a lot of laundry soap. It's one of the few things I don't go super cheap on, but I still won't shell out the dough for Tide. "
There are 3 of us in my family and I buy detergent twice a year at Sam's (no Costco in this area). My son has some incontinence issues and I feel like I do an above average amount of laundry.
$13? Not even. Dish soap is cheap as fuck
"Reminds of a meme that said something like ""Saw my roommate grab six paper towels to clean up a spill, I thought damn, when did we win the lottery"""
"Genuine question:

[removed]
You wash dishes with water anyways
It doesn't need to be that high of soap content. Drug dealers cut their product w/ different things to make it last longer and it still does the trick. Same concept here.
Plus why? I understand OP is doing a whole spray thing and it‚Äôs different. But just adding water to make soap last longer is... a waste of time. Just squirt less soap out. You‚Äôre using water that‚Äôs gonna mix with the soap while you‚Äôre cleaning. 
Yeah for things like crackers 
"I‚Äôve found the cheap bottle from Save A Lot works just as well as name brand so that‚Äôs what I go with now. I don‚Äôt really like the way water changes dish soap, it becomes too watery and doesn‚Äôt seem to work as well."
Actually I have already bought this from Aldi.

They have it however it's not that great and goes quick. 
"Water and dish soap in a spray bottle is also my go-to wasp killer. Weighs them down so they can't fly and suffocates them, dead in seconds."
"Keep in mind that the preservatives in soap break down a lot faster in water. You should only dilute at the time of use.

An old thread on this: https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/13by00/if_priced_in_line_with_foaming_hand_soap_a_bar_of/c72tj46/?context=1"
I only do this when the soap gets so low it doesn't reach the tube anymore. I'm all for making stuff last so I'm  going to try this. I always save my spray bottles too. 
Not supposed to dilute dish soap like that.  
"Well I only use it on washables and fabrics, really.   Like the covers come off the cushions, the mattress has a cover, etc.   It would leave a gross, slimy film over time on anything solid, I'd imagine.   But the rest of the house smells like clean laundry!"
"Well, you aren't soaking the fabric multiple times a day. It's a once a week thing and you do it lightly. Plus if you vacuum your fabric furniture you are removing the dust and lint on a regular basis anyway. "
If you want something you can just spray to your hearts content I would recommend using some essential oils and water. Just make sure your spray bottle has a very fine mist and you're good to go. 
That‚Äôs a great idea! I‚Äôm constantly going at my shirts with lint rollers.
"> OP could use distilled water to eliminate microbes.

Yeah, this would probably be fine imo.

>which I know is considered a major crime in the world of /r/frugal

Why though? Don't dishwashers actually use less water than a sink?"
"I do similar, but I use a pump bottle and fill it with dishwashing soap.  I get just the right amount of soad instead of squeeze-pouring."
">I usually squirt a bit into a bowl and fill the bowl with water each time I do dishes

>In families who use hand dishwashing, allergic diseases in children are less common than in children from families who use machine dishwashing. We speculate that a less-efficient dishwashing method may induce tolerance via increased microbial exposure.

The researchers compared allergic diseases in children whose families report handwashing their dishes to those same diseases in families who machine-wash their dishes. They were not looking at the use of a sanitizer after washing, which is what OP asked.

The methods of the study and its applicability are also questionable. They just sent a questionnaire to 1029 families with 7-8 year olds in Coastal Sweden. There is very little control in the research, and there's no mention of eliminating selection bias because, again, they only surveyed 7-8 year olds living in Coastal Sweden."

"I think every dish gets a squirt of detergent, regardless of how much I tell her it's counterproductive to use that much soap."

That is pretty grim."
Why?
"Depends on the oils and pets. :) But yes, be aware of what you spray in your home. I kind of assumed that was a given. "
"Yep, some high proof alcohol will help with drying. If you're spraying over carpet/beds/cloth furniture, I wouldn't worry about it. But if you're spraying over hardwood floors or coffee tables, etc, it can be helpful to add some alcohol. 

Although honestly at that point I would almost rather recommend a cheap diffuser. I know it may seem like a frivolous purchase, but for me, not having to spray every room or mix up a new bottle of Fakebreeze is worth the little I spent on a couple of decent diffusers. 

Plus the rgb matches my pc. "

"Per person per week we wash 1 load of towels; 2-3 loads of bedding (our animals are allowed in the beds); half load of whites; 1-2 loads of lights, colors, or darks. For the family there are 2-3 denim loads. I wash my couch covers 1-2 times monthly. I wash the mattress protectors once a month (5 beds, 3 loads.) Curtains are probably every 2 months. There are 1-2 daily loads of towels. Canvas grocery bags. Backpacks. Pillows are probably 2 loads a month. Floor mats/rugs. Reusable personal items, 1 load a month. Covers for dust mop and swiffer sweeper. Truthfully I'm probably forgetting a bunch of stuff. Part of it is having lots of kids and letting them explore and make lots of messes. Lots of our laundry is because we live in a desert with a dirt yard and pets. The adults rewear as much as possible but it's gross to rewear sweaty items and it's hot enough to break out in a sweat just walking through the yard to get to the carport."
Tell that to my daughters. Also tell my dog that it's okay to pee outside when it's raining instead of on my bed. It takes 4 loads to wash my bedding and it's Monsoon season.

"Bloomberg Review: 

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-02-24/instant-pot-review-can-it-really-cook-anything

‚ÄúPlenty of kitchen gadgets have their die-hard fans, but it‚Äôs rare to see a mania grow as quickly as that surrounding the Instant Pot. Although the [] gadget has technically been around since 2010, it has enjoyed months of attention after becoming the surprise bestselling item on Amazon.com‚Äôs annual Prime Day last July. Since then, home cooks can‚Äôt seem to get enough of the device, which makes a hefty promise to slow cook, steam, saut√©, pressure cook and even make yogurt‚Äîall in a faster, safer way than other kitchen appliances.‚Äù"
"Buy a used Crock-Pot from the 70s at Goodwill or the like. The ones that look [like this](https://img1.etsystatic.com/000/0/5202331/il_570xN.321703453.jpg). These things are so simple they will last forever! 

I have good luck setting mine on low when I leave for work in the morning, and I have a hot meal when I get back 9 hours later :-)

If you need a timer, buy a cheap outlet timer like you'd use for timed lights when you're on vacation. You can then set it to start cooking however long before you get home."
"Have you ever considered or looked into thermos cooking?  It works well too, I basically make a meal and place it into a thermos, stays hot for a long time.  Not sure if thats somethign that would work for a family."
"I would check out thrift stores and try to find an old crock-pot, as in: the brand crock-pot slow cooker. The ones from the 60s and 70s seem to be made for eternity. You will find a lot of examples on /r/BuyItForLife (and might want to post there, too.) If they aren't programmable, get a timer switch. The less technique something has, the less can break. 

A crock-pot often appears to last a lot longer than a slow cooker from another brand, too. The next best brand is Hamilton Beach, AFAIK.  

You may also consider if there's a certain thing you do (other than a frequent use) that causes the slow cooker to break, like: not fill it up enough / fill it up to high / clean it incorrectly etc. I don't mean to say it's your fault that things break, I'm just thinking it might be worth investigation because I remember someone who said their inlay broke again and again and again after a certain time and it finally appeared the reason for that was that they used a steel sponge to clean it. 

If you are willing to take a chance: several people on amazon.co.uk reviewing Andrew James slow cookers said that they use them every day and they hold up well. They aren't sold on amazon.com, but you will find one (brand new) on sale on Ebay (search for: 323343846530) for $11. 
"
"I bought an outlet timer to use with my 6 quart slow cooker. I couldn't find one that did what I wanted, and I'm surprised at how many other uses I find for this silly little timer."
"Although I don‚Äôt always use its slow cooker function, I have been using an instant pot several times a week for about 3 years. I use the slow cook function fairly regularly, and have results at least equal to those I got in my crock pot. 

The instant pot has a timer that will turn it on whenever you want. I typically leave home around 6 am and have it start cooking at 11 am or thereabouts and cook for 6-7 hours. When the cook time is up, it switches to a keep warm setting. I often don‚Äôt get home until after 9 pm and dinner has been kept warm for me in the pot, while my family ate hours earlier. 

You‚Äôll see a lot of folks claiming the instant pot doesn‚Äôt work for slow cooking, but that has not been my experience. It has been if anything better than my crockpot. "
"My cheap hack is to use a Christmas light timer with my old slow cooker. I get it ready before I leave home, set the timer for the start and stop times I want and plug it in."
"I was reading that you can't add ingredients with this as you cook. Something about once you set it, it's locked until done? Have you heard anything about this?"
"After reading the article, I'm just not seeing how this works for what I need. I'm looking for something we can set and forget and this seems to be more along the lines of making cooking while you're going to be home easier. 

Maybe I read the article wrong but that's what I'm getting from it."
I've done that off and on for myself but I don't think I can do dinner for the entire family that way. Lol
With the programmable one I like the idea that when it's done it will automatically kick to warm. But I want one that can take being used fairly often without having to be replaced every 3-6 months.
if you are using a pressure cook setting you cannot open it once it starts to cook without losing pressure. 
"Agree with other replyer. IP only locks up when in pressure cooking or steam mode. 
If you want to cook stuff with different times, lets say 10 and 5 min you should do it as something like this:
5 min with long cooking food, release pressure and faster food and cook 5 more minutes. "
"The IP is great but it does require more work than a slow cooker. I have both and I use the IP for some stuff and the slow cooker for other recipes. When I want to ‚Äúset it and forget it,‚Äù I use the slow cooker. "
"Check out their website or the Facebook fan club. It functions as a slow cooker, steamer, regular pot, rice cooker, yogurt maker, deep fryer, etc. Basically you can do just about anything, except toast. "
"But I can if using the slow cooker option, correct? I know sometimes on weekends I'll throw something in and add some last minute this and that."
"The Slow cooker function on the IP is utter shite. It‚Äôs a gimmick, IMO. Better off using a slow cooker for slow cooking. "
"It‚Äôs only an issue when pressure cooking;  even then you can turn it off, let it cool down to eliminate the pressure, add your stuff then heat it up again. "
The slow cooker option on the IP is utter shite. 
"Yeah, that's why I'm looking for a quality programmable slow cooker but just keep getting told about the IP."
"I had the same problem. It‚Äôs all Instant Pot. It‚Äôs certainly useful but I don‚Äôt find it convenient. A slow cooker is way more convenient, IMO. (Also I‚Äôm super over the Instant Pot cult. It‚Äôs an appliance, not the messiah.) 

So I stopped asking around and googled slow cooker reviews. America‚Äôs Test Kitchen has great product reviews. I know they‚Äôve reviewed slow cookers but I cannot remember what make and model they recommend. "
Thanks! I'll give it a look.
"I got an IP for Christmas and there are some things I like about it (less dishes to clean because you can sautee and pressure book in the same unit) but I still use my slow cooker more often.  I haven't used the IP as a slow cooker, but I've heard mixed reviews so I use my tried and true slow cooker.  (Which is Hamilton Beach brand.  I use it a lot and have no complaints)"
They‚Äôll contact your optometrist to confirm your prescription if you order online
"I‚Äôve been using the dailies for years and just last week asked my optometrist if I could try out a monthly pair to see if they‚Äôd work as well and save me money. She gave me a pair of the monthlies to try out. It‚Äôs worth asking your optometrist to see if you can get some trial lenses before purchasing anything.
As far as saving money on contacts, I‚Äôve had great experiences with 1-800 contacts and they‚Äôll price match other websites."
Biofinity is $90/year how are you going to find cheaper for a modern contact lense?
But if they don‚Äôt get it...you can still place the order. 
"The the monthly ones working out so far? I think my discomfort comes form lack of moisture. When I take them out they are very dry. I currently do not wear them when working on the computer or playing a video game. They do well though during activities like driving, hiking, sports, and anything not related to viewing a screen."
"The monthlies are comfortable enough, but my vision isn‚Äôt as sharp in them so I‚Äôll be sticking with the dailies. It‚Äôs weird because they‚Äôre the same prescription. "
"That's a good idea, and something I have never thought of! Thanks!"
"I got mine on eBay and love it. Paid like  172.38$ from China, its called the sleeplace novus 9inch cool gel memory foam mattress, can't recommend enough! Had about 2 years and absolutely love it. Oh and very soft."
the spa sensations mattress from Walmart has actually been amazing for me. been sleeping on it for 4 years now.
Sleep Innovations mattresses are under $300 and my 200lb. athletic SO says it‚Äôs the best mattress he‚Äôs ever slept on.
We got ours at Costco and it‚Äôs been going strong for like 8 years. Not sure what they cost these days but I think it was less than $300
"Comment got deleted because I linked. but the Spa Sensations 12"" Theratouch Memory Foam Mattress on walmart is the best mattress I've ever slept on. 5000 4.5 star reviews. King size is under $300. "
"I have the 12 inch Zinus pillowtop mattress and it‚Äôs a little too soft for me. I‚Äôm heavier than you so, I sink in a little more. I wanted something that wouldn‚Äôt put a ton of pressure on my shoulders and hips, and it doesn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs very comfortable when I first lie down, and I can sleep on it just fine, better than on most mattresses, but I could do with more support. Since you‚Äôre lighter it might be enough for you. 

Word to the wise after a year and a half of cheapo mattress ownership...rotate any sub-$300 mattress regularly, everyday wear and tear gets noticeable surprisingly quickly if you always sleep in the same spot on the mattress. "
The ground is softer than a zinus mattress.
"This. Just replied with a link, it's so good I cannot believe I got a king for ~$300"
"look on fb marketplace. it can be a bit of a hell-hole, but you can find some great deals on there. just be sure to check everything when you collect it, there‚Äôs no receipts when you go through the marketplace.

i got my ps4 slim through it for ¬£160, with two controllers, god of war and gta v. my point is that it works (but be careful).

"Just as a punt, you could always make a post on freecycle to see if anyone has one going spare in your local area.  (This isn‚Äôt as ridiculous as it sounds, as we actually gave away an old Xbox on freecycle.)"
Prime Day is coming up so there might be a deal there. There's also r/hardwareswap to check out as well if you haven't yet. 
"Used game stores sometimes offer huge discounts on used, but still fairly new systems that are typically in great shape. And they‚Äôll often take old phones, DVD‚Äôs etc as trade-ins"
Thanks for the ideas everyone!  Much appreciated. 
"Do you have an older system that you can trade in? We have a store near us called Game Exchange (similar to Game Stop, but they give a little bit more on trade ins). My son was able to sell them his Wii U, controllers, games, Skylanders figures, etc. and he got $199 store credit for all of it. He then turned around and bought a refurbished Xbox One from them for $210.99. less the $199 store credit and he only paid $11.99"
"Also, check stores such as half price books, or 2nd and Charles if you have them near you. They‚Äôll run sales that apply to everything in store, up to 50% off. So if they have a used Xbox
One for $180, you‚Äôre walking away cheap. Just have to be the first there."
I‚Äôll check it out. Thanks!!

"I was using a cup and I loved it. Now I'm on the IUD and haven't had a period in 2 years, so that's cut back my costs too."

Been using a mooncup for 10/11 years and I'm only now going to have to replace mine because of having a baby. So I have spent about ¬£20 on hygiene products in a decade which isn't too shabby.

"Cup was the best thing I got tbh. I still haven't made my money back on it. BUT it's waay more convinient, has saved tons of mess and toilet drama and is the easiest thing to maintain. Will never look back to one time use products again :D "
"The cup has revolutionized how i experience my period. Its so amazing!  Oddly enough, i almost purchased my first set if cloth liners today. Think i will pick some up tomorrow!"
"I want a cup damnit! This is my sign to do it, right?? I‚Äôve already made a small investment in THINX and have been curious to try a cup. "
"I started making the switch to a cup in December. I believe mine is called ""Moon Cup"", a company in the UK. Got the referral from a friend who lived there at the time and I've been happy with it. Took a few months to adjust."
What if you don‚Äôt like using tampons to begin with? Has anyone switch from pads to cup? 
"Been thinking of making the switch, but I read somewhere that the cup accumulates bacteria and stuff and you can‚Äôt just rinse it and put it back in. And something about toxic shock syndrome. What‚Äôs your guys experiences with it?"
Where did you get these from? Have been considering a similar switch!
I bought mine off of Wish for like 2 dollars. It works great and I absolutely love not having to spend money on tampons. 
"Absolutely!!!! Used the lady cup for 9 years, had two back to back children and needed a different size. 

Been using the Ruby cup for a year. Bonus! For every purchase of a Ruby cup the company donates one to girls in Africa so they can continue to go to school!!

"I'm in love with my cup and recommend it to just about every woman I know My friends think I'm off, but I work for an environmental waste and I think that single use menstral products are awful. "
"Please be careful to ""break the seal"" when using a menstrual cup in tandem with an IUD because you otherwise run the risk of pulling it out of place. It's not likely, but it has happened to others and me. I've since invested in period panties to cope with the heavier (albeit less painful) period paragard has given me and I'm mostly happy with it. "
Great ideas. I got lucky with my bc and I only get a period every three months or so. 
Reusable pads and panty liners are also amazing. I‚Äôm allergic to adhesives and these solve that issue and are zero waste!!!

Dude same (4 years now) and it is GLORIOUS

I‚Äôm on my second IUD and haven‚Äôt had a period in over five years. And it was completely covered by my insurance. I love it and fortunately I‚Äôve had no negative side effects 
"I'm on an IUD and love it. Getting it put in, however, was much more painful than the 'heavy cramps' my doctor compared it to. And I've had cramps where I passed out from the pain! Not to hijack the conversation, but did you experience that too?"

Every good friend I have who's female, whenever periods come up in conversation, I practically start with, ""Have you heard the word of my lord and savior menstrual cup?"""
"Right?! It‚Äôs just another day now. 

My period actually got shorter too, but I also changed my diet and exercise levels. "
[deleted]
go for it :) 
"I did! Are you concerned about the comfort level? Cups are almost a world away from tampons because they're smoother, and have none of the rough dryness of tampons which I hated. Of course, the process/sensation takes some getting used to, but it's been worth it for me 100%. Cups are so much cleaner and comfortable than pads. I hope you'll give them a try! There is actually a quiz out there on putacupinit.com or something. Just search ""menstrual cup quiz"" if you're searching for a good fit for you."
"I was never able to use tampons, I went from pads to a cup with no problem (other than the normal learning curve!). It feels completely different than tampons."
"Wash it when you take it out, with soap and water. Wash your hands before you remove it, too.  Boil to disinfect if it makes you feel better. Diva cups are 100% medical grade silicone so it won‚Äôt damage the cup. "
"Little TMI here, but I have dealt with frequent UTIs and yeast infections most of my life, mostly triggered by diet and stress, but having a Diva cup has actually improved my hygiene. You definitely want to wash it when you take it out and put it back in, and wash your hands of course, but its far cleaner and more comfortable than having wads of cotten/synthetic scented stuff down there. I only boiled it once when I first bought it per instructions on the box, since then I just hand wash with soap and warm water and store it in the included bag, and just wash before I use it again. It definitely takes some getting used to, but it is well worth it."
Tss is only a problem with cups if you happen to have a scratch or something in your vaginal canal that would be in contact with the fluid accumulating in the cup. You can keep a cup in longer so it's safer than tampons for tss risk.
"well theres a much smaller risk of infection since its silicone rather than cotton, and if you use it right it shouldnt be a problem. you should check when you put it in that its airtight (if you pull the end a bit and it ""holds on"" that means its sealed and blood doesnt come in contact w air/the outside world. when taking out, you break the seal by pressing the cup. its the same reason airtight jars preserve food a long time). when cleaning it, people have different philosophies. i usually rinse it with clean water (water i would drink) when emptying and putting back in. i boil it in between periods. you can also clean it with unscented soap. its important, like with tampons, to wash your hands before."
"The cups are available at stores like Target or on Amazon. Diva cup is the big brand name, but there's also Luna cup and a few other smaller brands. Look for mentural cup when you're googling and searching. Be sure to read reviews to find one that works for you; some are a bit thinner, have smaller capacity, or are stiffer than others. It took me two tries to find a brand that worked for me, and my set of two cost me $12. Never going back to pads."
"my cup is a lunette and my pads are from imsevimse, but those are both scandinavian brands and i chose them for shipping reasons (im scandi) so i would recommend browsing for stuff close to you. some links to great subreddits in the comment thread here. pretty sure there is one for cloth pads as well IIRC. etsy is popular with cloth pad enthusiasts and if you view top posts in a subreddit dedicated to cloth pads or cups you can get better recs than i could give :) 
my tip is to try at least two brands/models before giving up on the idea. its a bit more money up front but chances are you find something great that cuts down your costs a lot and is better for your health!"
yes ive heard of that! there are several initiatives to introduce safe and reusable products in areas where women dont have access to menstrual products due to poverty/taboos about periods
"yes thanks for adding this! in all cases, breaking the seal makes for easy removal. i think many negative reviews ive read seem to relate to people trying to remove without squeezing first which can be painful."
i have sensitive skin so not putting it in contact w bleached cotton is really great! 
"it can take getting used to, but it doesnt work quite the same as tampons, so dont think the learning curve is all that much steeper going straight from pads. just make sure to relax, try things out slowly over a few periods and use panty liners (i have cloth ones now but started out w single use ones) if youre afraid of leaking. it takes a bit of practice to get the airtight seal right each time. remember not to panic if you have trouble taking it out at first - it wont go anywhere and you will get it out! relax, bear down with the kegel muscles, put a finger in and push the side of the cup to break the seal. then pull it by the little tail onthe end (i cut the tail really short for comfort but some prefer to keep it long. up to you)"
"oh and if you do it over the toilet it doesnt really matter ifit spills a bit :) if youre in a public toiletyou could bring a water bottle for rinsing, but ive been using mine for almost five years and have yet to need to empty it in a public toilet since they can be kept in for so long (12 hours if the seal is in place)

"its one of those costs that women havent been able to opt out of. its not really an injustice, just biology, except for a few places where female hygiene products are taxed as luxury items"
"The depo shot is the same way. I remember saying to my doctor ""You're telling me there's a magic shot that makes my period go away *and* it's birth control?! ...You need my arm or my booty?""

I feel like every woman with any reasonable health care access would be on the BC if that were more well known. "
Perfectly safe and happens to about 1/3 the women who are on the hormonal IUD. Copper IUDs can make bleeding worse. 
"Depo shot does the same thing and lasts 3 months at a time. I think it may be even more likely to make menstruation go away than IUD, if that's what you're after. At age 30 after discontinuing my period came back on the 4th month.

No, I don't work for a pharma company, etc. I just can't do IUDs or nuva-rings because my brain won't stop screaming ""that is not a storage area!"" at me. I know it's totally irrational, I'm working on it. :)"
"My Gyno gave me a pill that softens the cervix (which felt very strange...) and a numbing shot right to the cervix (which did not hurt). The insertion was strange feeling and hurt some and I was crampy afterwards, but my period cramps were worse. Overall it was more strange to me than painful, because I could feel insides that I‚Äôve never actively felt before. "
"It took me two tries as well. It's a pretty common issue, which is why I wanted to point it out!"
You would get so many girlfriend points by finding something she hasn't thought of and making it zero waste. Just saying.
"You only have to remove and rinse/wash it every 12 hours, then reinsert."
Yeah you're not supposed to leave a softcup in that long. 
"So they are disposable? Hmmm.
I only really use a tampon for the first day, after that it's pads. I've been thinking about the thinx or whatever undies, but this mightt be good too"

Mmh I never really thought about that.
The depo shot is all fine and dandy until you start to experience some of the worse side effects. My sister received the depo shot and within two weeks had completely changed from the happy go lucky girl I grew up with to an anxious suicidal mess. BE CAREFUL
I hope they told you about the bone density loss. You can't take it for more than five years in your lifetime. If it weren't for that I'd be on it for life cause I did great on it. 
I have a terrible reaction to the hormones in both. 
"Something to consider that my doctor informed me of was that with the shot, there is a possibility that the effects will stay much longer past the time you get your last shot. 

You sort of build it up over time and if you do plan on eventually wanting to have children you should plan on quitting the shot and moving to another birth control well in advance. Something like the pill or an IUD that doesn't build up.

He told me he has seen women unable to get pregnant months / year after not getting a shot but it seems to be case by case. I opted for the IUD instead just to avoid any possible infertility period in case I do change my mind and want kiddos sooner than I think. "
"Hey, you're right!"
"I was using a cup for the last few periods (wish I used it sooner), but I also got an IUD three months ago, and I haven't gotten a period. I hope I'm part of the 1/3. :D"
"yes definitely, i know several friends who bought one and gave up after a period or two, which i understand cause its not exactly a time when you want to go out of your comfort zone, but i also really want them to give it another try!"

I ended up watching some videos on it last night and they seem pretty straightforward except for hooooow so I know I got it in right?? 
I have a promo code for thinx if you want it too 
"I felt similarly about pads, lol. There are a lot of resources about cups and so many brands, sizes, softness levels, etc. nowadays, so hopefully you'll find the one for you. I'm really glad I did--won't go back to pads if I can help it. Good luck and have fun! "
"In First World countries we have advancing technology that can prevent serious infections like TSS (Toxic Shock Syndrome). TSS is a risk associated with leaving tampons in too long, but you can leave a menstrual cup in for ~12 hours, even when you're sleeping! It's actually an amazing thing I think everyone, everywhere should be using."
"i prefer ""vampire shot glass"" but blood cup works ;) and hey, you can keep using tampons, whatever is most comfortable for you"
Same experience here. I was on it for 3 years. Great experience. Then year 4 came... Total insanity. Never again.
"Thanks for the warning, but I've had multiple and that has not been my experience. My PCP is awesome and  only accepts patients with my particular neurodevelopmental disorder, we talk about side effects more than intended benefits of my meds most of the time.

The BC pill on the other hand, hoo buoy did that do a number on me. Pretty much same as your sis, just a downward spiral until I stopped that medication."
"Depo made me gain tons of weight, gave me acne, and made my periods wonky for two years. But, I've known some people who loved it. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
I  was suicidal on it and had bleeding every day for 3 months.
Did she just have to ride it out until the shot wore off or was there anything they could give her to lessen the side effects?
"I just got one in on Monday, I also hope I am part of the 1/3!

Also side question, have you had any partners complain about the strings? They poked my boyfriends penis enough to leave a mark/almost draw blood :("
Says softcup. They're for 12 hour use. 
"I'm always looking for a deal! :) I'll search for those videos, too. Thanks!"
"I'm glad it works for you, birth control is such a personal journey for us. I used depo for years and when I went off it I realized I had a lot of the side effects but mainly I was concerned about the calcium depletion. "
I gained about 15lb and never wanted to have sex. So birth control win? 
"She was under psychiatric care, of her own free will, until the shot wore off. It really scared her and she would have moments of clarity where she was fine and then instantly switch back. It was horrible."
"Aw man, I'm going to sound lame, but I haven't even slept with anyone since I got it. 

... :( 

I'VE BEEN A HERMIT LATELY, ALRIGHT? HAHA!

At first, I was like, ""Dude. I can totally feel these strings."" But I don't think it would be to the point of poking? Did your doctor do an ultrasound a month later to verify the position of it? My friend has it, and she said her partners never mention it at all."
"They soften up over time! When they are brand new they are still quite stiff.

If they are too long, you could also have you gyno trim them. If too short- then yikes haha. No fixing that without another IUD."
"My OBGYN said no sex for a week or maybe 2 to lessen the risk of PID. Very serious condition and I'd check with your doc or a pharmacy to see what's recommended for your device.
You should already have a follow-up appointment booked with the doctor who put it in. They'll ensure it has remained in place (mine did an ultrasound to see) and that you're not having any discomfort or unmanageable side effects. Mention it to them then and they should be able to trim the strings. Unfortunately the strings have to be long enough that you can feel them with your fingers to be sure you haven't ejected the device. 
Also, with time and body heat the strings will soften and curl along the vaginal wall so they aren't poking straight down through your cervix, but sticking to the contour of your body."
"You shouldn't be able to feel the strings during intercourse. If your partner can feel them, your gynecologist can trim them. "
I'm so sorry she had to experience that.  How long did it take for the shot to wear off?
"I‚Äôm hoping they will curl over time, I read that too short might be worst, like stubbly beard lol"
"I have no side effects whatsoever so I am lucky I suppose. I have a follow up appointment in two months with the gyno. She didn‚Äôt tell me anything about waiting for sex, damn. We ended up using a condom cuz it poked him too bad."
Depends though! I'm on my 2nd IUD and my 1st one definitely were way too long at first. Way less of an issue once i had them trimmed to about 3 or 4 cm. But yeah too short sounds rough too!

"Those vitamins and minerals you're missing are pretty important (they all are, really). Do you take a supplement? If it helps you, this guy here at Efficiency is Everything made a list of the cheapest sources (using his diet) of all the essential vitamins and minerals -- included fortified foods. [https://efficiencyiseverything.com/food-nutrition-per-dollar/](https://efficiencyiseverything.com/food-nutrition-per-dollar/)

Luckily, eggs, vitamin D milk, corn oil, and an ounce of kale a day might be all you need to add, and all of those are super cheap and should fit well under the $2/day budget (well, except the kale. But you don't need a lot, and it packs a whopping amount of nutrition for like $1-2 per week.)"
"If you ever need some variety, check out the Good and Cheap cookbook by Leanne Brown. She aims for $4 a day so maybe a splurge meal but recipes are also for multiple people so you could do it on the cheap for yourself. It's an oldie but a goodie! 
https://www.leannebrown.com/cookbooks/

Edit: Also she gives the cookbook away digitally for free. It's supposed to be about saving money, after all."
"Dude if it works for you, great.  I don't see anything more out of whack than most diets, but of course when you put everything up visually like that people can poke holes in anything.  I appreciate the cronometer pic- always interesting to see how these plans stack up.  I think at one point when I was dieting and poor, I figured out that something like almonds, oj, beans, and spinach would cover literally everything you needed lol.  Something like that.  Fun program for sure.  
   
Depending on egg prices where you are, removing some of the starch and going with eggs instead would balance it out a bit IMO.  But that's just a matter of opinion- 100g protein is definitely enough for most people.  I get eggs for $1/doz at Aldi, so call it 0.10 per egg... I'd take out half those oats (that's too much oats for me) and do 2 eggs."
"As an avid weightlifter (I'm not nutrition expert) but going from obese to lean has taught me a few things... I can tell you this diet is basically a pathway to obesity. In no way does this plan make sense from the standpoint of ""everything in moderation"" or getting critical fat (for joint health, cell regeneration, keeping your body warm, and for digestive health). The real issue I'm referring to is the amount of starchy carbs. Having a nearly 1 to 10 to 40 ratio mix of fat to protein to and carbs is far from optimal. So severely far from optimal that it's nearly unwise. For the average person a mix of 30% fat, 30% protein, and 40% carbs would work. 

Although this may diet be cheap and keep you moving; why be cheap on what fuels your body? If you feed yourself crap, your body ends up like crap. There are easy ways to save on food and get the exact same stuff that you did before, but drastic measures like this are not sustainable long-term; hence, imo are useless. "

Tuna was 25-50 cents a can back then.  Loaf of cheap ass bread was $1.  Ramen 5-10 cents.  Eventually I started buying whole chickens and roasting them.  God I thought my life was complete after that hahahaha."

I have a masters degree in nutrition and dietetics for anyone who wants to downvote me bc that seems to be the trend when I spew correct nutrition information üôÉ"
Other days may have a lot of eggs/chicken/pork which have a good amount of fat. I don't find fat very filling or cheap a lot of the time and if it isn't filling I would risk over eating it. 
"I do supplement most vitamins and vary my diet every day to avoid any specific vitamin being deficient.

I don't plan on ever not restricting/counting calories and I recently lost about 45 pounds and am just kinda shoring up in the 125-130 range. 

This day was quite heavy in carbs, but I do not eat the rice every day, nor the oatmeal. I tend to stick to the beans, lentils, chicken, and other complex protein/carbohydrate sources that are relatively inexpensive. "
Very true. That much carbs (even if their complex) is a pathway to obesity for most people.

"You might have a master's degree in nutrition but you're not an MD. u/BruceBringsthings is right about hormones being off when you aren't consuming enough fat. 

I don't understand why you brought up lipids as an argument against hormones? Lipids (commonly referred to as lipid hormones e.g. testosterone, estrogen, etc.) are one of the three main branches of hormones. Your statement backs Bruce's. But that fact aside...your cell regeneration, digestive health, and joints will suffer on a low fat diet. Other than the hormone misunderstanding, you are correct (there is a lot of misinformation regarding fat)."
"No...I meant hormonal profile. 50g of fat a day is a practical minimum to keep your hormonal levels where they should be.  22g of fat (depending on level of EFA) is clearing  'required for survival' but way missing the 'ideal/optimal' bar. 

I agree with your 20-35% stat.  This day's diet is under 10% with basically no EFAs.  So severely lacking.

"So what's your average daily cost for food across say a week or a month?  This seems like a shitty way to get attention, by just cherry picking your most nutrient-deficient day because it's less than $2 in foods and making it seem like it's the norm for you."
"Pill form vitamins tend to have extremely awful absorption rates, no matter the brand.

You'd be better off long-term healthwise spending a bit more on food that's more than simply filling. There is frugal and there is the ramen diet (yours is glorified ramen diet). "

"During my first visit to a Dermatologist (wanting to get a pesky mole removed) the Nurse was asking me questions until the doc came in.  One of the first was, ""Do you apply sunscreen every day?""  I was a bit floored as a 40+ yr old.  I always thought sunscreen was for the beach or laying by the pool."
Simply using something like crono to be conscious of the micronutrients makes a huge difference.  I'm sure OP's plan is better than 75% of people who aren't tracking this stuff.
"If you're looking for cheap options, milk and eggs. Those are both complete foods and have the appropriate mix of fat to protein (and carbs if you choose milk).

Other than that meats like chicken and beef are incredibly cheap for what you can do with them. Just buy a good cookbook for quick but healthy recipes (The Naked Chef by Jamie Oliver) to help you out. "
That's why you weigh your food and track all your calories! 
Maybe he found them at a discount grocery or something. Or found them at a good deal.  What's with the snobby attitude dude.
OP may just think of all oats as Quaker brand. There is only one brand of band-aid.

Beans (or lentils) + Rice = protein.
"Lentils and beans have a really high carb to protein ratio (2.5 to 1 for lentils, 3 to 1 for beans).  For me to get 100g of protein a day from those sources would require 250-300g of carbs.  I'm feeling lethargic already just thinking about that many carbs in one day... "
"This is the norm though. I don't tend to ever exceed $2-3 a day... Spend more one day spend less another. Missing 20%-30% of 2-3 vitamins is hardly ""Deficient"". The 30 cents on tomato sauce and 20 cents on spices aren't necessary they are little excesses. Some days the costs are below $1.25-$1.30... "

Thanks! 
"Definitely eat a lot of chicken and pork, had some eggs but ran out. I am not a huge fan of dairy I just don't do well digesting it. "
"No that's why you create a balanced diet that has an appropriate amount of fat, enough carbs but not to much, and enough protein. "
Yeah it's a magic combo. Complementary amino acid profiles ftw.
"Depends on your activity level, but for my height and weight 330 - 480 carbs is a completely acceptable range. Besides, you don't feel them if they're complex and nutrient dense. "
"> Some days the costs are below $1.25-$1.30

Bullshit.  At those prices (assuming you're somewhere like the midwest where food is typically cheaper here), you're filling your day with rice, peanut butter, and white bread; there's not much else you can buy at >1500 cal/dollar, and certainly nothing that will give you a balanced nutritional profile.

Stop selling this meal plan as healthy."
"Right...plan is trash for your body plain and simple. You wouldn't put diesel in a gasoline engine, so why would you put so much trash into your body? Yeah their might be a vegetable here and there but missing really important nutrients like *calcium* is not a minor issue. Neither is lacking Vitamin E is what your body uses to detox free radicals, it's  not ok to go without it. One thing to not go cheap on is food because it has effects on more than your wallet like your mood, your health, your hormones, your body fat, your cell regeneration, etc. etc. the list goes on and on and on. 

I always get sick seeing these plans promoting an unhealthy diet then adding in later in the comments ""oh on other days I eat chicken, steak, eggs, milk, etc. "" Which aren't cheap foods...so why is the OP posting false information about a ""cheap"" diet when OP doesn't even follow it??? These diets are useless Karma creators unless you actually follow it. I would rather see a diet that says ""I can eat on $10 a day and get the right macro and nutrient profiles, here's how"""
"Couple of eggs, tablespoon or two of nutritional yeast, some broccoli, beans, oatmeal, lentils and use a bit of olive oil in some of the cooking would be pretty complete. I don't have the exact prices, but you don't need large amounts of vegetables to get their nutrients. Eggs are dirt cheap, nutritional yeast is like 10-15 cents a serving. Lentils, beans, and oatmeal are all sub 10 cents a serving. 

Only end up a little short on vita E and Calcium almost 100 grams of protein. "
"But those extra ingredients are not in your plan. You are just adding things after the fact to try to defend a fake cheap nutrition plan. The fact that you have 100 grams of protein doesn't make it ok that you are eating only 22 grams of fat while taking in 300+ grams of carbs. Your ratio of fat, carbs, and protein is literally 1:18:5...no dietitian would ever even consider your plan. "

"The sky is blue because there are particles which refract light blah blah blah‚Ä¶

No opinion on that song or the Blue Man Group. I wonder if the Blue Man Group know the Smurfs...

I like light blue and I don't know how hex colour codes work so let's just say the shade of blue of the ""Weekly topic"" tag.

Never ate cordon bleu, I think it's some kind of chicken though.

Blue is my favourite colour! It's even my flair!"
">Why is the sky blue?

Because...something something science. It isn't really. 

>Thoughts on the I'm Blue song? Thoughts on The Blue Man Group?

I'm Blue was fun but I won't be sad if I never hear it again ever in my entire life. The Blue Man Group is cool. 

>What color of blue do you like - give me a hex color code?

00BF2FF

>Ever eat le cordon bleu, what'd you think about it?

I have not. But I believe there's a school in CA where chefs teach who all come from there. You can eat incredible food by the students for super cheap and all they ask for is feedback. 

>What does the color blue mean to you?

The endless expanse of possibility. : ) 

EDIT: removed hashtag of hex code to unbold

[Blue.](https://youtu.be/r5sKRNYsDME)
"My first thought is the album [Blue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8ZESu3BpPA&list=PLWnVxuqvY7JgyYmz0XuiTTwas-PmXclNJ) (1971) by Joni Mitchell. The album also contains an individual song called [Blue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5782PQO5is). It's widely considered one of her best albums, if not the best, and it is *the* Joni album on relationships. I'll say that depending on the day it might be a little too sappy for me, and it is not my absolute favourite work by her. Still, other days it is a phenomenal album. The passion Joni puts in and the quality of her work are tangible, in my opinion. 

My favourite track is [The last time I saw Richard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igj20M84hbo)."
I love the song blue. I even have blue hair!
"[Vanilla Blue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ebhk63N6f70) by Naked Raygun is a jam. 

Never seen that movie *I Am Curious (Blue)* but that's one hell of a pretentions title. "
Hmm... I saw Blue Man Group once. Incredible. The shade of blue they paint themselves with is my favorite.  
"If you look away from the sun, blue light travelling from the sun through the earth‚Äôs atmosphere (but not directly toward you) is scattered by the molecules toward your eye.

Thus the sky looks blue because scattering from molecules is much more probable for blue light than red."
"French Moire from Sherwin Williams is my new favourite blue shade (**Hex Value:** \#9fbbc3). We have our bedroom painted this colour and I loved it so much I ended up doing the rest of the house in the same shade (lightened by 20&#37; though). I think the best part is that it turns different shades of blue depending on the lighting. In the morning it's a darker blue, but by afternoon it's lighter, then sometimes in the evening it's a purple blue. 

That said and blue has always been a great colour for relaxation. Maybe because it reminds people of the sky? It's said to calm babies brains too (so great for a nursery). Which makes me think that it just shuts our mind down to be more relaxed while louder colours like yellow make us more energized."
"1. Rayleigh scattering right?  
  
2. Da ba dee, da ba die, my friend. Saw Blue Man Group in Boston years ago. Very fun.  
  
3. Oh jeez, hex code? I'll just say I like blue that's darker than the sky but lighter than whatever regular blue is.  
  
4. Love a good chicken cordon bleu.  
  
5. It's my dad's favorite color, and I suppose I quite like the color as well. I think blue eyes on a person is a huge turn-on."
[Regina Spektor - Blue Lips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccZuKOTb6ug) is one of my favourite songs. You guys should listen to it too. It's a bit depressing tho ( or a bit blue. kek )
"You know, I‚Äôve never really liked blue. To me, it‚Äôs almost a neutral color, almost like beige, like a non-color. I do like blue-green mixtures though. Green is my favorite color. "
"1. Colour wavelengths.  
2. I quite like the song, and the Blue Man Group are interesting.  
3. #112d91  
4. I have not.  
5. Blue. It's...blue. I haven't thought of any personal significance."
"Favorite blue: most blues
Least favorite blue: that frickin ugly ass menards looking crunch bar wrapper blue"
"blue reminds me of comfort. as for the song, it annoys me."
"Blue is my favorite color. Apparently, a little over half of all people feel the same, which makes me believe that we all really do see colors the same. (Not counting colorblind people obviously lol.)"
"I read awhile back that humans didn't always 'see' the color blue as distinctive enough to merit its own name.

https://thedoctorweighsin.com/evolution-of-the-color-blue/amp/#referrer=https://www.google.com&amp_tf=From%20%251%24s"
"Blue has always been my favorite color. If my spirit had a color, it would be blue. When I was little, everything I loved was blue. The sky was blue. The ocean was blue. My favorite blanket I liked to hide under was blue. Articuno was my favorite legendary and Squirtle was my favorite starter, because they were blue. If I had to change my name for some reason, I would call myself Blue.

I don't know the hex code for my favorite shade in particular, but looking around Google images brought me [here](https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1CALEAL_enUS745US747&biw=1536&bih=723&tbm=isch&sa=1&ei=6aFKW-fQI-v4jwTbxpLACA&q=Electric+Blue+Chalcanthite&oq=Electric+Blue+Chalcanthite&gs_l=img.3..0i24k1.72838.76333.0.76893.14.9.0.0.0.0.118.740.1j6.7.0....0...1c.1.64.img..12.2.218.0..0j0i67k1.0.THKmTL6sDHY). I think that's my current aesthetic. "
"Blue is love. When we were in school we have this line Blue Blue, God bless you:P"
There‚Äôs got to be a better way to say that. 
XD
wait a second. the whole movie is just a narration over a blue screen?
It‚Äôs name literally means beyond the sea... Latin and shit. 
No! ;)
"No, can you tell me? "
you might say the [blues run the game?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpDsPb9aZFs)
That sounds pretty nice! I've added it to the playlist I listen to when I want something different from my usual picks.
"I had to take a Color Theory course in college, and there's some really weird stuff that color can do to your brain. I don't have any specific stories about blue, but pink is a weird one. If you put an agitated person in a pink room, they will calm down. However, if you leave them in the room for too long, the aggression will return and generally be worse than it was originally.

Also strange, some of the effects we've seen from color on people can also be seen in blind people. Meaning color has an effect on the brains of people who don't even know what color they are in. Pretty crazy. I wish I had some links.

I'm going to look into that shade you mentioned, I've been wanting to paint and I love a blue-grey scheme."
"I felt that way for a long time, but I've started to love very deep, rich blues recently. They have a sort of warmth to them that's hard to describe.

I'll always love green though :)"
"> \#112d91

Oh that's a nice color.  I favor the deeper blues over the lighter shades.
"
"Yep! Sounds boring, but it was actually pretty captivating and inspiring."
"The Beatles Yellow Submarine movie. There is a character called the Blue Meanie.

Maybe it *is* too obscure."
"Thank you, I needed that.

Long ago, I heard it said, 'Wherever the blues are being played, there can be no sadness.'  Maybe only bittersweetness ;)"
"Well well, what do we have here? I've spotted a fellow Laura Marling fan in the wild! What's your favourite LM song?

E: I actually had [A hard rain's a-gonna fall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHk6DODhkGg&list=RDMMEHk6DODhkGg&start_radio=1) playing and had to pause it to listen to blues run the game."
"That is super interesting! Now I feel like going down the rabbit hole that is google.  It seems like it'd be fun to read and research.

As for the colour, it's amazing. I really recommend getting it lightened up a bit (I think it was 10 or 20&#37; for our living room) if it's a place that needs more natural light, like the kitchen. It pairs nicely with grey too, we have a grey entry room and I love it. I'm currently on the hunt for a light grey for the bathroom too."
It seems like I end up liking anything that people will describe as cobalt blue.
"Haha maybe. It's before my time though, so perhaps I'm just not hip enough."
I love Yellow Submarine! The soundtracks made me cry a bit. Need to watch that again.
"Also [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bk_OKZj838&index=2&t=0s&list=FLy5dNCNaQKsWi3vdB_VCORA) is my go to for all moods at all times, sorry I have nothing else to offer but music but I hope it helps :p"
"Awww that's sweet, I hope you have a wonderful day!"
"Wow picking a fouvarite is definitely not possible maybe 1 from each album? 

Alas I cannot swim - Shine
I speak because I can - I speak because I can
A creature I don't know - I was just a card 
Once I was an eagle - When were you happy(and how long has it been)
Short movie - Easy
Semper Femina - the valley

Sorry for the expansive list! I'd love to hear what your favourites are."
"Well I also just found out it's a really lame wrestler, so maybe people think I mean that."
"That's a pretty song, thanks for sharing.
The well wish you sent helps. I've got perspective again, which I'm getting better at finding because of practice, lol.

I remember that God loves me and put my sights back upon God, and then stuff down here doesn't get to me as much.  FWIW, that's a big panacea by itself."
"No problem, I knew it was a provocative question. I love Easy, too (How did I get lost looking for God... *in Santa Cruz*?!). My absolute favourite might be Goodbye England (Covered in Snow). Well actually, I'll play the choose-a-favourite-from-each-album game too:

Alas I cannot swim - The captain and the hourglass  
I speak because I can - Goodbye England (covered in snow)  
A creature I don't know - Don't ask me why  
Once I was an eagle - I was an eagle  
Short Movie - Easy  
Semper Femina - Nouel"
You know honestly she has so many good songs those are the fucking bomb too... We don't deserve her
"You've reached ""Onederland"".  When the first number on the scale changes from a 2 to a 1!
It's an amazing feeling isn't it? Congratulations that's so awesome! "
"You have achieved a life goal, amazing in it's own right. I wish you luck in your continued progress. :) ü§ûüëç"
Congratulations! 
"CONGRATULATIONS! I am so impressed and happy for you! Self improvement and love is the best gift you can give yourself! Please share some of your discipline with me, I need to stop smoking (killing myself slowly right!?) but I suck at quitting. "
Congrats! Don't forget being physically active too. 
"Get yo money! Get yo money! 
Congrats! "
"Thats awesome friend! Congrats. 

What changes have you made? What kind of exercise and diet are you on?"
Congratulations! 
Congrats!  You are killing it!  Hiking is amazing- so good for you physically and mentally. 
Congratulations!  Reaching weight loss goals is awesome.
"Congrats OP! Losing weight can be pretty tough, but it feels great when you manage it."
"Awesome!
Keep at it and congratulations!"
I'm so proud of you!! Great effort and stick-to-it-iveness! x.
That's awesome!
Congrats! I‚Äôve been at 203 for 4 weeks I‚Äôm stalled so hard. 64 pounds down since the first of the year and I want so bad to hit this goal. I am glad you made it hopefully I can soon too!
Congratulations!!
"Congrats that is awesome!  I know that feeling! I am currently at 175 and i started at 240 about 6 months ago! The good news is that you made it past the hardest part, which is the beginning it gets easier :) keep it up"
"That‚Äôs fantastic! I‚Äôm on my own journey to a healthier me, and I know how difficult the process is. Best wishes on your continued success!"
"To those using metric units, it's 90,72 kilograms."
"This makes me wonder how long of my life has been over 200 vs under. Would have hit 200 the first time at 21. Didn‚Äôt go under again until 36. Currently bouncing around 225-230. Need to get back on the stop eating so damn much diet. 

Great job by the way. I was about 280 before I finally managed to lose a lot. Got down to 176 before my daughter showed up and wrecked any progress I had made :) Not really her fault of course. Just failed to adjust. "
I thought you were upset that you were under ¬£200 before I read the obese part.
"FUCK YEAH!!! congrats!! There is nothing harder than breaking past that wall when it feels like your effort is going nowhere. 
So much respect. "
Congratulations! What a great day! I‚Äôm proud of all the work you‚Äôve done to get here! Keep it up! 
Congrats!  I myself am working on this as well!  Just a few years ago I was at 165 and then depression and stress kicked in and so did the weight gain. How are you accomplishing your goals?
"Very well done! I'm trying to get to about 160, but it's really hard. "
"Congrats!  I crossed the 200 mark earlier this year too.  Feels great, doesn't it?"
WOOOOOOO!!!!!
Yes! Thank you and IM PROUD OF YOU TOO!
Woe
Thank you!!
"Awesome!
"
"Once you get to your target weight, be sure to learn HOW to eat to maintain the new weight. Look at something like the Mediterranean diet, for example. It is a good mix of veggies and lean meats, and you eat small portions all day long to maintain your sugar levels.

Congrats on the weight loss and keep it off!"
"I‚Äôm soooo happy for you! A lot of people are told to love their bodies no matter what, which I agree with, but you can still try to change it for a healthier life. Changing to be more healthy isn‚Äôt the same as not loving yourself and your body. Congratulations!"
Congrats and keep up the good work. 
"I know I‚Äôm just a stranger on the internet, but I wanna let you know I‚Äôm so proud of you!! keep working towards your goal! "
Congratulations on the milestone! Keep up the good work and keep making progress!
So amazing! I‚Äôm down 72 pounds!!! 
Thank you sooooo much!!!
Thank you!!
"Well i was smoking a pack a day for years I quit in January. I knew i was having weight loss surgery and I also knew they wouldn‚Äôt operate if i had nicotine in my system so I just quit, cold turkey. And now that I‚Äôve had the surgery for the sole purpose of LIVING there‚Äôs no FUCKING way I‚Äôd smoke again, ever. 
Edit: You can do it. You should do it. "
Nicorette lozenges were a life savor for me. I went from a pack a day to *just* lozenges literally over night. And over the course of several weeks simply reduced the amount of lozenges each day until I no longer needed them. They‚Äôre expensive but worth every penny. 
Yes! Been crushing the white mountains!
Yayyy!!!!
"I had weight loss surgery back in March. I lost the initial 15 pounds the month prior to surgery simply by calorie control and eating very clean. The next 45 pounds came off quit rapidly after surgery. I went two months without losing despite only eating clean and weighing all my food out. But the past month I finally started losing again. I hike A LOT and when I‚Äôm not hiking I‚Äôm doing spin and body conditioning at the gym. I‚Äôve found the hiking has been invaluable, Prob the best exercise I could get. I meal prep for everything, if I go out i beg to order off the children‚Äôs menu and try to keep it to meat and veggies. I stopped drinking alcohol completely, i don‚Äôt drink any carbonation and try to consume copious amounts of water. "
Thank you!!
Thank you so much!
Thank you! I‚Äôm proud of me too!
Thank you!!
YOULL DO IT! It‚Äôs so frustrating! Try hiking lol that‚Äôs what did it for me!
Ugh. I've lost 20 and now I've stalled at 207 for the past 4 weeks! I haven't been under 200 since grade school and I want it sooo bad haha. Keep going friend 64 pounds is a great start!
Right back at you l! You can do it!
What he said!
"Hey you created a life be gentle with yourself! You got there once you‚Äôll get there again! Smaller meals more often, weigh everything. I don‚Äôt know how any parent manages to stay in shape I can barely take care of myself lol"
That stall nearly broke me haha
Thank you so much!
"Well I had weight loss surgery which has been a really awesome tool. But beyond that I make good choices in terms of food, I weigh everything and i exercise every day."
So hard but just stay focused i know you can do it!
Oh yeah it really is! 200 was actually more exciting then 199 for some reason.
!!!!
Yes!! I eat basically chicken and veggies all the time üôÑ it‚Äôs boring but it‚Äôs working
"Wow, nice job! It's a lot of had work and determination, you should be damn proud of yourself! üéâüéâüéâ"
Nice! Keep going and be your best! :)
Way to go! You are doing and have done so great.
You're doing a great job! Hiking sounds lovely
Thanks for the kind words! ! Funny enough I have been thinking of taking up hiking as a good healthy fun exercise! I‚Äôm nearly complete on my second read through of AWOL on the Appalachian Trail which is extremely entertaining and highly motivating if you are interested in a hiking book! Hiking the AT would be an incredible bucket list item now that I‚Äôm back to a less heavy weight!
Thank you! I have been doing Keto since 1/1/18 and the pounds fell off fast! I hit a nasty stall back in March around 233 and was stuck there for about 3 weeks so this isn‚Äôt my first stall but I want to see 199 for the first time in like 12 years in the worst way! Keep up the great work it will come for both of us soon!!!!!
Thank you! I've gotten to the point where I feel I should just accept my current weight
It‚Äôs lovely at the top and when it‚Äôs over hahaha
If you are anywhere near NH lmk we can link up for a hike!
Did you change anything to break the stall or did you just wait it out?
"Maybe one day I‚Äôll make it up there! Congrats again on your weight loss and powering through the stall! I can‚Äôt wait to have that incredible feeling you have had! Good luck with your ultimate goal, hopefully no more 2 month stalls!!!"
Around that time I started doing IF. First I dropped breakfast and did 16/8 and that helped break the stall. Since then I transitioned to OMAD and still am doing that most days (every now and then I have lunch or breakfast depending on the day). I like to think I just trusted the process and kept going. This times been much harder though. I want to hit 200 it‚Äôs my first goal and when I did I was going to treat myself so I‚Äôve been having cravings galore but still haven‚Äôt cheated at all on my diet. 
"The spontaneous, simple ones have been the best in my experience, especially when there's time to talk and find out we like being together.  

One of the most memorable was when a co-worker and I were leaving work on a snowy December day.  She mentioned that she would like to see the Holiday lights downtown, so I suggested we go.  Right then.  We wound up driving and walking around most of the evening, seeing the lights, sights, ice skaters, a band, and generally feeling all warm and fuzzy.  "
"I‚Äôm so happy for you!  I‚Äôve been through a rough time this week, romantically, but this post honestly made me feel better, just from the sheer happiness of it.  I‚Äôm really glad that you met someone you click with like that, and I hope you and her go on many more amazing dates :)"
"Years ago when I was younger. First date with an ex of mine. We got into a conversation about greatest fears. I admitted one of mine was heights and this building in the city I was afraid of because of it. He ended up driving me all the way into the city just to park in a 'no parking' zone, run up, slap the building, take a picture, then run back to the car for safety. We then simply turned around and drove all the way back in the middle of the night. Most ridiculous thing ever. We are still friends to this day. "
"I went to a cat cafe for an okcupid date. The date itself was honestly boring... but I went back later and adopted a cat I met on the date. Lol. 
So i guess things still worked out in a way. Ahaha"
"I didn‚Äôt go on a traditional date with my (now) husband until about a year into our relationship. We were so broke in college, but we never minded! 
The first ‚Äúdate‚Äù was going to his friends house. He texted me out of the blue and asked for me to join his game night. While attempting to cuddle up close, he farted. Loudly. I honestly thought it was the kid to the board game closing. Years later the best man at our wedding told me the truth during the speech! "
"My boyfriend (now fiance) and I once climbed on to the roof of a gamestop to drink Japanese sodas from the world market and watch the sunset. Sometimes you just know. I'm happy for you, it sounds like you guys have a great connection!"
"One of my first ‚Äúdates‚Äù with my son‚Äôs dad involved him forcing me to drive. I was 19 and absolutely PETRIFIED of driving, had only done it once or twice before when my dad had forced me to, which only made me more scared of it (my dad is not, uh, a gentle spoken kind of guy and I‚Äôve always been super sensitive!)

Anyway, we were headed to his grandparents house on a small stretch of highway between our hometown and theirs. It‚Äôs pretty clear most of the time, like it was that night. Mid-drive and suddenly he pulled over, looked me in the eye and said ‚Äúit‚Äôs time, you can do this.‚Äù I remember those words but honestly don‚Äôt remember how much I protested, I‚Äôm sure I did. I probably cried. I likely can‚Äôt really remember because at that time my mind went white with fear.
Eventually though I switched him seats and got behind that wheel. And you know what? I drove. With his careful and gentle instructions I drove us the ten minutes or so left to his grandparents house, and in that stretch of time I realized a lot of my fears (mostly stemming from the two crashes I had been in in the recent years where, naturally, I was not driving) weren‚Äôt logical. I felt a great weight coming off of me that had been hanging SO heavily there for years. It was sort of an epiphany, I guess. That drive was the shove in right  direction that I needed. 

I got my license shortly after, and we always told that story to people while exchanging shy grins with one another. It was nice. We don‚Äôt have any kind of communication now for various reasons, but it‚Äôs a sweet memory I have of him. "
"I've got no stories to tell because I've never been on a date, but congratulations! It sounds like such a great time and I'm so glad you could have that! Have fun tomorrow, and invite me to the wedding ;)"
"I have to tell you, this isn't an ""unorthodox date"" at all. Maybe a little cheap, but amazing. The laughs and conversation you had would never have happened on a ""dinner and a movie"" date. This is great! 

I've been with my girlfriend for three years. We also met through an app and our first date was frozen yogurt. One of the laziest dates I've ever been on. I wasn't even looking for a date, let alone a relationship (I just wanted to flirt with women online). But we totally hit it off. It was so casual that I got to see the real her and loved what I saw. Our second date was a trip to the zoo. It wasn't until our third date that we actually dressed up and went on a traditional date. By that time we were comfortable with each other, I already really liked her, and now I got to see her dressed to the nines.

I wouldn't change a thing. "
"This is why you always have your first date at a grocery store. You learn a lot about each other and run an errand at the same time.

Romance: now a little more efficient. "
"I am glad you had a good date.  Any date that includes talking and laughing is good.  My husband and I went to dinner and dancing on our first date, but we talked and talked and talked.  The date was on Friday night, we talked all night, all the way home, over ice cream, fell asleep talking and talked over oatmeal for breakfast.  Now most of our dates are going for a run on Tuesday night and talking and laughing and complaining that that particular hill is entirely too steep to run up.

Let us know how your more ""normal"" date goes.  I hope it's as good as your unorthodox one."
"I took a crush to a gun range once, and taught her how to shoot. We had a fantastic time and went for coffee after, spent hours talking, even though we had been fairly close online friends before she moved to my city we seemed to discover a ton about one another.  Unfortunately she didn't see it as a *date* date, shot me down pretty hard, and we went our separate ways. She's married now I think? 

... Another gal I was set up with, we went for a moonlight photography walk on some trails bear a lake. We made jokes about letting her carry the bear deterrent pepper spray to let her friends feel like she was safer. We forgot the pepper spray in my truck, and of course encountered a bear. 
I made her hot cocoa with marshmallows at the side of the lake in my backpacking stove, and taught her how to take super long exposure photos in near darkness. 
She shot me down fairly kindly and gently, and I see her occasionally and we are friendly, but haven't really talked since. 

Oh well. "
"Originally, it was a standard first date. We went out to eat, then held hands as we walked around a park downtown.  


After about 15 minutes of walking, this guy drives by, speakers blairing, no sound insulation in his car so you can hear his bolts nearly rattling out of his trunk, lights dimming.   


She looks at this guy driving past, and sees he's going to the pier half a mile down the road where we were walking to. She then turns to me and laughs. ""Okay, how about we show that guy what a proper sound system sounds like.""  


This takes me by surprise. She leads me back to her car, a red tahoe, apparently one of her hobbies was working on her car for speaker battles...... and it showed.  


So here we are, driving up the pier, 11pm at night, blaring [Die Antwoord's Banana Brain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXlZfc1TrD0) at max volume, our date turning into an inpromptu speaker battle.  


After about an hour of flexing, and emotionally neutering this guy after he realized that it wasn't my car, but my date's. we turned the volume down and just chilled out passing the aux cable back and forth with the seats leaned back."
"just recently went for (objectively bad) pizza with this rad dude I met at work this past year. we wound up at an outdoor symphony where we shared our first kiss, it was super cute! I love hearing stories like this!"
What‚Äôs your overall experience with tinder been?
"We got drunk in a parking garage, talked and people watched for like an hour after we went to an arcade."
"Having a first date where you just click is the absolute best! your comment made me so happy and nostalgic! Most unorthodox first date goes to an ex I dated for a year. We drove around looking for things to do and spotted a Michael's (the arts and crafts store). We decided ""hey why not paint and watch Bob Ross while we do it?"" Best first date I've ever been on "
I once went to a bookstore for a first date and we walked around and discussed books. 
"Reading your post got me happy just by knowing that you're happy. For real man, great luck with this girl.
Now telling my story: Me and this girl jumped over a fence and invaded a zoo after it was closed. The surprising lack of guards or any type of security or surveillance system made it quite chill, but we were still trespassing so it was kind of exciting. It got dark pretty soon after we got there so we weren't able to see all the animals we wanted to, though. The jaguar and the bears we wanted particularly to see, but I think they put them in some other enclosure at night that was not visible for us. We got into this dark room and I fucking freaked out when I saw that there was a fuckload of bats (not fruit-bats, the ugly, scary ones) flying freely and wanting to kill me (yes, I'm a bit dramatic), but she made me go through the room and we got out at the other end of the dark room. We then proceeded to see the snake room, which I had to convince her to go, (what kind of person isn't afraid of flying free blood sucking monsters but is afraid of slow moving, and caged reptiles?) but we did it anyways. We got lost a few times, since it was really dark in the zoo, but eventually got out and made fun of one another for being afraid of bats and snakes. There was a bit of tension between us, because we had already gone out before and nothing had happened, but while we were in the zoo it almost vanished and we just had a good time talking and looking at the animals. Sadly we didn't steal no monkeys though, as tempting as that was."
"Last week my bf took me to an automatic car wash because i had never been to one before. We went through a tunnel on a conveyor belt, picked all the fancy options, and had a greasy fast food burger in the car. "
"Your story was so cute!!! I've totally done that romance novel thing with friends before, it's always a good time üòÅ Hope you guys have a great time on your next date!

And it's not super strange, but the most unorthodox date I've even been was going over to her house early in the morning to make pancakes together. We just put on some music, talked the whole time, took turns at the griddle, and ate together on her couch. I haven't had a whole lot, but I think that was my fav date yet ! ü•ûü•û"
"at 7pm i called up the girl i was seeing and went ‚Äúit‚Äôs the last day of halloween horror nights at universal, and i decided i really wanna go. come with me?‚Äù we were 16 and about to take a pretty major exam in half a week but it didn‚Äôt matter, i was head over heels for her and really wanted to do something that night.

turns out, our parents both wanted us to bring our younger brothers (we‚Äôre both girls so they thought it was a friend hangout) so we actually did, and the whole night was me holding her hand and sneaking cheek kisses while the two brothers walked in front of us - it was really a perfect night. our relationship fell apart almost immediately after we graduated and we were an absolute mess together, but i remember her dad seeing her hold my hand in the back of his car and told her in private that i seemed like a really good girl.

:) i think that was definitely the highlight of my first relationship "
"That's awesome, OP! But, listen to this cautionary tale;

if she may infact be, ""the one"" (which honestly, we will never know), remember that you have the rest of your foreseeable future (for the moment) to spend with this girl. So don't put all your metaphorical cards in front for her to see. Take it slow and don't tell her every. single. detail. of your life in the span of two weeks (or even two months!!), and above all else, DON'T LET IT BECOME A CO-DEPENDENT RELATIONSHIP! 

Not that you would, but you know, sometimes we as humans let our emotions run wild, and we decide to live vicariously through our new friend instead of through ourselves.

Anyways, good luck and God speed! Sounds like you're off to a great start!"
I can't even get through reading this without being angry; if your date went great and you're happy-that's wonderful. I'm happy for you. Fucking be happy and in love and shit. 
This is similar to how my first ‚Äúdate‚Äù with my husband was. We met at a mutual friends party and decided to meet up the next day both of us were broke and it was late so we drove to the beach (about 45 minutes from the town we lived in) and sat there talking all night. I think I got home around 3am that night. 
My boyfriend and I went and hit dead broken trees with sticks at a lake today. He started teaching me how to throw and jump off of things as well. It was amazing. I am so looking forward to it again. Also we go on ‚Äòfishing‚Äô dates where we go to pet stores and look at the fish they have there.
"We ate barbecue and then walked around the city. Then we bought a tub of ice cream and walked up to the top of a parking garage with a longboard she had in her car. We took turns riding the longboard, but I'd never been on one so I kept falling off. We both had an amazing time, but she had to go off to school a few days later so I never saw her again. "
"That sounds absolutely amazing, I'm so glad you had such a great experience! I love hearing about other people's happy moments. I'm cheering you on!! üëè

As for your question... My boyfriend and I spend every Saturday together, all day, and I think of those as dates. Sometimes we play games, sometimes we go out, sometimes we watch movies. Today we went to the store and bought stuff to make bibimbap, and then we prepared it with some of his family taking part, too. That's pretty unorthodox I imagine, but I enjoy any quality time I get with him.

Going to the store with someone you can really talk to is always a great time, though. :) Running errands becomes a whole new journey!"
"Honestly man, that‚Äôs great to hear! You don‚Äôt hear about people being so in sync on the first date very often. I‚Äôm calling it, give it a few years and the wedding bells are gonna chime."
"I had the same experience just a short while ago. We clicked instantly. We loved spending time just talking. We shared our entire life stories, and by the end of those two days, I felt knew her better than my best friend of fifteen years. Then I had to move, so we cut it off clean so it didn't fizzle and leave us disappointed, because we realized that neither of us were cut out for long distance. We wanted to remember that short time we had with someone really special. 

Do me a favor- enjoy it while you can, my friend, and enjoy every second of it. I speak for all of us who have that one that got away: we envy you so much, but we're really happy for you."
"I met up with a guy who was just traveling through my city for his job (shoutout to Tinder). He was really into fitness and asked for running route recommendations, so I showed him my favorite trails and we talked and ran for about an hour! Definitely unorthodox. We still keep in touch via social media, maybe our paths will cross again someday. "
"On our second date me and my ex planned on getting Thai food and just hanging out afterwards. I stopped by my moms house in the suburbs around 3 pm to pick something up. As I was leaving I see a car slam on the breaks and a woman jump out in front of my neighbors house. Moments later I hear the helicopter nearly overhead and soon after that a cop cruises down the speed at maybe 30mph. The cop and I make eye contact and he circles around and asks if I saw the person exit the vehicle (it was still running) I said I did and gave a description. The sgt. ‚ÄúCash‚Äù then spoke to me and asked me to stick around so I could ID the suspect when they found her. I stupidly said that I had a date and didn‚Äôt think I could. Sgt cash then kinda busted my balls and said he kindof wanted me to help him solve a crime. I asked if I could stop by in two hours. Around 6 or 7 I pick up my date and tell her we have to go back

The whole city block is sealed off and it‚Äôs night by now, as I‚Äôm approaching the blockade, the officers turn me away but I approach and this agitates a female officer who yells at me to turn around. I tell her I need to see sgt cash to ID the suspect, they radio him and let me pass. 

As we‚Äôre waiting on my parents porch we see the swat team roll by. They‚Äôre searching all backyards with K-9 units. My parents dog is barking in the back yard and my dad investigates and finds the girl hiding behind a shed. My dad tells her not to be afraid, nothing will happen to her (me and my date weren‚Äôt aware of this going on) so she follows my dad and has second thoughts and hugs our husky who is very tame. My sister tells her she has to turn herself in. My dad tells a pair of cops on our front porch of what‚Äôs going on and they radio back up. The k-9 shows up and my sister grabs both dogs and brings them out so they won‚Äôt be mailed to death/shot. They bring out the girl without k-9 and I tell sgt. Banks that‚Äôs the girl I saw. She was maybe 24, a heavy set girl. We hang around for a bit and talk to a cool swat officer. 

She told everyone about that experience. I could never live up to that though. It was definitely surreal and almost unbelievable"
"When my now-husband and I were dating, we were big fans of out-of-the-box dates. One of our memorable ones was climbing onto the roof of a strip mall at night and just people-watching from way up high. Looking back, it was a really special point for the two of us. :)"
"This is beautiful! I had a summer romance with a similar vibe and it felt like we had known each other in another life. Everything was so familiar and in depth. I‚Äôm married with children, but still think about him from time to time. It was a beautiful relationship. "
"Meeting my boyfriend (now husband!) for the first time in person. We met online through poetry, dated for 6 months, and made plans to meet each other. He was from Texas, I was in Vermont. We saw each other face-to-face at the baggage claim in the airport, took a taxi back to my dorm. I'd gathered a bunch of Vermont things to give him, and he brought some Texas things for me. After we had our first kiss and....canoodled....we got dressed up all fancy, went and had ice-cream and watched the sun set over Lake Champlain.   


I knew he was the one several times over even before meeting him in person, but that first time together really made it clear to me. "
This is so cute. Marry her lol 
"In high school, a girl and I went to a Starbucks and played scrabble for hours.  I totally forgot about it to be honest until this post so thank you for that!  It was so much fun and I thought it would lead to something but it totally did not unfortunately.  "
"This sounds amazing! 

For myself, when I first met my wife we had talked for a long time on the phone but she lived an hour away from me. So the first time I got a chance to drive out there I called and let her know I was there, this was in 2004 and I was horrible at texting. We both were so shy and awkward that we couldn‚Äôt figure out where to go or what to do. She didn‚Äôt have her license so everywhere we could think of going I didn‚Äôt know how to get there. Finally we found a mall... the smallest mall in the world it seemed. We just talked about what else we should do but she was so shy that she hated eating around people, so dinner was out. She didn‚Äôt want to see a movie because she had school the next day and once we were done at the mall I took her home and walked her to her door. I honestly didn‚Äôt know if she would ever want to see me again. We still talked almost every night. 

I think my saving grace was Valentine‚Äôs Day was only a couple weeks away and on that night I called her like I normally did and told her the conversation was going to be short because I was going to see a good friend. What I was actually doing is driving to her house and bringing her flowers and a small stuffed puppy. When I got there I just gave her a call and said I had made it too my friends as I was walking up. She started to ask me what my friend was like and I just told her to come to the door and find out. She told her grandmother to check the door and her grandmother thought that I was sent by one of her sons with the flowers it took a minute for my wife to come to the door to explain it. I got a hug and a peck on the cheek as my reward. When I got home I had a text saying that was the nicest thing anyone had ever done for her and that was the day I decided that I wanted to make her feel that way every day that I could. 

Sadly there have been more downs than ups and we have been separated for a very long time but I still try to make her feel special. "
"I knew a girl who was into medieval things and I knew there was an old castle ruin in the woods only few people knowing about it.

I took her there and we picnicked in the old courtyard. Talked about everything but sadly it didn't sparked between us. Nevertheless I would say it was one of the bast dates and most romantic things I've done. And as afterthought I'm surprised she went with me there, promising her a surprise in the woods..."
"Awwwww so sweet. Really though, that sounds awesome. Enjoy every moment! See you at the wedding. :)"
"

I went with a girl I was dating [‚Äús‚Äù]  and her friend to watch our schools nordic meet. At least I thought that was it. It turned out s was only going to help go with her friend cheer on her friend‚Äôs crush. So I was also there to set up her friend. It was very weird"
"I'm so happy for you!

This is kind of how the girl I'm currently talking to and I got together! We just went out late one night, spontaneously, for milkshakes. We drove around and found a quiet spot to sit outside and enjoy the night sky. It was really relaxing. "
"My husband and I saw a movie, went to dinner, walked around his university campus, and walked around a Walmart on our first date! I liked going to a store with him. It was a good way to get to know each other, really. We also met on tinder :) Happy for you!"
"I don't know if it would really be considered a date, but we were at a party in college, I always had a crush on him and I guess he had a thing for me to some degree (we had already known each other for about a year). The party was dying down but we were both heavily intoxicated, so we went and sat on the fishing pier and talked about fish and scuba diving and all sorts of things that we had mutual interest in. He was rubbing my back because apparently it felt very nice and I was just soaking up every moment because I finally got to spend time alone with this kid. I think we sat there until about 5 am. "
"wow that sounds like one hell of an amazing date, really happy for you. i hope that you and her end up being perfectly compatible. i hope one day soon i can meet someone and just go on a few goofy dates like that. thanks for posting to assure that stuff like that really does happen. have fun on date #2!"
I once got bubble tea with a girl and then we walked across the street to a consignment store and just browsed for about two hours. Similar to your story of just laughing at all the things we saw. So much fun
"I've had first dates like that on tinder and everything goes so extremely well and we both are just having a great time and then they disappear after a couple dates. No reason why, just stop talking to me and it feels bad. I hope the best for you though "
"We went to a casino, he taught me about various bits of gambling, we won loads of money. On the way home he took me to a Krispy Kreme drive thru and bought me a huge box of donuts.

Sadly there was no second date as despite all of this I just didn't fancy him :-("
"IKEA. We went into an IKEA with the mission to find the comfiest couch. And just say and talked and chilled. Very nice, quiet and different. 
After the date we got the 99c ice cream as a nice ending. 
10/10 would love to do again "
"The first time I met my boyfriend was interesting. He flew in from the West Coast to Toronto to see me and I was supposed to pick him up and we were driving to Montreal the next day. I ended up at the wrong terminal and I was frantically texting and calling him while simultaneously trying to take the monorail between terminals. It was made worse because he had told me before that he really hated when people weren't at the right place at the right time and I just thought I was mucking it up from the start. 

Anyway I picked him up, got some wine and we head back to my place and we are watching a movie. Its dark out and the lights are off and as I'm trying to get out of the bed I manage to hit the night table with the wine glasses and break one of the glasses while hitting my head. So, first night, pretty eventful. 

The next day in Montreal we were walking at night to find some souvenirs and food and at one of the shops my boyfriend is looking for a license plate (he collects them) and as he's bend over looking at a shelf, a man comes over and strokes his back. I'm standing in a corner of the shop just watching and laughing because this is literally a random man. My boyfriend looks up and the man goes ""oh sorry I thought you were my wife"". It was so weird and awkward. Later we head into a restaurant and the server tells us the kitchen is closed and if it weren't an awkward night already my boyfriend extends out his hand (the server has his hands full with dishes and whatnot) and says something like ""ok well thanks man."" Even he was confused by his actions in hindsight. The next morning I woke him up because I snorted.

At least I got most of the embarrassing stuff after the first week. 

It was also an interesting time when he was supposed to meet my parents (they live in a kind of rural place and it snows a lot there). Its freezing cold and my car breaks down in the middle of the road and luckily I'm close enough to their house that they can pick us up. And that's how my parents met my boyfriend... On a cold winter day... On the road in the middle of nowhere... While my car's engine was smoking. Fun times. We spent most of that vacation in and out of mechanic stores and stuck on the road with or without my parents. 

Fun times."
"My best first date was shortly after a 2-year relationship ended, my friends encouraged me to join Tinder, matched with this guy and started chatting.

He lived a city over from me (about an hour away), it was Halloween weekend, he was going to come to my city, meet for a few drinks and that would be it.

The day of our date he messaged that his friends surprised him by arranging a Halloween party and had bought him a costume, he asked if we could meet earlier so he could be back in time, and also invited me to join them, I passed on going to another city with a complete stranger, but was happy to go for drinks.

As soon as he sat down I knew he was a great guy, he just had a lovely vibe, so after chatting and having our first drink I said I'd go to the party, went to my place quickly, got into a costume and off we went.

Dressing up and Halloween are my favourite things so I had a blast chatting to different people, seeing their costumes and of course hanging out with this guy."
"I had this coupon for two can dine for 9.99 at. Mcdonalds, I jokingly asked this girl at work if she wanted to go on a ghetto date, surprisingly she said yes so now I was fucked. Anyway I wanted to make it ultra ghetto and told her to meet me at the bus stop near her house, was waiting for her on the bus when she got on, bussed it to the downtown core, wandered around and picked up takeout mcdonalds, told her I had enough money for one large big gulp and then pulled out a mickey or rum and poured that in, sat on a park bench got a slight buzz eating mcdonalds. She was cool.

"
This put a smile on my face; thank you. 
I'm happy for you op !
I love it when people hit it off like that. 
"Similar to you, me and a girl went for fries, then set out on an epic adventure to find a cutting board. I think we tried almost ten stores before we found one we liked, which I then bought for her as a late birthday gift. It was strange but it was very fun just chatting and meandering through the city. "
This just made me so sad. My girlfriend and I used to do this exact thing. I found out she cheated on me yesterday and everything in my life has just fallen apart. I hope you two can find some happiness.
Best date I‚Äôve been on was when this girl and I went to sonic and got slushees and then went back to my dorm and built a Star Wars lego together while watching the office and talking about life 
When‚Äôs the wedding? (Not being rude that sounds like a first date for a true couple).
"I had a girl describe her dream date as ‚Äúgoing to dinner and then to IKEA and testing all the wardrobes to see if they‚Äôre a portal to Narnia.‚Äù

So we did exactly that. Basically just wandered around and acted goofy, it was fun! "
Aww that‚Äôs so cute. This post made me really happy. Thank you OP! I‚Äôm happy for you too!
"I had just fixed the outboard engine on my tender and took it out for a little spin. It was a lovely sunny day and I was just floating around in the sea getting a tan. Then this girl I‚Äôve been crushing on texts me. I‚Äôm not even sure where she got my number but she was on the beach and asked what I was up to. 

Well I was about 5 minutes away so I fired up the motor and sped round to the beach. I had never been to this side of the beach before and there were rocks in the shallow water. I hit the propeller on a rock and the shear pin did its job and sheared right off. So now I had no drive but luckily I was at the beach. 

We spent a couple of hours together just chilling and drinking some warm cider I brought with me for my little excursion. Then she said she wanted to come back to the boat on the little tender with me. It would only have been a 10 minute journey but the engine had no torque at all. The propeller span but when you revved the engine it didn‚Äôt go anywhere. I explained that to her and that it will probably take a long ass time to get home without the engine. I only had 1 oar which I hadn‚Äôt realised when I set off. 

She was cool with that but we soon got out in the water and realised we were literally just treading water. We were going against the tide and it was pretty damn embarrassing on my part. We weren‚Äôt in any danger really but it would‚Äôve taken an hour or two to get home. 

So she offered to tow us home. By that I mean I tied a rope around her ankle and she started swimming back. While I drank cider, laughed and pretended to fix the engine. It was quite a funny situation and she was all for it. I offered to swim but she is a strong independent woman and all...

As we were making very slow progress a guy that was fishing up on the marina wall shouted over to us ‚ÄúWE PHONED THE COASTGUARD!‚Äù. I was like damn thanks for that but we don‚Äôt need rescuing by the coastguard. A few minutes later a small fishing boat was coming past and I waved him down and he towed us into the marina. 

As we enter the marina we went past the RNLI launch berth and they were all suiting up and getting ready to come save our ass. I waved them over and explained that someone thought we were in distress and it‚Äôs cool now because we are back in the marina. They then towed us right back to my berth because they‚Äôd already launched the boat. They were very cool about it and gave me the standard lecture about safety at sea. 

Then about 10 minutes after they‚Äôd gone and we were sitting on the pontoon 3 people from the coastguard turned up to lecture us again. I had only taken 1 lifejacket with me because I wasn‚Äôt expecting to pick up a passenger and they weren‚Äôt happy about that. They came on board my boat and wanted to see all the flares and smoke flares etc to check they were in date. They really weren‚Äôt happy that they‚Äôd been called out for nothing, I wasn‚Äôt happy about it either but what can you do really?

Anyways that is what I refer to as our first date. We spent the day together at least. "
"Mine was when I was on holidays in the US (I'm an Aussie) I met and just clicked with the bouncer at a bar in New Orleans. We ended up spending like a week together while I was there, as you do. The first ""date"" we went on was just wandering up and down Bourbon St, eating pizza, getting to know everything about each other - we even went to a strip club at one point but we didn't even watch the dancers and just kept talking so we ended up leaving anyway. He picked me up at my hotel at like midnight and we finished the date at about 5am when he walked me back, kissed me and went home, perfect gentleman considering all the seedy elements of the date haha! "
"My now ex girlfriend and I used to be a couple very horny teenagers so we used to go in search of random make out spots in our town where we could get a little privacy. This became a sort of a routine after a while, and i‚Äôm not gonna say these dates were boring but it was getting kind of monotonous. So one day, we were up on the roof of a friend‚Äôs apartment, and it was supposed to be a normal make out date but for some reason we started looking at memes on Reddit and idk how but we sat there for hours laughing and talking about the internet‚Äôs ridiculous sense of humour. It was kinda beautiful tbh. At the end of the day, she told me it was the happiest she‚Äôd ever been with anybody in her life, and I couldn‚Äôt stop grinning like an idiot. She cheated on me about six months later but it was probably the cutest date i‚Äôve been on. :)"
"It was new years and we wanted to go watch the fireworks, but it was our third date and too late to plan anything. And really cold.  So we stayed at home and drank and watched youtube videos of fireworks piped through my speaker system instead. "
"when my girlfriend and i first started dating, we took the metro into D.C. from the outer suburbs to check out a museum. the museum was, of course, closed for the day, but at that point we were already there, and it was extremely hot out, and she kept mentioning how all she wanted was a big slice of watermelon. so we decided to walk two miles to a safeway, buy an entire watermelon (it was a lot cheaper than buying pre-cut), and sat on the curb cutting it open with plastic utensils we grabbed from the deli. ate the whole thing sitting on the sidewalk, i bought her some cheap flowers while she was in the bathroom cleaning the watermelon juice off her face, and she fell asleep on my shoulder on the metro on the way back home. we've been together for like two years now and it was one of a first times i realized i was totally in love with her. "
"When my bf and I went on our first date, the whole town  was covered in ice. Like, the streets were slippery as hell and it was cold as hell. We took a walk in the park at night and it was magical. We talked, we flirted. After that we had a drink at a caf√© and I remember hearing him laugh and I was like.. wow.

We've been together for almost 2,5 years now. :)"
"The way you know you've found somebody special is that you can enjoy the day to day things just as much as the ""dates"". Like going round shopping, getting groceries, making food together can be just as special as going for a planned meal or a movie."
Did u hit it?
"I love this thread. I've never been a fan of the conventional date formats, and this gives me ideas for out of the box dates. Thanks, OP."
Girl I was dating took me to the Monterey Aquarium - we slept overnight under the huge bazillion gallon tank with all kinds of cool sea life in it. It was awesome. 
"I have to say, those kind of unorthodox dates are the best ones in my opinion when you are looking for a serious relationship. I know that the strongest relationships happen when people can be themselves with their significant other. If you can hit this step right away, it can be a sign that you have found someone who is right for you. Not necessarily as a lover, but even as a friend. Being able to act natural is one of the best feelings, because trying to act different to seduce someone will only lead to problems when you forget to hide your true personality. Which you shouldnt have to anyway."
"My girlfriend (now wife) thought our first date was amazing (it wasn‚Äôt...I never called her back) so she summoned the courage to call me and arrange another. I say ok. She takes me to the zoo (yay) but otherwise not too special. Turns out she had worked there for 10 years before her current job and had a special hookup...we went ‚Äúbehind the scenes‚Äù and I got to feed the rhinos their lunch and pet them and stuff...same with giraffes. As I said, now my wife :)"
"I met a girl last week and we went on a first date on Wednesday. Just a casual pint - nothing special. We realised England were playing Croatia and got into the match. 

At half time we were sitting outside the bar having a cigarette when her mother happened to be walking by. Her mother joined us and we spent the next 5 hours having drinks and laughing together with other random people joining our conversation as the night rolled on.

 It was such a strange first date but the night ended with a fantastic kiss and will be seeing her again tomorrow - I haven't felt this excited to be seeing someone again in such a long time"
"Sounds great! Your story reminded me of Before Sunrise, which is one of my favorite movies. Hope things work out between you two (and apparently they already are)."
"She had never seen Bob Ross, but is a very creative person. I asked her to bring over whatever art supplies she had laying around and we would follow along with the show.


We have two very decent depictions of a warm winter landscape with a cabin... drawn in crayon on Charcoal paper.


She is now a huge fan of Bob Ross and we both had a great time"
We went to a mutual friend's son's birthday party at a place like Chuck-E-Cheese. We placed lots of games and during SkeeBall I looked over and had the strangest sensation. Like I had just met my best friend. We will celebrate 20 years together next February. üíï
"My first date with my husband went similarly. We met up at Starbucks for coffee in the afternoon. After talking for hours we went to a restaurant for dinner, then to a bookstore. When the bookstore closed, nothing else was open in town besides bars, Walmart and a 24-hour convenience store that had a couple of tables inside. We went to the convenience store and talked even more, until 4am. Many of our later dates ended up at that convenience store, talking until way too late. The overnight clerk was really happy when we told her we were going to get married."
"Night hike. We met on Tinder but not in person. I brought my bear spray though and we're still together so it worked out. I tell everyone concerned for my safety that if I had died it would have been in pursuit of adventure. But seriously, not even the most dangerous date I've been on with a stranger.

Also, whitewater kayaking (when I'd never been kayaking before), and rock climbing and camping at the Alabama Hills (when I'd never lead belayed before). I guess I've got a dangerous streak. "
"To be honest I don‚Äôt even remember where we started our date, but we ended walking around town, and we passed by a country club/casino, there was a wedding and we just went in, sat at the table close to the entrance a waiter came and asked if we wanted to get drinks we ordered some, and then we just walked out. Have to add that we were wearing very casual clothes. It was just so funny."
"Congratulations man! Looks like your found the right person to have in your life, I'm happy for you!

My best date started with a hockey game. Getting really pumped up and excited as well as having something to talk about made the rest of the evening really fun and relaxed."
"Woke her up, told her we were gonna go apple picking at an orchard. 

Ended up raining as we were ready to leave and she started singing and dancing so I joined in. 

Ended up being one of those dates that let me know so much of who she was without saying a word.

My first date with my wife was slightly similar to yours as far as the talking and hours goes. Started at 6 ended at 4:45 am. When you connect and people open up and you both are enjoying each others company and laughing and getting to know pne another and sharing it can feel like an immense high that carries over until you see them next.

The type of happiness that infects your soul so much that people can't help but notice a difference."
Hope this is the beginning of a irl love story. Can't wait for the sequel! Got to keep us all updated now.
When I read this I felt excited to go on a date and experience those same feeling same feeling all over again. Then I remembered that I can‚Äôt because I‚Äôm already in a relationship. Then I went back to happy again because I remembered that me and my SO are always in sync like this! Except when we fight and we had a small fight yesterday so I kinda forgot lol.
"Was on holiday,Swimming in a pool,and some girl was watching,So me and my dad that was with me invited her to come swim,It ended up being like 3 full days of just going out with eachother,Took 1 day off when i went back to our original place we were on holiday for,Found out the original place was much colder,So we ended up going back and i called her up again,And we spend that day together too... Until i got into a fight with my dad and never seen her in real life  again.. Ended up doing a long distance thing with her for 2 months and then she decided to just block me for some stupid reason,While she was the one doing all the bad shit like hiding a child from me..."
"Met a girl a a friends birthday party, started texting.

Picked her up from her work after uni, to play pool and have a drink 5pm, at 7 we go for food, 9 we go see fireworks (5th November) drop her home at 1am. Longest first date I've ever had, we've been together 11 years. "
"I managed to accidentally take home a friend of a friend‚Äôs jacket - in the process of giving it back to him, we spent five hours together just wandering round to different cafes and talking about our lives. Definitely one of my least expected dates."
"My husband and I went on our first date to the science museum, OMSI, here in Portland. We had both just moved to Portland and hadn‚Äôt been there yet. We met on an online dating site, so we figured it would be a fun getting to know you spot without all the pressure of staring at each other over a meal or sitting silently in the movies. 

After the museum, we decided to go for dinner and then drinks and then sat in his car listening to music for hours. Ended up being a 12 hour first date. ;)"
"This is an awesome date, I'm so glad you guys had so much fun! It sounds like you really clicked with someone :) Me and my boyfriend go geocaching all the time which I think is a pretty cool date thing, even though it sounds a bit weird. You're busy but not THAT busy, so we still get to talk and etc."
"August 1, last year. 

My now boyfriend and I had met on a dating app and I finally gave in and had agreed to have coffee. Both of us were using the meet-up as a way to get our friends off our backs. However... I basically never left his side for more than about 3 days at a time since. That first day? Spent 18 confusingly wonderful hours together. A nap here, a weird story there, etc. It wasn‚Äôt love at first sight I‚Äôll admit, but every day after that I realized he‚Äôs the only love I‚Äôll ever want to have in my sights for as long as I live. "
Make it count man :)
"The first date wirh my bf (and the first date I have ever went on) we went to a death metal concert. The band we saw was a danish band, and it was a really small concert (there were like 30 people). It was really fun and for some reason the lead singer of the warm up band knew my bfs name. After we sat outside under some red and green lights and talked and made jokes. Even though it was a kind of weird date idea, I still really enjoyed it"

"
Sounds lovely! This makes me feel very happy :)"
I took a date to a random hindu temple in the area.  Neither one of us was hindu. 
Nothing beats those early times of a race when you realize how much you've clicked and bonded and liking forward all day to seeing or talking over the phone with that special someone. 
"I have a girlfriend who likes science, and I'm a scientist myself, so I take her to science places. Once we went to a salt mine, as far as I know, they are not that common through the earth, but if you live near one, and you have a bit of confidence with your date, don't miss the chance. We also went to a science museum, played with science children toys and went to a botanical garden. Once I sneaked her into my lab
"
"Set up on a ""blind date"" by a friend. The guy had just moved here from out of state and didn't know very many people.  We went to a Fleetwood Mac concert and bought tickets from a scalper who was standing on the ramp into the parking lot.  I would love to do more stuff like that ! "
Awww sounds like you guys had fun! I dont know you but for some reason I am really happy for you. Hope everything goes well with you and your new lady friend OP!
"This guy I liked who I worked with for only a month agreed to hang out with me on the night of Christmas. I met up with him in the parking lot of a small shopping center. Everything was closed and really quiet in the city. I hopped in his SUV and a thought did cross my mind ‚Äúthis is how people go missing,‚Äù but I had a good feeling about him overall. 
He ended up driving me all over town and showed me his high school and house he grew up in, meanwhile playing songs for me that he really liked - including a couple songs he wrote.
We have been together for 4.5 years and I just got back from spending a week with him and his family at the beach. I‚Äôm glad I did a stupid thing and hopped into this pretty much stranger‚Äôs car on Christmas night. "
"My boyfriend and I frequently go to the stores late at night just to kill time. But we have some of the best inside jokes because of it. We also like going on adventures- just driving around, maybe hitting up 5 fast food spots in a hour, and just having a good time. "
"Buddy, I think you just fell a little bit in love."
"Congratulations dude! Sounds like you had an absolutely wonderful experience! I hope everything goes well for you on the second date and that your relationship lasts a long time! I'm happy for you!

I wish I could tell you a story but I've never been on a date. The last time (which was also the first time) I've mustered up enough courage to ask out a girl on a date I got a rejection in response."
"Well,we met on tinder and our first conversation was about the puppy bowl. Our first date was just walking around the mall,talking. It was such a teenager date(despite us being well into our twenties)but it was fun. Ate some subway,watched a movie,then people watched. 

"
"kinda similar to how my first ""date"" went with my boyfriend :)"
Climbing onto the on the roof of a playhouse on campus and sitting up there until four am just shooting the shit and laughing at the drunk frat bros in the quad. 
"He took me to Bingo on one of our first dates. It was hilarious and fun and different. I had never been before, he had gone with his grandmother before (and he had brought a few other girls in the past). We‚Äôve been together for 6+ years now and are expecting our first child. "
Congratulations! I gotta say that‚Äôs a great experience. You never know how it‚Äôll go meeting pretty much a stranger. 
"I guess is not a proper date, but an ex of mine is now one of my best friends. We try and have a get together as much as we can. One of the latests, we went and played about 5 games of billiards and ate hot wings. Drove her home and she realized she forgot her apartment keys, I have some tools on the trunk, think I can manage a door lock. We vault the first gate and the reception door is luckily open. Of course I can't manage to open her door and some neighbor locked The reception door behind us. We get stuck on her hallway for about 4 hours, Just talking about everhthing we've misses the past couple of years, laughing our asses off at this incredibly bad idea. Finally, at 3 am another neighbor parks his car in the basement parking and after swearing we were Just dumb and not robbers manage to get out. Feels so damn good we drive down town, windows rolled down, she's taking in all The streets that are normally a grid lock. End up crashing at my mom's house and making hotcackes for breakfast. "
"When I met my fianc√© it was through a mutual friend, so I don‚Äôt really consider that more than our first meeting, not date. However, the next day I messaged him on Facebook and said I‚Äôd be down to clown anytime. I really felt something strong when I met him, and I knew I had to see him again. He messaged me back asking if I wanted to just go over to his house that day. I was like YES. I showed up and we sat in his room talking for a long time. Then I figured it was getting late so we went out to my car and whoops, talked for even more hours. For the first time in my life I felt like here was a person who didn‚Äôt drain me in any way, who actually gave me life when I was around him. It felt wonderful. I didn‚Äôt want to leave. About 6 months later I moved in with him and have been here ever since.

We‚Äôre getting married in October. :)"
"My wife and I, before we were married, went on a dinner and a show date. But before dinner, we had a wedding. A dog wedding. We stopped by a vet in town who had signs for a dog wedding. Neither of us knew the dogs, nor anyone else there. We dressed in full formal attire. We stuck out among the soccer moms and kids wearing regular tshirts.

We then grabbed an average dinner. But the show we went to after was a high school play. Neither of us knew anyone at the high school (neither of us had been there before). There were maybe twenty people in the audience and we went to congratulate the actors afterwards.

It was the fact that we had so much fun doing it all in one night that told me she was definitely the one."
An all night play through of Silent Hill 2.
"I like to say my husband and I dated through the mail. We met at on an airplane and exchanged email addresses after the flight. We emailed for awhile, then switched to hand writing letters to one another. The letters got more and more creative and elaborate and turned into packages. I painted him a self portrait, he send me a copy of his favorite album, we experimented with origami type letter folding. He painted me a still life with his violin and had wedged a piece of folded paperboard in the back of the canvas. I was convinced he did this because he wanted it viewed at a certain angle. I just couldn‚Äôt figure out where to display it, and after a few days removed the homemade backing to find a tissue paper rose he had made for me. We talked on the phone too, but the letters were very special for both of us. 

After months of writing and calling, we finally agreed to have a date in person (we lived 2.5 hours apart). I bought a large roll on canvas, I don‚Äôt know if it was gesso‚Äôed or not now, and we painted each others bodies with acrylic paints and printed them on the canvas. The results weren‚Äôt great, but it was fun once we got over the cold paint on our skin. "
That‚Äôs called falling in love. Gratz!
"Had a friend who was online dating and he‚Äôs a big rock climbing, hiking, biking, running, swimming stud.  He‚Äôs see all these profiles where girls would be like ‚ÄúI love the outdoors‚Äù and have their arms outstretched as they were next to some mountain or trail in Colorado or some other shit.  You know the type, usually just potheads who go for a hike once a year and want their Instagram to look cool.  So he would invite them on a date for a hike and most times none of the girls could keep up.  If they could, they‚Äôd get a second date.  He finally married one of them."
"That‚Äôs pretty much ALL my wife and I did when we were dating! Wandered around Walmart late at night, Toys R Us (RIP), drove around, etc. We joke that we never really had a proper ‚Äúdate‚Äù and maybe we should do that someday but we‚Äôve been married 19 years now so we must have done something right!"
wow i'm jelous
"So I was in my mid 20's, essentially homeless and couch surfing between my mom's house for laundry and my friends house for college.  I'm living out of a backpack and my car.  Was working for a dating site startup as a software engineer so decided to do market research and see what's up.  My 2nd OKCupid date is this cute little nerdy girl...which is totally my thing.  She doesn't have a car.  

First date she takes a bus to the mall, I pick her up and drive her an hour and 45 minutes back to my moms house (no one is ever home during the day).

I get there and she's way cuter than her photos.  Score!  We go to a store and pickup drinks on the way at a place that I knew would card both of us (wanted to make sure she was definitely over 21)...She was.  Sweet!

We get back to my moms place and chill in my bedroom.  We're making idle chit-chat, normal awkward early first date stuff.  I'm sitting on the opposite side of the room at my computer to make sure she feels comfortable given the fact she's like 40 miles from where I picked her up at with a complete stranger.  I'm casually pulling up funny videos and stuff to fill the silence.  We're having some drinks.  Somehow we got on the topic of lichens and I brought up how I had recently read a news article about how lichens can survive in space and how cool I thought that was...She goes nuts over this, apparently she minored in biology and has a weird fascination with fungi.  I end up pulling up the article so she can read it.

After that we were basically nerd best friends.  She definitely had that shy nerdy vibe but me...I give off more of a stoner / partier kinda vibe so I think it threw her through a loop that I was capable of carrying a conversation about super nerdy things.  The conversation immediately went from idle chit chat with awkward silences to talking about deep shit like we've known each other for years...just really fluid, natural conversation.

Eventually we decide to watch a movie.  I pull up my massive harddrive full of movies and we start trying to find a movie.  Because I'm a nerd I have literally every Disney movie from my childhood on there.  We end up settling on The Lion King.  Now I'm an emotional wall when it comes to watching movies so I didn't realize the fuck-up I had just walked into.  

I go over and join her on my bed.  Still keeping a distance because she has no way out of chilling with me at this point since we had both been drinking.  We're watching it...She starts getting cuddly with me.  Then starts getting handsy.  Fuck yes, this is going good.  Then it happens.  Fucking Mufasa dies...This girl is in tears.  I'm comforting her the best  know how to...hugging her, but still super awkward.

Eventually it passes....the movie ends.  We're smiling, talking, and cuddling.  Recovered!

Eventually it's getting late and I pull out the move that I now use on every first date I can manage to work it into.  I offered her a massage.  Shirt comes off.  I tell her I'll look away if she wants to unstrap her bra...She hesitates but does.  I proceed to give her a very long completely innocent massage until she is just a relaxed mess underneath me.  Then I start getting fresh, doing her sides and glancing her sideboob, she's digging it...I'll spare the details but we ended up having very hot, passionate sex multiple times.

We ended up dating each other for 3.5 years.  We lived together for a while.  She introduced me to eurogames, we went on vacations together (which may not sound special to you, but I grew up dirt poor and her family was loaded...I had never been on a vacation before), we had our first threesomes together, we both got career jobs around the same time.  

Sadly, it was not meant to be, but we both did a lot of growing up in those years and there are parts of me that are a direct result of that relationship.  Hell, I just introduced my neighbor and her family to Settlers of Catan 2 weeks ago."
"The restaurant we were going to closed due to lightning. So we ended up taking our food to go, eating it back at my house and watching Black Mirror. After we finished we just sat there and trying to come up with something to do with it storming outside. There's a large hill with walking trails that overlooks the city and I asked if she had ever been, she had not. We drove through the rain and by the time we got there it had stopped raining but there was still a lot of lightning. We set up a bed sheet I had in my trunk and we just sat there watching the lightning and talking until almost 3 am. We kissed for the first time that night. 

Hands down the most romantic thing I've ever done."
Me and this girl I was totally crazy about broke into a cemetery after dark. I went there almost everyday while it was open because it was peaceful and beautiful. I learned all the haunted stories of the place over the years and so I invited her out there we jumped the fence and I took her to all the haunted crypt and graves and told her the stories. At the end we had to run out because a cop was doing rounds and saw us. It was such a successful date. 
"Brought my girlfriend over to my house where we bushwhacked through blackberries and followed the occasional game trail through a very very wild ravine leading from my backyard to a different neighborhood. We got very scratched up and bloody, but it was very fun. We came back home and watched two Ghibli movies (Mononoke and nausicaa) while cuddling."
"I got very sick the day before I was to take a nice girl out for dinner.  We went to a very nice restaurant, and I pretended to enjoy the food even though I couldn't really taste it.  Not feeling well and remembering that my mother asked me to stop by and pick something up, I proceeded to take my first date to my mom's house nearby (as I am not on that end of town often).  After hanging out there, I decided to stop by my sister's work (been awhile since I saw her, again not on that end of town much).  After visiting with my sister at her work she then tells me that her mom is at the nearby walmart doing her shopping and we then head over there.  At this point I'm feeling like I should be in the cart being pushed around with how sick I was feeling (she started asking how I was doing, as it was obvious that I was going downhill).  After her mom is finished shopping, we head out to the parking lot where it's getting late and we should head our separate ways.  We talk for about half an hour, and go our separate ways.  I call her when I get home to apologize for the (what I thought) was an awful date and we end up talking until 1am.  7 months later we married.  It's 15 years this year :)"
My first ‚Äúdate‚Äù with my now husband (from Tinder) was on spent on the telephone before our actual in person first date.  He called me and we watched Airplane! in sync and each made popcorn and stayed on the phone the entire time the movie was playing. Then after it was over we talked for a couple of hours before finally hanging up. Very fun idea to see if you have chemistry before actually meeting someone.  
"Took a girl to a art museum and we spent hours taking turns coming up with backs stories for the people in the paintings, it was a great first date."
The best things in life are free and simple.
"See, this is the kind of story I need to convince my parents that Tinder is a good thing"
That sounds great.  I hope it works out.  Most of my dates conclude with me deciding that I really hate the person and feeling like I can't wait to get away. 
"i had one that wasn‚Äôt really a date.  the lady who is now my wife couldn‚Äôt come with me to a dueling pianos thing in philly so i asked some other lady to go with me.  she ended up being late, so combined with 95 traffic, we missed the dueling pianos.   she was (and still is) austrian, so i asked her if she had ever been to delaware.   she hadn‚Äôt, so we kept driving.   we found a high school football game, which she also had never seen.  we watched for a bit, maybe ate some junk that she had also never eaten and then drove back home.   it was nice.   "
"Thrift shopping! Back when I was dating, thrift shopping was great at breaking tension. There are always weird WTF items to laugh over. I‚Äôm still kicking myself for not buying that framed homemade pastel N‚ÄôSync drawing. "
"I was getting my masters and money was tight. Told my husband I wanted to go on a date, but it needed to be pretty much free. He took me to the park and produced a stack of copy paper. Proceeded to challenge me to a paper airplane building competition. Best date ever, would marry him again."
"My first date with my now partner, I got the train to his town and we just walked around for a while. Walked to the beach, then along the cliff edge and found this shipwreck. We couldn't get to the shipwreck as the tide was in. He told me that meant I'd have to come back next weekend so we could check it out together (smooth). I did."
"I went to get fast food with this girl a year or two ago, she brought two of her friends without telling me and didn't go to the place we agreed to go since she was driving, she made the whole, ""date"" about herself and we ended up barely talking, it was awkward. The thing is she asked me out and I said yes, which I regreted after the date. I guess I could describe it as unorthodox, but really it was just plain bad."
"I love motorcycles, he loves motorcycles

First date/ meeting  was at the racetrack near us and I got to watch him and everyone else race their bikes on the track!!

SO. MUCH. FUN. üéâ"
"I matched with a girl on tinder about 6 months ago that I realized I had met before. She was the first tinder date I had ever gone on 2 years earlier, and the date was super awkward. Naturally I asked her on a second date, and she said yes.

We went to a comedy/circus-y variety show, went to a 24 hour diner, and then I took her back to my place at 3 am. We just sat and talked for a couple more hours before falling asleep. It was a good second date 2 years after the first."
"Didn't start out as a date.  I needed to go to the outlet mall about an hour away for some socks and he offered to join me.  Had no idea why, but was happy to have company since it was a huge outdoor mall.  After a few hours of window shopping, sock buying, and stupid jokes, I didn't even notice we had been holding hands.  

"
After not seeing my bf for a week last night I met up with him and his friends at a brewery after a baseball game. I sober cabbed them back to the train station where there cars are parked. After my bf and I went to the local TGI Fridays for a cocktail. I was upset with him that he opted out of my family's mini vacation 10 hours before we were supposed to leave. We kissed and made up then the next thing you know we drive to the nearest church parking lot and had the best sex ever in the back of his car. Then went to dinner and got home and had another mind blowing session. And now hes snoring in my ear. 
Walked through an Ikea once. Even had lunch there.
"OP, sounds like you‚Äôve got a keeper there! Met my wife on Tinder :)"
Good for you OP! 
"All of the dates my girlfriend and I have been on thus far have been pretty generic, (dinner and a walk in the park, art museum, picnic, etc.). Yesterday, I would say was the first one that wasn‚Äôt as normal as the rest. We went out for breakfast at a local place, and we live near a very touristy town, so we decided to play tourist for the day and just walk around town. We looked at the shops, talked, laughed, made fun of all the tacky stuff you could buy, and had a really great time. She gave me a tour of a store she used to work at, and we ended it with snow cones. Honestly, it was one of the least planned, but most enjoyable dates we‚Äôve had yet."
"I think movies are terrible first dates even second dates. Then entire time you can‚Äôt talk, can‚Äôt connect and just waste that time staring at a screen. See a movie on like the 4th or 5th date or just cuddle and Netflix, which to me seems even better than being at a movie theater. Plus then you can see their Netflix choices and decide if they r compatible or not."
"When I met my boyfriend on tinder we decided to go to the local zoo to meet for the first time. 
From a practicality standpoint it was a mid point between where we both live, it was neutral ground that we both knew, it was somewhere we both liked going and we both love animals! 

It was however the middle of December so we froze our tits off but it was really fun! 
We walked around all day and while it was slightly awkward to begin with, by the end we were both really comfortable together! 
It's something we'll always remember as it wasn't the typical drinks or dinner type situation which can get a little awkward if things end up going south! 
I'd highly recommend something similar but my only advice would be, choose a day that isn't absolutely freezing! "
"The most unorthodox date I was on was a  first date at her apartment. 

I didn't want to go to her apartment on a first date, but hey, we were gonna play smash and bake pizza. 

Date was actually really fun but her pictures were apparently really old. She only had a small resemblance to her photos."
I haven‚Äôt been on a date I. 2 years and fell in love with my best female friend who currently has a gf. I‚Äôm fucked 
"For Me and my boyfriends first ‚Äúreal‚Äù date we went to ihop in pajamas, then good will and target. It was fun "
"My time to shine, even if this is 17hrs old. 

My first real date, with my current partner of a decade, was supposed to be a burlesque show. He picked me up in his primer grey, slammed mk2 VW, with no interior. We first went to his friends apartment to rally the rest of the group going. We were to caravan into the city. We got less than a mile out and his car started to overheat. 

We pull over and sure enough, that radiator was bone dry. We look under the car, dont see anything hanging down. No pulled out hoses.

 Its 9pm, were in an industrial area and the closest place selling gallons of water is three quarters of a mile. He calls for AAA or whatever to tow it home. We walk on to the grocery store, get four gallons, two each and walk back. Its now 945ish, we pour water in, hear water pouring out. He finds the loose hose, that his lowered car caught in his friends apartments parking lot, on the speed bump. Reattach that hose just as the tow truck pulls in. 

Didnt make it to the show, but I sure can hang. Haha

He owned that fast POS for many years. Haha"
My best date was sat on bed a bed for two hours just talking in Ikea. (Ikea is flat pack/funture store) 
"Last man I dated, our first date was us and our sons (we each have one, about four years apart). The four of us went to dinner at Bob's Big Boy, which I had suggested because my son and I liked to walk around the car show in the parking lot on Friday nights. I figured that would give us enough time to feel each other out, say good night, and decide whether or not to go out again. We ended up doing that, and then went to a local place sort of like Chuck E Cheese so the boys could play, because we weren't done spending time together. We closed the place down, far past both boys' bed times. We just really enjoyed each other, and really connected, so we didn't care what we were doing but just wanted to be with each other. We had our first kidless date the next week, a standard nice dinner out, and later fell in love and had a terrible relationship overall. But there was a very strong connection between us from that first date, and it is my go-to ""best date"" example."
"My boyfriend (now fianc√©) and I went to Colorado, got quite stoned, ate at Five Guys because there isn‚Äôt one within hundreds of miles of where we live. We ended up eating so many of their peanuts we were too full for the food we ordered. 
Then, we agreed on saving our money on getting a hotel and just set up a hammock in-between some trees at a Walmart somewhere and slept in it. It‚Äôs one of our favorite memories!"
We couldn't make our mind up as to what to do & got starbucks. We sat in parking lot that also had a liquor store & a few other stores in a strip mall & guessed peoples names based on what they looked like. It devolved into saying truly horrible things about strangers to entertain ourselves. We found out that we share twisted senses of humor. We're still together & crazy in love.
"I asked a girl out in middle school, I was taking her to the movies! I rode my bike to the theatre to see her and she wasn‚Äôt there :P I waited like 2 hours haha then her sister showed up riding her bike to the movie theatre. She let me know that her sister stood me up and she was sorry. So I asked her if she wanted to watch a movie and we did! We dated for 3 years! It was a great relationship too "
"Met up with a guy I‚Äôd been talking to pretty spontaneously as we‚Äôd both mentioned we were free that night. I didn‚Äôt really know what to do, so at first we watched a movie at my place, but then neither of us wanted to leave. So we went to a 24 hour donut place on campus (we‚Äôre both in college) and watched all the drunk people get their hangover food. Then we walked by the bars and danced in the street to their shitty trap music. We walked for probably about an hour just people watching and talking. And then we went back to my place and watched the curling gold medal match (and we both got super into watching it) until I fell asleep.

As seems to be a theme in this thread, this spontaneous adventure around campus was far better than any planned date I‚Äôve ever been on. I really got to know him and had a lot of fun. "
looks like you've got a keeper right there my friend
"Mine is not exactly a date but it's a great memory nonetheless! 

I met this girl at pride a while back and a week later she went out with me and my friends. We went to a few pubs and just had a great time, at the end of the night we decided we wanted to go eat something and then everyone but me and her just went home so we decided to go to a bar nearby but couldn't go in because it was packed, so we just stood there talking and people watching for hours. Eventually we decided it was time to go home so we walked to a different place to get our ubers but ended up just sitting down and talking more lol and at one point I was like ""we should stay to see the sunrise"" kind of as a joke but she was cool with it so we did! so basically we just talked and had a nice time since 2am until almost 6am and we kissed before leaving so all in all a great experience. "
"First I asked this girl out via 6 slide power point presentation. When she agreed, I would take her out on a date she would never forget and boy was it unforgettable. 

I went to her house to pick her up. I was going to be all nice, walk up to the door and introduce myself to the family and what not. Instead she came running out of the house yelling ‚ÄúGET IN THE CAR! WE GOTTA GO!‚Äù

In complete fear, I got into the car, and we were outta there. 

The first thing I had set was dinner at this BBQ place. Now, I know that is unorthodox in the first place but we both love bbq so why not?

We get there and the place is empty. Yet some reason we still need to wait an hour before we eat. So I go to the bar and was ignored for about ten minutes by the bartender. Eventually the bartender came around and asked the people next to me wanted to drink. I was pissed off.

I told her what was up and she said ‚Äúfuck it, let‚Äôs leave.‚Äù

I go out to my car where I found that my car is blocked in by someone else. No idea who it belonged to and the car wasn‚Äôt running. About twenty minutes later someone comes out. A pizza deliver boy. He apologized and took off. 

We tried to go somewhere else for food but we ended up at an Outback Steakhouse. 

Then we didn‚Äôt know what else to do, so we randomly picked to go see a movie. What movie would you ask? How about the cult classic ‚ÄúCabin in the Woods‚Äù where we both didn‚Äôt know anything about it. We came out of the movie pleasantly surprised. 

I brought her home after. We talked about how crazy the night was and how we still managed to make it work. 

We just celebrated our two year wedding anniversary a little while ago. "
Hi I just wanted to say that Im glad you had such a great time hope it will work fine between you guys :)
"Better than being attracted to her body is being attracted to her personality. That's a true match, boi. However, I've never had a connection like that. It's priceless once you find it. 

Since I've seen people sharing their experiences, I'm gonna do so. Last week I was at a house party, just friends in the house having a great time. I've been single for over two years and didn't date ANYONE. But fortunately a girl came and kissed me after we had a few words and nothing more. That was a gentle-nice-sweet kiss, just lovely. It felt good after so long.

Good luck with your date, man. Hope you get a long just nice!"
"We had $15 in cash, so on a whim, we decided to buy 15 $1 lottery tickets.  We ended up winning $20 off our first batch, so instead of accepting it, we cashed our winnings and then bought 20 tickets.  We continued doing this, through some streak of dumb luck, until the machine ran out of $1 tickets and the cashiers refused to continue cashing our tickets.  We ended up with over 70 lottery tickets in the end.  We didn't win anything in the end, but it lasted us a good couple hours. "
So you talked during a date? How unorthodox!
"This is awesome and made me smile. If you haven‚Äôt, take a picture with her, so that you can look back at your second date. (Don‚Äôt wanna jump the gun here, but you two sound REALLY good together and if you do eventually end up getting married, you can look back on that picture) üòä"
I'll let you know if I ever go on a date
Went out with a protestant once. 
We never called it a date but...she took me out to these things called the Duck Mobiles on my 18th birthday. (I think that‚Äôs what they were called) They were old U Boats turned into duck themed boats for tourists and they took you around the Bay Area as you could drive on land and sea. M was always so funny and creative when she wanted you to feel special. We‚Äôre both onto better things but I hope I can find a way to top that date. 
February 30th.
Dates like that don't come along too often.. whether it's friends or a romance. This made me smile today. I wish you guys all the best. ‚ù§
My husband took me to a cider mill on our first date:) we got cider and donuts and walked down their trails- it was nice
"Do a penny date. Get any coined currency, get into a city, pick a number and flip the coin. Heads is right, tails is left. Once you hit the number you specified. Find a place to park and pick the closest food place to you,"
"I dont know if it counts because we were already dating, but one time me and my (now ex) girlfriend just went out of her house (i was spending the week there) and simply started walking while chatting.

Went for a whole hour before any of us realized we had no idea where we were going. I miss her.


Another one, i went out with this girl to eat something, like a normal date, but it started to rain and instead of running for cover, she pulled me to play in the rain. we spend like half an hour running and playing there, getting soaked to the bones. Next day both of us were sick like hell, but it was worth it."
"16 December 2016, date number three, spent in emergency. Shame our relationship barely started, let alone lasted, because it's a damn good story.

I had a dinner and she had a work Christmas party, after which we were going to meet up and go for a drink. So we're on our way to meet up, talking on the phone to try find each other when I slam my head into the corner of a building. I somehow managed not to drop my phone and cursed loudly, and felt the blood running down my face immediately. I'd struck myself just above my left eyebrow almost where it stops at the top of the bridge of my nose. 

Now you're probably wondering how someone does such a thing. Keep in mind I am legally blind and it was 10pm, so it's dark and I am night blind and had missed the building with my cane. Some also claim the six glasses of red I had were a contributing factor. I strongly dispute such claims. 

I tell her ""Uh, I think we are gunna need ot go to emergency"" - keep in mind we still hadn't found each other. I walked to the next intersection (just passed the building I hit). I tried calling out to a car at the traffic lights for assistance. They wisely ignored me. I crossed the road and thought I saw someone wanting to cross the other way. I called out to them, but it turned out it was a statue or art piece. Or at least, that's what I thought. It did in fact turn out there was someone and also an art piece! I said to this girl ""I'm bleeding"" to which she responds ""Holy shit, you are"" or something like that. It wasn't serious. Head wounds bleed a lot, and it was possible I'd need a couple of stitches, but I thought they might be able to tape or superglue it too, so it was pretty low level, just bleeding a lot.

As it turned out, the girl I was looking to meet up with was only 30 second saway, so the stranger didn't need to assist for long. We started walking to the hospital (perhaps a 5 min walk), but instead hailed a taxi, paid a stupid amount of money to travel all of 30 seconds, and ended up checking in emergency at about 10:30. 

We didn't get out until about 4:30am or get home till about 5:30am. She had to work at 9am.

We saw some pretty crazy things in emergency though:

* A guy was out the back behind a glass door screaming that he just wanted to be put in a cell as security or police restrained him.
* A guy in a suit came in, I think for a blood test to prove he wasn't DUI. This other girl in the waiting room got talking to him and showed him the injury she had (a bust up toe or foot) to which he threw his arms up in the air and just went ""yeah, I'm out"" and just left.
* That same girl later got punched in this head by this other woman for no reason. The woman literally got up, walked over to her, clocked her, and walked out. No words were spoken.
* The most insane thing was when we finally got out the back. This guy had his armed wrapped up, he'd cut it up on glass somehow. He kept trying to upwrap it and the nurses were getting annoyed (he was pretty blitzed). Then he asked to go to the toilet, in which he started smoking after popping a bunch of pills. They shut that down pretty quick, but then had to do the maths to ensure they didn't give him meds that caused him to OD. Then he just walked out. He was found 15 minutes later passed out on the lawn out the front the hospital. They got him back in, he was even less cooperative than before. They needed to x-ray his arm to ensure he had no glass in it, he just wanted them to stitch it. He eventually unwrapped his arm and pissed blood EVERYWHERE. Walls, floor, double doors to waiting room. Everywhere. And he walked out, once again. And then one of the nurses said ""Yeah, we need to get a cleaner out here because he's HIV positive."" And at that point I got a little worried.

The whole experience was pretty funny even at the time. Though the six glasses of red probably did contribute to that. The whole time the two of us are just talking, few kisses, usual sort of stuff. It's something I will never forget.

Oh, and the best part? I was playing a day/night game of blind cricket the next day. So I rocked up having hardly slept with my head all patched up. Good times. 

And that's the most unorthofox date I've ever been on, even if admittedly the unorthodox nature was unintentional."
U gotta start hittin that shit before she starts boning other guys!!!!
Those spontaneous decisions  really are the best. A coworker once told me she had never been to a hockey game so I bought tickets and went with her that same night! Absolute ballast for both of us
"I agree, the first ""non-date"" I had with my husband was just shopping. We lived on a college campus that had a street of shops along one side. We just strolled down the street, went to bookstores, music stores, whatever seemed interesting... and talked. It was great!"
"Hey (wo)man, I‚Äôm sending you all my hugs! I‚Äôve been in tough spots, but just know you can get through it, and I (and the rest of r/casualconversation) are always here. 

And yea, I hope we do too :)"
"I've been through a rough time the past 18 years, romantically."
Don‚Äòt think of it as too bad. Romantically I‚Äòve been through some rough 6 months. You wouldn‚Äòt want to know.
"That‚Äôs hilarious! It‚Äôs great how simple, funny things like that can become great memories"
"First date with my last girlfriend, some birds came a little close, and I was like ""please don't make fun of me, but I'm scared of birds."" even started defending myself saying it wasn't a big deal since almost everyone has an animal they are irrationally scared of. She replied ""I understand, personally I'm scared of butterflies"" and I just started laughing hysterically.

Not sure why she liked me actually... "
The first time I went to a cat cafe they served vegan food only. Is this the norm?
"Wait a minute, cat Cafe? Never heard about it, how does it work?"
Best date ever
You just didn't know at that time that the cat was actually your date!
Still got that pussy!
"Hahahaha, I bet that was a great best mans speech! And it‚Äôs really cool when you realize you don‚Äôt need to spend money or go out to have a great time with someone. "
"Wait, the World Market in town is also next to the Game Stop. Is that just a thing that these businesses do? Or are we neighbors?"
That sounds really awesome. 
"‚Äúwith my son‚Äôs dad‚Äù 
Made me laugh have an upvote "
"Hey, thank you for the kind words! And don‚Äôt worry about not going on dates, I never did for a very long time. Only recently did I start breaking out of my shell and this was actually the first real date I‚Äôve been on in quite a while. It‚Äôll happen and I hope you come back with stories to tell when it does :)"
Chicks don't like that blue skin. 
"I guess you‚Äôre right, I‚Äôve just never been on a date quite like that. It‚Äôs something I‚Äôve never thought about being an actual date, and the fact that it ended up being so fun and intimate was just totally unexpected in the best way. I think you‚Äôre right about how being so casual helped a lot. "
The zoo is always a good date idea. If you can‚Äôt have fun at a zoo then it‚Äôs probably not going to work out between us anyway. 
"Just wrote this in another comment in this thread, but it's amazing what a grocery store trip can tell you about your compatibility with someone haha"
"Sorry to hear that, but at least you had a good time."
Omg keep trying. Those are awesome dates. 
"I think a lot of it depends on your location honestly. I‚Äôll admit I‚Äôm not the most attractive person in the world by a long shot, but in my current location I‚Äôve had a good bit of success. I‚Äôve only been using it here for about a week but I‚Äôve gotten a fair amount of matches and a couple of dates and hookup out of it so far. But back where I was a few months ago(Hawaii) it was terrible. I quit after a few days because I got like 4 matches total and I only met with one of them. It‚Äôs a surprisingly good way to make friends though. If you‚Äôre new to an area(like I am) it‚Äôs really useful. I will say I also tried bumble and that app is a steaming pile of shit. It‚Äôs great for women(they have to say something first before you can) but I‚Äôve only gotten like 3 matches and only one of them actually messaged me lol"
"That sounds like a crazy fun date! Not sure I could do that, but it sounds like a blast!"
I totally did the pancake date too! It‚Äôs always fun to make something together
That's really cute. I cracked a smile while reading it.
Uh you‚Äôre sending some mixed signals here
"Hey there, is everything okay? "
Are you okay?
Haha my feelings exactly 
"I feel you. I genuinely am happy for op and people in strong relationships in general but I won‚Äôt lie, it can make me pretty bitter too. "
"This may sound silly, but I can really judge my compatibility with someone by our dynamic when we go on grocery shopping trips haha"
Hahaha I‚Äôll be sure to keep you updated on that. I can definitely say for sure I got really lucky :)
"Honestly they all get away. And then one doesn't. You go from feeling like the world's biggest loser, to the luckiest person alive. And eventually you don't even remember what life was like before that person came along. "
Did you ever learn what that girl had done??
"That's a lovely story, it's amazing how sometimes you can just know things like that :) Also happy cake day!
"
"Me too honey, me too.  Dated someone from Tinder for 4 months and things were going great and then... poof."
I‚Äôll make sure to extend an invitation when I know ;)
Lol no
"I love the Monterey Bay Aquarium! That sounds amazing, I didn‚Äôt know that was a thing you could do!"
"Hahaha there are a few other people asking for wedding invitations already, I‚Äôll keep you updated ;)"
"Hahaha, I‚Äôm trying not to fall in love too fast, but I can‚Äôt say it hasn‚Äôt crossed my mind :)"
"Hey man, getting that courage is the first step. For a very long time I never asked anyone because I was way too scared of rejection. Sometimes you just have to shoot your shot. There have been so many times I look back and wish I had. I kind of had this one on easy mode because I met her online, so there‚Äôs a lot less fear in being rejected than in person"
Well it's good you had ballast. Stability is very important at a hockey game.
"Thank you!  I‚Äôm tearing up a little, thank you so much for your response, it means a lot"
"I don‚Äôt have any words to add, I just share this wavelength."
"It's always darkest before the dawn, dude.
"
I had a blast. Still have the picture  :)
Glad you guys started out with a laugh :)
"She must have watched that one episode of spongebob. Still gives me nightmares, really"
Maybe they don't want the cats getting extra large from customers giving them scraps?
That sounds amazing! Where was it if you don't mind me asking
"id guess that theres a lot of overlap with cat lovers and vegans 

source: am a cat loving vegan "
"Where I went didnt serve food at all. They had drinks and some arcade games, but no food, which makes sense to me given you have, like, 30 cats around you. Ahaha "
"Theyre very popular in Japan, but few have started opening up in the states. The couple in Chicago both serve as no kill animal shelters. They go around the country getting cats from high kill shelters. Then people pay, like, $15 for an hour to just hang out in a room full of, like, 30 cats!
It was great. There were cats everywhere of all shapes and sizes. 
Since they act as a shelter, all the cats are adoptable... hence why I ended up getting one shortly after the date. Ahaha. 

I dont believe the ones jn japan are shelters and those one serve drinks and snacks (hence cat CAFE) "
"We've got one here in Munich too. Website is full of customers cuddling with cats, but when we went, the cats couldn't be arsed to even get within a 3m radius of the guests. Cats will be cats, I guess, but my vegan omelette wasn't good enough that I'll be going back. "
"Fuck yeah, i didüòé"
this.
"Ooh, I don't know! Southeast Louisiana for me."
They‚Äôre next to each other in my town too...
They tend to be in similar shopping areas. I doubt it's too uncommon.
"I'll make sure to tell about them if they happen, believe me."
You probably follow rules 1&2 of tinder
Some chicks think blue skin is hot.
"Movies are overrated first dates. How well can you get to know somebody while watching a movie? 

First impressions are important. I get it. You don't want to look cheap or like you're just looking for a hookup (unless you are?) but finding a way to have fun and communicate is always the way to go.

I do think you got a little lucky. Not just any girl could have fun walking around and laughing at books and movies, but that says something about her as well. If you can walk around a store with someone and have a great time, that says a lot about your chances down the road. 

She sounds really cool. Good luck to you! "
"No I would definitely say going to Walmart is an unusual first date. That being said, it sounded like fun!"
"100&#37; agree. I have only remained friends with one of my ex-partners, and MOST of our dates were grocery shopping together.  I'm not saying they're related, but they're related."
Oh... You get Pepsi... Alright.
It's okay. I didn't follow the two rules. 
"d'aw, thank you! "
"Definitely gotta second Tinder as a good way to meet people in a new city! I made a lot of friends through people I went on dates with in the last city I lived in. I recently moved to a small town though, and both Meetup and Tinder are pretty sparse unfortunately."
"Stick with it! A lot of it is searching for casual hookups, which is fine and dandy at times, but for a relationship it‚Äôs certainly searching for a diamond in the rough. I currently am dating a fantastic girl who I met off of Bumble. So it‚Äôs possible, but I do agree that it‚Äôs a jungle out there."
Where are you using it that it was successful for you?
"It was actually not that much of a badass thing. We just climbed a fence, which wasn't very high or anything and walked around. Real fun though."
"thank you! i smile when i think about it now. we spent more than a year hating each other after but we became acquaintances again! i‚Äôm not sure about her but i‚Äôm at a much better place in every sense, hope she‚Äôs the same."
"kinda see where she's coming from. I read the story and I AM happy for you, but also very jealous it hadn't happened for me. congratulations, hope it works out for yall"
"I'm happy for you. I've just been through a lot of shit.

I'm glad that your date went well and hope it continues to go well for the both of you! "
Happy cake day!
This is beautiful. 
"Yeah, I suppose you're right. I'm not yet of the age where one might seriously stick around. "
"Her and her boyfriend were driving in a stolen vehicle around downtown. The cops ID‚Äôd the car and begin pursuit. Once they entered the more residential part of my city they backed off but the heli stayed on them. The bf bailed and she kept driving, eventually stopping where she did."
Thank you!!!
Can I bring a plus 1 to the wedding? 
"Oh dear... it was late, in my defense"
[removed]
"Of course! And I really mean it, if you want to talk, PM me. I promise I‚Äôll respond. I‚Äôve found casualconversation to easily be the best community on reddit because we all want positivity"
My life must be one big winter solstice then
"Scientifically inaccurate, but yeah, feel better!"
"Oh god, I thought I wanted to be a cat. My dreams are now revised and I want to be a cat in a cat cafe"
Not OP but my gf and I went to the one in DC and it was awesome
I live in Chicago. Theres actually 2 here. I believe
"Dude, that sounds awesome, will definitely try to visit one next time I visit the US

thanks, and congrats on the new cat! (You forgot to pay the cat pic tax though)"
Ahahah lol
My town too...
"Don't be hard on yourself, Thrawn. Who wouldn't pass the opportunity to engage a blue man. You'll be drowning in pussy soon enough."
Okay I‚Äôll bite. What are the first and second rules of tinder?
"I think it's more along the line of ""chicks don't like a guy that studies art then proceeds to destroy their world"""
"As a shy person, I like movie dates. There's no pressure and you already have at least one topic to talk about when you go for dinner afterwards."
"Same here, same here"
"What are these ""2 rules""?"
Don‚Äôt really want to give away my location but I‚Äôll say it‚Äôs on the east coast
That's a Shit Happens kind of thing I guess. People change and drift apart. But I'm happy you're cool with the past.
Then you have a lot of experiences ahead. Including the best times of your life. 
My SO now was the same way as your story. Met on tinder then went to Starbucks. They kicked us out because it was getting late. So we sat outside for a few hours. Fast forward to now and we have a 5 month old daughter. Tinder is what put us together and I love it.
"Nah, she's tired from fuckin my fatha. "
Username checks out
You know what happens after a long ass dead winter. Ragnarok.
"Well that sucks; sorry to hear it. :(

Have you covered all the basics? (E.g., showering, having interests, being able to make people laugh?) Apologies if this is going over old ground but I have to ask."
"Human: ""Hi, I'd like to adopt that grey cat, the super sweet one that I fed earlier and is now laying in the sun while being fed by more people.""    

Grey cat: ""Like hell you will! Fuck off with that adoption shit and let me be fat right here."""
Thanks! I didn‚Äôt know there was one in DC üôÇüôÉüôÇüôÉüê± Do you mind telling me what it‚Äôs called?
"Damn, long way from arizona. To my knowledge there isn't one in arizona, or at least nowhere near me. I guess to google I go!"
"http://imgur.com/RnacrZB

His name is Pepito "
"1: be attractive
2: don‚Äôt be unattractive "
"Idk, I think some would see that as very manly and attractive. Very assertive *and* intelligent, you could say."
Fair enough. Why do you think that location is more successful for you than others?
He deserves upvotes for the accuracy.
Yeh. But I only recently started going out the clubs and bard and meeting people through those ways. Previously I have just been rejected by people from my school which is a small sample
Crumbs and whiskers
"This one was located in Austin, Texas."
There's one in LA
im squealing
"Those are rules for life, not exclusive to Tinder :)"
"Well at least for Hawaii so many people there were just on vacation for a little while, and they just wanted to find a hot surfer dude to hook up with for a night and leave. A lot of fairly wealthy, attractive people vacationing in one spot makes it a lot harder to find anything else, and I found that they were unlikely to even give me the time of day lol"
Keep at it. Things will happen.
And many more ways to interpret it other than looks to be attractive
"There's a different meaning to it on Tinder though. If your physical appearance by itself isnt enough to attract people, you don't have the chance to meet anyone on there"
"I also feel like this little tidbit has changed my mood lately, a healthy body= a healthy mind, never knew my brain and body could work together like that, not saying I‚Äôm a fitness guru but when I‚Äôm healthy I feel mentally strong."
"Precisely!

Attractiveness comes in lots of shapes and sizes. Being attractive means you're magnetic, people want to be around you which might mean you're always smiling, happy, etc; and not being unattractive means avoiding traits, behaviors, and lifestyles that push people away. Being physically attractive can go a long way for step one, but usually attractive people with shit personalities, behavior, hygiene, etc probably won't create a ton of meaningful relationships with good people.

1. Be attractive: smile, bathe, wear fitting clothes, greet people, help others, and otherwise be outwardly energetic (consistent exercise also helps!)
2. Don't be unattractive: avoid shitty behaviors, don't smoke, don't belittle others, don't act like a dick, etc.

That's how I see it, anyway."
"For most people I‚Äôd definitely agree, but there are a couple people out there who will have problems with relationships no matter what. I‚Äôm pretty confident and outgoing, not to brag too much but most people really like me. But at the same time I look 15 while actually being 20, which definitely impacts my life quite a bit. People are often hesitant to hang out with someone who looks like their little brother their mom made them take lol. I find girls are more likely to hang out with me, but none are really interested in dating (can‚Äôt blame them, I wouldn‚Äôt want to date someone who looks like me either). I‚Äôve even gotta be careful with flirting, as much as I like it some girls get uncomfortable being flirted with with someone who looks like their still in grade 9. 

Idk maybe a few years down the road I‚Äôll be able to grow out a beard and look more my age but for now romanticism is more or less out of the question unfortunately. "
It's sad that something painful had to be the start of a better relationship. Hopefully this works out better for you two from this point on.
"That's so sweet! Sorry to hear about the ankle though, but I guess you wouldn't be haha!"
Well done for doing such a good job raising him! 
That's great to hear about your son! Breaking an ankle can be a tough process to go through mentally and emotionally and it's great that he's there for you
Some people act better under pressure! You should be proud
Ah I got both a fracture and sprain on my ankle when I was younger. It was a bad couple of weeks. 
You should put this on /mademesmile too
thank you!
Aw thank you for your encouragement! He‚Äôs going to be a good man.
Thank you! It‚Äôs not a big deal at all compared to seeing him be my hero! :)
So proud! 
"Because of the pain? Mine hasn‚Äôt been so bad with the meds. I‚Äôm not looking forward to the logistics of dealing with the crutches for the next few weeks though, and not being able to drive possibly."
"you do the best you can trying to teach them how to get along in life, and it's nice to see the payback in the good they do when you're not around, and that he's willing to come running when you called... even better."
"I sprained my ankle playing volleyball in school, had to be on crutches for a month. My whole body was sore, and I can't imagine how having responsibilities as a grown up and dealing with crutches would be. So best of luck to you!"
"Not because of the pain, it was just annoying to walk around on crutches all the time. "
Thank you! I‚Äôve been thinking about it and I actually have it pretty good since I can work from home a lot. I‚Äôve heard that sprains can hurt worse than breaks. You poor thing!

Boooo! Lucky lovey dovey couple.... Lol Breakfast without asking for it is always a bonus. 
"You two are adorable.

I see my wife off on the train each morning and am there when she arrives home.  She has this goofy little wave she gives me which melts my heart.  I tend to make her breakfast and then make too much which makes her complain about how im fattening her up.  We watch kids movies and then tease each other a bit for tearing up during the beautiful moments.  We make bad puns and complain like old couples.

We're not perfect and we've had our rough patches but in a world of cynicism and snarky attitudes she wears her heart on her sleeve and is honest and open and I cant imagine not having someone like that in my life.



"
"He does so many things I can't even name them all. Basically we are really good to each other and take care of each other, something neither of us has had before."
"Last summer he brought me flowers into my office while I was at work. Not for any special reason, just because he knows I love flowers and wanted to do me something good."
"Great for you, that sounds awesome and your relationship is definitely something for others to reach for! Too bad I've been single all my life haha."
"My SO and I are big on physical touch. It‚Äôs one of our top love languages. At least once or twice a week we will light incense, put in relaxing music, break out the lavender massage oil and spend an hour or two giving each other massages. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"I love fried chicken. Like...really, really love fried chicken. You know what I love more than fried chicken? Dipping sauces. Doesn't matter what kind. I don't discriminate.

A new chicken joint opened up down the street from my work and I was dying to try it. So on his day off, my boyfriend went and ordered the biggest portion of chicken tenders they had with ALL the dipping sauces and suprised me at work.

It was the sweetest damn thing and I cried."
I'm a newlywed. My husband had been steadily feeding me gooey fresh baked oatmeal chocolate chip cookies. Life is good.
"aww this is so wholesome!!   
I had a bit of breakdown once and was in a not so safe area and he came and got me and let me go over to his to sleep it off"
"Love you too, babe!"
Awesome! It‚Äôs the little things that mean the most. Happy for you!
"Mine ate an entire raw onion for five bucks, which he gave me for gas money. We went to college on other sides of the state. Still togetger almost seven years later. He's done a million sweet things since then."
I simply do not belong in this thread. 
Nice!
"op thats adorable :) i wish you two the best in life.
the night before my final for one of my uni courses, i was round my partners (we lived across the city from eachother, we‚Äôve moved in together now!!) and had taken off my good luck necklace i was wearing through the exam period. i forgot to put it back on before i left, and he showed up at midnight in an uber just to get it back to me before i‚Äôd even realised i‚Äôd forgotten it "
would if i could ha..ha...ha.....
There are way too many for me to write down lol my man treats me like a queen! We have been married for 15 years and he still will surprise me with flowers or will have the house cleaned up when I wake up so I don‚Äôt have to do it. Not sure what I did to deserve him but I am so grateful for him 
Nobody cares about your chemical reactions
"I don‚Äôt believe in love. I sit in an empty grey room being drip-fed my food, waiting to die"
THANK YOU!!!!
Definitely!
I am quite lovey
"That's so sweet! And you're right, you always need a good balance between cynicism and optimism, I'm glad your wife is your anchor for that! How long have you two been together?"
I'm so happy to have read this. I just got out of a one sided relationship and all I want now is for a partner to be as good to me as I am to them and I'm glad that's not a fantasy üòä
"Wow, I can't think of anything better than that. Lucky you"
A good boyfriend and good food. Is there anything more a girl wants üòå
"You're welcome..! <3

Edit: Wait was that sarcasm"
"Definitely key to a healthy relationship - at least in my opinion haha.

Coming up on 6 years here."
"My mom was getting frustrated because she kept finding orange shavings in the shower drain. At this time, my sister's boyfriend started staying with us, so she assumed it was him that was weirdly eating oranges in the shower. So, my mom goes to my sister and says ""hey, please tell your boyfriend to keep food out of the shower because it clogs up the drain"". Cut to my (at times hostile) sister being really weirded out and annoyed that my mother would assume something so bizarre of him. My mother kept asking my sister to tell him to stop for about a week and my sister would always just shrug her off because, well, why the hell would her boyfriend be eating oranges in the shower? After enough of this, my sister finally goes to her boyfriend and asks if he's doing it. He says no. Confusion strikes. How the hell are orange shavings getting in the drain? Cue my entire family being questioned about this (up until this point I had no idea this was going on because I guess nobody expected me to be the culprit) and the ""shower orange"" debate started up in my family. At one point we all sit down for breakfast and my sister mentions it passive aggressively because she was getting annoyed. After hearing her mention it, I go ""oh yeah it's a thing online, I've been doing it lately"". Without my anticipation, my entire family finds themselves in uproar. ""IT'S YOU. YOU'RE THE SHOWER ORANGE EATER. YOU'RE THE ONE CLOGGING UP THE DRAIN. WHY THE HELL ARE YOU EATING ORANGES IN THE SHOWER."" I was shocked. I had no idea this was an issue. I explain to them the concept of aromatherapy (it was a bullshit explanation but I needed to say something) with the astonished looks on all their faces. It still gets brought up at every familiy reunion."
Idk bout oranges but I've eaten bacon in the shower..
"The juice pouring down your chin and into the drain is juice that you could be having for yourself.


Eating an orange in the shower is one of the worst ways to eat an orange.

"
"r/ShowerOrange

Also try a shower beer, it‚Äôs the greatest. No glass!"
"That was popular like a really long time ago and I wonder why you'd be eating an orange in the shower now? I considered trying it back when the concept was popular but I don't really like oranges. I can't try this now though since being out of season here, I'd have to go out of my way to find someplace where they have oranges."
"I'd always thought that the orange would heat up because of the warm water, then it won't be as nice, is that the case?"
"But, I'm too lazy to buy an orange."
It's this a joke? Anyway. Tried it...I felt like I was homeless.
Good for you!  I'm very glad that you enjoyed it.  
Sounds amazing actually. Have to try this tomorrow and join in the bliss!
"I'd go with a super juicy peach, myself"
Im allergic to oranges :(
"I don't like oranges, just the smell makes me hold my breath and look for a way to flee from it lol 

Good for you though! "
But what about cleanup? I don't think I could enjoy this knowing all the cleanup of peels I have to do.
">Eat in the shower

>No Rules

[Heaven](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLUAib0N6WA)"
"I legit forgot I did that like 1 year ago. It was truly a great experience, it sounds like sarcasm but it‚Äôs actually not, go try it"
I will eat popsicles in the shower. Now THAT is better than oranges for me.  
Shower snacks! My SO and I are fans of the juice filled fruit snacks. I'll have to try an orange sometime though! 
"I used to drink a beer in the shower at uni, I might try the oranges too now that I am a responsible adult!"
I really like eating oranges while super baked in the hot tub. It‚Äôs a blast to do with friends.
[Here‚Äôs something to inspire you if you wanna step your game up.](https://youtu.be/zFyUn_4uL5E) 
I brush my teeth in the shower. 
Worth the read
Have an orange arrow! 
Hahaha! Our shower is basically just a bath with a shower sticking off the wall. So I put a bin at the end of the bath and as I ate I chucked them in there. It was like playing basketball
This reads like a That 70s Show episode
Life goals right here yall. 
Sounds greasy
I didn‚Äôt actually lose any juice. I guess you don‚Äôt have to worry about your face being sticky after. The juice is the best though! Freshly squeezed by my teeth
"What about and orange with a beer to wash it down..

Anand now were just talking about a sauna."
Y'all be wasting shitloads of water lol
"Why no glass?

Also do you mean no glass bottles or no glass cups? Cups seems obviously a no no, but I was planning to glass bottle-it later today"
"I second the shower beer.  Better than the shower orange, IMO."
Does it work with a can of soda too?
"I live in the Southern Hemisphere, so we‚Äôve got nice oranges at the moment. It only really came to my attention now"
I didn‚Äôt notice that really. 
This was my main complaint with shower orange. Biting into it just isn't as refreshing as it would be on dry land. It's just....warm orange.
Enjoy!
That sucks :(
eat a tangerine instead
"Nah, peeling an orange is clean. 3 peels left in the shower at most"
As long as it stays out of the shower.
Gree-eee-eeeasssyyy
"That's why you should eat the orange out of the shower, and not like a monster. So that every last drop is yours."
You drink too slow. 
You don‚Äôt want to have an accident while consuming alcohol. I pour my beer in a Yeti Lowball. 
"Maybe? The appeal with beer is that it‚Äôs bright, cold, and fresh against the feeling of hot water. Not sure a thick, sugary soda would have the same effect. 

I bet orange juice would work!"
"I've drank cans of club soda in the shower the past two days after working outside. It's fucking liberating.  Such a great feeling.  

Shower beers are better, but after working outside, I sometimes have a headache and the water helps.  "
"Haha, so you're just a bit late. Back then I remember seeing a bunch people trying this in their shower and posting it on YouTube. Reading some other comments on the thread you just linked, there is one person who suggested doing your experiment whilst being in a pitch black shower and playing some loud music. Try it if you're up to the challenge and report back here. :)"
"Wait but even if you eat the orange on a plate outside the shower, if you drop the juice, you still can‚Äôt get it back. Unless you want to lick it off the floor. You just have to eat the orange carefully "
Eating it like a monster is the point.
"Fair play. I'm still doing the glass bottle then, and simply signing and imaginary waiver. Thanks for the heads up."
I'll try it
"Hmn, might try this sometime"
Sounds like a plan!
"Eat it segment by segment. Put the segment in your mouth, close your mouth, chew. No juice escapes, you have all the juice, and you don't have to take a shower to eat your orange."
"Try not to hurt yourself though, seems like the easiest way to slip and break a hip!"
Okay okay. I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôve just had an argument about eating an orange. 
Can't you do that in the shower too?
":D

Thanks for being a good sport about it.

A person that can carry an argument about shower-oranges must be an alright sort."
"Why even bother having the shower then if you‚Äôre going to eat it like a normal person?


If you have a shower every time you eat an orange and vice versa,   that‚Äôs a; wasteful, and b; stupid. 

If you have to wait till you shower to eat am orange, that‚Äôs restricting your life. What if you want to have an orange for lunch at your work? Tough shit, you can‚Äôt. Wait until you go home. 


And if you‚Äôre only having a shower whenever you eat an orange, then you‚Äôre gross. 


There is no acceptable combination of oranges and showers. "
"It's always nice watching a movie with hand drawn animation. I appreciate the skill involved, not that computer animation doesn't involve skill! Sometimes I just think that computer animation is a little cold. "
"If you look at the animation in the old Snow White Disney movie, the colors and effects for 2d were absolutely beautiful. Although 3D type animation is more realistic, I just don‚Äôt think it captures the beauty that some 2d animation has. "
"My kids and I love Studio Ghibli and Cartoon Saloon! There‚Äôs nothing like that shot of Kiki resting in the grass listening to the radio, or Totoro and the the girls growing up the acorns, I could go on. Every still of Song of the Sea is beautiful art. There‚Äôs so much more feeling and beauty conveyed in those cells somehow.  I think it would be possible to do that in 3D style, but I haven‚Äôt seen it very much. I think Mune might be a good example of the latter. "
"Yeah, I kind of miss when flash animation was mostly restricted to the internet (say before 2006) and was mostly a novelty on TV (exceptions including Mucha Lucha and Foster's Home For Imaginary Friends).  Fortunately traditional animation is far from dead in places like Japan and Europe.  CGI can be just as good as traditional, though, and I think its quality has been getting better and better.  "
"I would say treasure planet did a mix of 2D and 3D really well, using scenes with the boat for 3D and a close-up/fight scene with 2D."
"I think part of the issue is that the 3D animation look so similar, even across studios. It seems like after the initial success of Pixar, everyone is trying to imitate them and their style. The Lego Movie was able to create an 3D computer animated film that didn't feel the same which was really refreshing! I really like some of the short films that get attached to Disney and Pixar films. A lot of times they have a bit more varied animation styles which are really beautiful.

I am really looking forward to Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. The animation looks beautiful in this one!"
"Yes, very much so. I recently re-watched some of my all time favorite Disney movies and they were all 2D ones. I just think there is something so calming about them. Even though I don't dislike 3D, I think the old school 2D ones are just more wonderful."
"I grew up during a time where 2D animation seemed to be kind of phasing out and being replaced with 3D in a bunch of movies and shows, but as a kid I still adored films like the Snow White and The Fox and the Hound, as much if not more than the ones that came out during my lifetime. I'd love it for a Disney feature film to be animated like that nowadays! Ultimately, however, I believe any good film (or cartoon) is a good story first and foremost, and any medium that can tell that story well is one i'm willing to give a chance. "
"Exactly. I'll take two examples of cartoons I've watched a bit of.


Steven Universe is a cartoon network show that's handdrawn. It's cute, endearing, but the art style of being hand drawn allows for some much more creativity, nuance, and charm. It allows for the characters to express themselves better. Never got into the show, but the art was great.


Teen Titans Go is flash animated. Everything seems so artificial and lacking character expression besides exaggerating certain parts. It's hard to show emotion and express certain feelings.


But flash animation is always going to be cheaper and faster. It's way more cost-efficient and it's the real moneymaker.


[**also CHECK OUT THIS ANIMATION**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqJQAgBPBSA). It's so whimsical and charming. All these animations, and some on youtube from students as their theses or projects are always, in my opinion, better than the flash stuff you see on TV. [Boom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRpiBvwKX6c). [Another one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54MIOgpKl5A). [Another one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRpiBvwKX6c). They're all great."
"That's something I still try to get my parents to understand. Just because a computer is involved doesn't mean it requires no skill. CGI on the other hand, that's just an excuse for laziness in my opinion"
What are your thoughts on how some long running cartoons switched to computers over hand drawn? The Simpsons for example
I love when video games play with that sorta artstyle. Jet set radio could easily be converted to a cartoon for example since its art style is so similar  to hand drawn
"Have you watched the Secret of Kells? It's visually stunning, and I believe by the same people as Song of the Sea."
But with computers you dont notice the little animation errors! I remember watching a KoTH episode where Bobby got a soda from the fridge and it was a beer for a few frames after. It's fun to look for those little things.
I feel like a fake animation fan saying I haven't watched that movie lol. But that era of Disney is pretty nostalgiac for me so sign me up!
I'm not even into Marvel but that trailer for Spiderman has me sold for its art style alone
*The Heist* was really good. All of then were really good. Damn.
Practical visual effects are so much better! 
Its amusing to me that you don‚Äôt see the hypocrisy in your post. 
"I have not really watched the simpsons much, so I can‚Äôt really comment on it. I‚Äôm much more familiar with the Disney progression. I think that tv shows should stick with what they originally did, but computers can make things so much easier and faster, so I see why they do it. "
"It irks me, especially when it‚Äôs a weird mesh of computer animated graphics. One example (from The Simpsons) that comes to mind is an episode where Marge pours a bunch of prescription drugs on a table and it‚Äôs this god-awful computer rendering. 

Another example similar to that is how they animate the cars in Family Guy recently. It doesn‚Äôt mesh well with the aesthetic of the show in my opinion."
"Yeah! Also, I‚Äôm forgetting my pre-kids animation faves: Akira, Tekkon Kinkreet, and Paprika were mind-blowing. "
"Oh yes! It‚Äôs amazing! It‚Äôs by the same people, yeah. "
What do you mean by that? I guess effects that are only necessary?
I didn't really have a better way to explain it lol. I realized this as I typed it up but they get the point
"I agree with keeping the consistency. Maybe its because I dont watch a lot of live TV, but I wouldn't mind waiting longer for a cartoon to release because of the slowness of hand drawn animation. Quality over quantity for sure!"
"I noticed the later episodes of Futurama really had that issue with the ships flying around. It would've been a huge pain to draw all that out, but I'm sure there was some better solution to make it a better presentation."
"I'm more into Cartoon Network and old school animation so I'm unfortunately not familiar with those. But the few snippets I've seen of some foreign animation sure have hypnotizing assets. Even if I don't know what's going on, I sometimes watch animations just to admire their art style."
"They mean that he prefers it when in a movie they take the time to build and pull off something rather than completely relying on CGI to make it. 

Puppets, set pieces, actual explosions, things like that. "
Oh for sure. I love the home made feel of the original star wars trilogy for that reason.
exactly! 
"Try meal prep, its healthy and easy. Go to youtube and you will find plenty of easy to follow cooking tutorials. And congratulations!"
"Congratulations, mate! I also worked in a cubicle office in my early 20s.

I always eat the lunch in the canteen, because Im too lazy to cook myself something for work every day.

First thing you need for your cubicle is obviously an awesome mug. And personally, I liked to decorate it with post cards."
"Were you a full time student or did you break your classes up? Im trying to figure out the best way to utilize my GI bill. Once I figure out a major that is.

And as far lunches I'd recommend meal prepping. Fortunately if I forget my lunch I can just wait til I get off at 2:30 and eat a snack before dinner."
"I went to school full time when I got out and worked part time jobs bartending or bouncing for nightclubs and bars, mainly for extra spending money.

9/11 GI Bill paid for my tuition, books, and I got a housing stipend based on zip code which was great cause I live in the Bay Area and the rent here is outrageous.

I'm actually still in school doing my MBA online and at nights.

If you're EASing soon then know you don't have to use the GI Bill right away you have up to 15 years. I worked in retail management for a couple years after I got out and I fucking hated it so i went back to school. 

I would say give yourself at least 12-18 months to adjust to civilian life before you go full on college, maybe take some classes at a local CC to get an idea of how a college class is. Then get into the best school you can and don't worry about cost. GI will cover your full tuition for public universities and up to 23k for private and foreign Universities. But a lot of private schools have scholarship programs for veterans that cover the difference between GI and full tuition, which is what I ended up doing about half way through. "
You have to be full time student in order to use your post 9/11
Which is why I'd be using the MGIB.

Welcome to the Mitten state. Where are you moving from?
"Man, I love meeting people from the internet.  I've always been a big gamer too and I've met so many people from the internet now it's sort of dizzying to think about... the first time was when I was around 13, and a friend of mine I had played Diablo 2 with happened to live in the same city that I was going to to do some mission work in Mexico.

I'm currently roommates with who is basically my best friend now.  I was living in Colorado and he asked if I wanted to live in LA rent-free as long as I painted his bathroom for him.  So I did, and then he came back to Indiana with me (long story) when I went back to school here.  Had never met him face-to-face in my life before I decided to move from CO to CA to live with him.

Next month a buddy of mine I met playing CS 1.6 with around 2004 is going to be driving through my city and we're gonna meet for the first time.  Man I love meeting people from the internet."
"That‚Äôs awesome!
My fianc√© and I met a friend through insta who lives in the Netherlands. (We are in the US). And he came to visit us for a cross country road trip last year! It was a blast. "
"Awesome! 

Pretty great when you can meet someone that you've met that way. I wasn't able to make it, but one of my friends from my clan online invited me to his wedding, even though I couldn't go I know we'll meet up one day. "
"I loved it, sad we had to get but we actually arange to meet again tomorrow which has made me really happy! I traveled half way across the country (mind you this is in England and I was going west so not too far but still considerable distance) and I hope to go visit a few friends in the UK and in the EU soon once I have passed my driving test!"
"It was honestly a stroke of luck, she messaged me one night at around 2am my time (UK) saying she would be visiting the UK and wanted to meet me in person so we arranged it around 2 months ago and today was the day. It was awesome and I hope you guys get to meet up one day!"
"Nice! It‚Äôs fun to meet people that are outside of your comfort zone. I think it helps round you out more as a person, and you get to see how other countries operate from an actual first hand experience. 

I would absolutely love to go to the UK, I majored in British history in college (main focus the reformation era) I would just nerd out the entire time üòÇ"

Depends how addicted you are to you're laptop i guess. I personally would have no problem. Literally the only thing i use my laptop for anymore is browsing reddit when i don't want to do it on my phone. lol

What made you want to try this?
"Everything depends on case you use your laptop/smartphone. For example, I'm fine doing quick job tasks from my phone, for example on my way to office. But when I leave town for a while, I should take my laptop cause if happened something complex and difficult - it's nothing to do with phone."

"Cute. Congratulations - you've got 2 friends.

"Do you want to be - nope never mind, can't do it. Adult awkwardness holding me back. üò≠üòÖ"
"I think that's normal, in life we weed out people who we don't need or want and we're left with the rest. That's fine too because even though they may not necessarily be friends, you come across people everyday regularly that make it easier it pleasant. 

I work at a grocery store and I see people everyday and talk to them, my co-workers help relieve my dress and get me through the day. We're acquaintances at best but that's ok."
Most of my friends became my friends because they approached me first. I'm a pretty shy person.
"Sure, even I need friends :D"
Your kid is legitimate. Respect! üç™
"I feel like when we're younger, we're less taxing on other people. As I've grown older, I've lost friends simply because keeping the friendship going got too hard. It's usually because of distance, frequency of visits, and getting out of sync. But even the good ones change and sometimes those changes affect your mental health passively. I just came back after hanging out with someone I consider a good friend for about 6 years but he did something petty and I couldn't handle it so I left. I think there's a reason why having Good‚Ñ¢ friends is so rare and it's easy to have casual friends because when you're vulnerable with someone, sometimes they don't like what they see. "
"its sad that it is considered ""weird"" nowadays to go up to random people just to say hi. I'm glad your daughter is doing it anyway."
"I guess only if you asked a woman, I‚Äôm sure it would be easy enough to strike up conversation with another man and become friends."
I don't think so. It depends on how you say it. And your fashion of course! 
"Right, when you're a kid you never really have to consider that the other kid who is asking to be friends might be doing so with the ulterior motive of murdering or robbing you."
"If it seemed genuine, I‚Äôd adore someone who approached me in this way. 

I‚Äôm aware that‚Äôs not all people, but still. "
Wanna be my friend? 
I honestly think most people would say yes though 
You need some candy! 
hit me up!
That‚Äôs why I love that my daughter isn‚Äôt afraid to do this. I was such a shy child I would have loved someone to come and ask for me to join in with their games. I love how she never wants anyone to be left out. We need more people in this world to make friends!
Why? O.o
That‚Äôs very insightful and I completely agree. It‚Äôs a lot of effort to maintain friendships as adults.

I hate goimg to the grosery store . i talk to my self all the time.. Trying to keep a tally of whats in my cart . or what i need next. And. I feel weird when people look at me 
I talk to myself sometimes but I also get pronouns mixed up in my head to the point where it's not uncommon for me to refer to myself as we instead of I. Honestly I think that's just because my mind mixes up stuff a lot. 
When I'm studying I'll talk to myself the entire time as if I'm tutoring someone. Sometimes I catch myself doing it in public places. It helps! But it definitely makes me look a bit insane.
"I get into a zone of saying most everything out loud, and kinda making myself laugh by saying things i find funny and kind of narate what I'm doing, when I'm in the woods camping alone. Find it very therapeutic and kinda fills the space and makes me feel less lonely. But i don't necessarily have full on convos with myself. Mostly just narrate. 

But it is possible that you're not crazy, you may have just picked this habit up and i dont think its anything to be ashamed of or worried about."
I love the rain so much and the smell... yes.
But then didn't you have to get in the car soaking wet?..
"Ofc especially when it‚Äôs been hot af and/or a while since it rained. Have fun on the road trip, definitely more fun as a passenger"
"I have dozens of times. Mostly as a child though. If you haven't gone swimming in the rain, you really should. Where are you road tripping to/from?"
"When I was a kid my uncle had a pool and would let me and my brother swim whenever we wanted , I remember one day *casually* mentioning that I was bummed out that it had been raining all day, my uncle said ""why are you scared to swim in the rain, it's just water and there hasn't been any lightning"" I ran out of the house so fast. As an adult I've swam in the gulf of Mexico while it was raining numerous times, it's such a surreal feeling. 10/10 would recommend"
 Love the rain so much. It‚Äôs sort of a stereotype to be in the dumps when it‚Äôs gloomy and rainy but it makes me feel so happy. I feel energized and blissful when I stand in the rain. Can‚Äôt even explain how much I love the rain
"Yes, The smell of the rain too! I think in my past life I was some spiritual rain dancer üòÇ"
Two beautiful words that I thought of when doing this: seat heat
Yeah I offered to drive but it‚Äôs ‚Äútoo dangerous‚Äù and I‚Äôm not ‚Äúexperienced‚Äù but I‚Äôm not complaining üòÇ
From ny to Lancaster PA
When I visited my friends in Florida they lived in an apartment complex that felt like a hotel. They had an outdoor pool on the first floor that we would swim in everyday. One day it was raining and we were enjoying ourselves and someone came around and said ‚Äúobviously you guys aren‚Äôt around here.‚Äù We were like yes but it was so easy to enjoy the pool in the rain. It was like a weird serene feeling.
"I feel the same way, it‚Äôs an experience that can‚Äôt be explained but only felt."
Yeah me too I wish it rained more where im from.
Haha lucky
"Can't really blame them if you're a new driver, though highway driving is easy unless there's traffic. Went on a road trip with my brother and dude drives like a maniac. He was tailgating everybody, last minute stops and barely slowed for turns."
"In the least creepiest way possible, where would that be? I live in New York and around this time we get a lot of nice rains."
Almost feels as good as the rain
My dad is on this medication that makes him REALLY slow so I would‚Äôve felt better if I was driving tbh. I am not inexperienced tho for sure I‚Äôve just never driven in that bad of a storm
"Come to lithuania in the summer, you might get lots of rain or veeeeryyyyyy nice views of the landscape, its not at all similar to NY, so should be a good change from the US of A (sorry for bursting in uninvited, just want to let you know of a good rain place)"
Texas lol
"Slow is good for bad weather. Only time I lost control was in a snowstorm. Thankfully cause I was driving like a snail, didn't hit a thing after spinning out."
I will totally consider that. I know a couple friends who live there and they always take these pretty pictures and I‚Äôm always hella jealous.
"Oh damn üòÇ, so rain is like a luxury."
Idk where you‚Äôre from but it rained in Texas plenty where I lived
Slow as in like slow reaction times so he would forget to brake and end up swerving to the right or left to avoid rear-ending the cars in front of him. That happened a couple of times so üëåüèº
In the Summer yes.
Oof yeah that doesn't sound too safe. My cousin has like PTSD cause of his friend who did that and got in an accident when he was in the car. Found out when I barely avoided a car coming out of a tunnel. 
Just come to ny for a while I got room my friend
I've been
Where‚Äôd you visit
You'll never guess
"Hmmm, can‚Äôt be NYC right?"
It was.
"Beer and leftover pizza. My wife is out of town for the weekend so I'm living the bachelor life to the max. Don't get me wrong. I usually do the cooking. And I cook freakin' well. But when you're alone, meh. "
"Been experimenting with homemade pizza! I made a bbq chicken pizza last night, maybe I'll make a cheesy deep dish tonight"
It‚Äôs too hot to cook so I‚Äôm making red peppers stuffed with tuna salad. 
"Wow, sounds great. I'm doing bratwurst on the grill with corn on the cob, with a grilled Caesar salad to go along with it...I make a homemade Caesar dressing, cut a head of Romaine lettuce in half longways (rinse well and drain dry). Use a pastry brush to push some of the dressing into the lettuce, then grill at high heat for a few minutes to get a char on some of the leaves. Top with more dressing. I also cut up a baguette and brush with roasted garlic olive oil and grill the slices until golden, top with grated parmesan and serve with the grilled lettuce."
I'm making Cajun chicken with ravioli and Alfredo sauce.  Currently trying to gain a bit of weight and have been making calorie packing meals lol 
Pizza ova here too!
3 bricks of ramen
I'm thinking of having a southwest salad with chili lime chicken. 
[deleted]
"Pork in adobo sauce, and rouladen with vegetable and bean rice. I don‚Äôt have enough of either to make a full meal so I‚Äôm making both. "
i haaatee cooking. i wish i liked it.
Either vegetable curry or a garlic pesto pasta. I'll see what my mood is after I hit the gym after work.
"I think we are probably just going to keep it simple tonight, if it's up to me to dicide I'll just have rice and corn tossed with chipotle Tabasco, with chopped onion, cucumber, and lime juice on top.  "
That sounds amazing!!! Grilling some steaks and baked potatoes with corn on the cob and a shrimp pasta salad
Food. 
100 proof captain and beans
"i made pasta caprese with buffalo mozzarella and garlic! I'm currently on vacation with a lot of family, so it's practical to make something that is easy to scale up."
No one out pizzas the hut 
"Already had mine, a fry up. Sunday is the only day of the week where I have one meal for the entire day."
"Pulled pork using a Red‚Äôs Barbeque kit we got free at a food festival in Manchester, with some corn on the cob. It was goooood!"
"I went to Fresh Market and found some chicken potstickers mislabeled for 32 cents, so probably that.  "
Duck breast and asparagus.
I know the feeling! Whenever my fianc√© is out of town I don‚Äôt even bother cooking. Leftover pizza is the best!
Yummmmmmmm!!!!! 
That sounds very delicious. I never had stuffed peppers with tuna salad. I want to try making the one day.
Wooooow!!! Sounds delicious! I never had romaine lettuce on the grill but it sounds very yummy. 
Yummmmm! I totally get it. Dinner sounds delicious.
What kind of pizza?
"I haven‚Äôt ate in over 15 years. My brother eats ramen for breakfast, lunch and dinner. "
Yummmmmm! I need to start eating more salads and this sounds like a very yummy one that I could definitely eat.
"I totally get it. When my fianc√© used to go away to college, I was by myself and it was hard to cook for just myself. Most of the time I would make pasta with sauce, smothered chicken with rice or all types of casseroles. I had to make sure those dishes lasted for days because I was college student myself and didn‚Äôt have a lot of money. "
Sounds yummy! 
I have my moments where I hate it. It takes time and patience. 
"You can never go wrong with curry! However, the garlic pesto pasta sounds yummier! "
I never had that all together but it sounds yummy!
Yummmmmmmmm!
I never had pasta caprese or caprese salad. I  hope your family loves it :)
What‚Äôs a fry up?
Yummm! Enjoy :)
Tried it last summer for the first time. I believe it is an America‚Äôs Test Kitchen recipe. 
What Cajun seasoning is your favorite?  Or do you make your own?  I used Tony's creole and some zatterans (sp?) blackening seasoning
"I'm poor and I can't cook worth a damn, lol.  So it' salways ramen here"
"I'd prefer others to cook for me, whether it be homemade or take out"
I don't have bacon for the pesto pasta so I feel like it'll end up feeling missing something. I might put cream cheese in it to do something a bit different and make it a bit more dynamic of a flavour
"it was a great success, there was enough garlic this time.

You seriously should try it. for three people you should use about 250g dry pasta (fusilli is best, i think), about one plant of basil, 300-400g mozzarella and approximately the same amount of tomatoes. We all like garlic, so we use three or four medium sized cloves of garlic. I also use probably 100 ml of olive oil.

dice the tomatoes and the mozzarella and mix it in a bowl. chop the basil leaves (i put it in a cup and cut it with scissors) as finely as you can be bothered to. crush the garlic in with the basil, cover it in olive oil and add about a teaspoon of salt. boil pasta and strain it, then mix everything together and serve!

Edit: accidentally posted too early"
"Ahh sorry just another name for a full breakfast, in my case I had: sausage, egg, bacon, black pudding, polony, lorne sausage, beans, toast and some tea, [looked a bit like this.](https://i.imgur.com/tZ08qcO.jpg)"
It was so good! Had it on a brioche roll with some of the Reds BBQ sauce and it was delicious
I made my own once but I didn‚Äôt like how it came out. I usually use Louisiana‚Äôs Cajun seasoning. I never used Tony‚Äôs but so heard nothing but things about Tony‚Äôs. 
I‚Äôll cook for you.
To be honest I never made pesto pasta or even the sauce. I always wanted to make it but never had the exact ingredients that I needed. The cream cheese would be definitely had flavor. 
Yummm! I think that maybe my dish for next Sunday. I‚Äôm always looking to make something different.
"Breakfast is my favorite meal of the day and your meal just won my heart, haha. Looks very delicious!"
Yumm! Wait you got a free bbq kit? That‚Äôs awesome!
"Ah, hate when that happens.  I've never had louisianas!  Tony's is amazing and I love using it when making baked Mac and cheese"
aww so sweet
"Yeah! Got about 4 different kits, and 4 sauces! Well worth the ¬£5 entry!"
I‚Äôll have to try tony‚Äôs next time. This is my first time using Cajun seasoning in Mac and cheese. 
Don‚Äôt wear it in public? I am supposed to wear my glasses 24/7 but I don‚Äôt in public because I don‚Äôt like how I look with them.
"I had braces twice and I‚Äôve had retainers twice (both the metal wire and the clear plastic ones). I was in elementary and middle school during this time, but honestly just wear them. I got lazy with my retainers and now I‚Äôve fucked up my teeth and it sucks. They‚Äôre not as bad as they were before I got braces but they‚Äôve definitely regressed a bit and I regret not just wearing what I was supposed to. 

Also I remember having the metal wire retainers. It‚Äôll give you a weird lisp for about a week but then your tongue sort of adapts and compensates for it. Trust me when I say it‚Äôll be a lot better to just wait it out and follow what you‚Äôve been told. We tend to judge ourselves more than other people do after all! "
"Honestly if I see someone with a retainer or braces it's never this ""WOAH"" kind of thing like you have a growth on your face, it's just ""oh this person is getting his/her teeth straightened out"" and then I forget about it because who really cares. 

So don't worry much about it, other people will absolutely not care too. It's just very common. "
Just wear them. Nobody cares. My only advice is if you get in a fight dont get hit in the mouth. Holy shit wires and braces and retainers make a mess. 
My orthodontist told me the same thing about my retainer although i had the one that was like a clear outline of you're teeth. wore it pretty consistently for like 2 months and then not nearly as much and then i lost it... and my teeth are just fine.
"Retainers aren‚Äôt that bad. I also had the problem of a lisp at first, but then I got the hang of it after a few weeks. You just have to practice talking in them. My orthodontist told me to wear it everyday for a year, and I hated taking it out when I needed to eat. You‚Äôll get used to it though. I only had to wear mine everyday for a year, then after that I just use it at night now. Went to the ortho a month ago and my teeth are still straight and fine. "
"Nah it‚Äôs something that‚Äôs like ordered by my ortho, and I feel like if I don‚Äôt wear them as much as I need to my teeth are gonna shift back and I‚Äôm gonna have to get braces again... it‚Äôs pretty frustrating"
Yeah I‚Äôve definitely been feeling that lisp so far.  But I‚Äôll stick with it and hopefully I‚Äôll get used to it really soon and not sound so weird like I currently do haha
"Alright, thank you :)"
"Lmao yeah I‚Äôm praying that won‚Äôt ever happen to me, I‚Äôve seen pictures from google images about that. And yeah, I‚Äôll definitely wear them especially now that so many people have said nobody really cares. thanks for your advice!"
"Damn. Maybe the orthos give you a really long period of time just to like play it safe? I might try to see what not wearing my retainers as much is like a few more months later, hopefully my teeth won‚Äôt be altered too much if I stop wearing them as much later on"
"I just didn't wear them in public as well. I was told 24/7 but some weeks I just wore them when I went to sleep. Ortho said my teeth were tracking fine every time I went back in so I was like ""meh whatevs""."
You should always feel confident about your smile. You suffer for years and now its time to enjoy it.
wear them while you sleep and you'll be good. I promise you. 8 hours is plenty of time to straighten them back out or even put them back on right when you get home from being out.
"I guess it's because some people for whatever reason wrongly view video games as ""just"" kids' entertainment and nothing more. Yeah. I agree very much with you."
"Idk honestly, I think it‚Äôs ridiculous. We have so many great games in the past 5 plus years that can and will prove that gaming is a legitimate art form in the world of entertainment "
"I get this so much. My mum has always been slightly reluctant of my love for videogames, especially as it took over my love for reading. I know for a fact that if I spent as much time reading today as i do playing videogames and watching videogame related YouTube videos, I'd have gotten a lot less shit from her over the years. 

Incidentally, she was recently  up till 3 am playing a tablet game... Still don't expect to get any less shit even though i manage my ""addictions"" to my computer quite well i think. "
"Marketing, mostly. They are marketed towards children, so people think of them as toys. Modern indie games are leading the charge into convincing people video games can be art."
"Most people's main exposure to 'gaming' these days is in the form of shitty ""free to play"" mobile garbage.  It's no wonder people don't see that as art."
"I feel like that stigma is going away though as gamers get older and older. its becoming much more widely accepted. I hate FortNite but i have to admit that the game has helped the image of gaming a lot. Everyone plays it. Pro athletes, actors etc. and thats good for the gaming community "
"Marketing. If you gonna make money - create f2p online game with microtransactions, without any plot or lor and with huge possibility to replay the game as often as possible. Here comes the billion.

All the most popular games like that. This amount of shitty battle royal clone games, moba games, TCG...

Instead, games with great design or great story or great gameplay - they're not so popular cause they're done once you solved them. Offline single games cannot make money anymore. Well, at least enough money for every fat burger-loving developer."
I think part of it is that it's still seen as a kid's hobby but a lot of it is self selection.  You don't hear as much from people that have a healthy relationship with gaming in terms of time investment than you do gamers that may have a problem balancing their interest in playing video games with other things.
"Yes, I'm low energy today but I'm going to force myself to exercise and then jump in the shower. Hopefully it'll help."
Every day of my life fam. Usually I save that for the weekend and even then I force myself to do at least one hike a weekend. The rest of the time I don't leave my house tho.
I used to a lot but then I mostly cut caffiene from my life. Now when I am lethargic I can drink a Monster or coffee and get a decent jolt to keep me going. I miss having coffee and a rehab every day but its great to be able to use them to stay awake on long trips and such.
yep!! every single sunday. Gotta prepare for the next week of work!
"I'm an insomniac so I get those a lot. I set my bar pretty low for how much productivity I expect from myself each day, but I make sure there is a bar so that I never completely waste a day and I always have at least some semblance of accomplishment by the end of it. It seems a pretty good strategy so far. I think it's helping me sleep a little better so far at least."
"I've heard those things can help, I just want to curl up and melt though haha."
"I find that I‚Äôm having more and more of these, I have to force my arse out at least once a week to buy food, but I just have no will left to move."
"Caffeine sometimes helps me, sometimes not. It‚Äôs hit and miss really and I can‚Äôt really tell when it‚Äôll work. I don‚Äôt think I could give up caffeine in any meaningful capacity as I genuinely like coffee for more than just caffeine."
What do you do for work?
Is it depression? At the worst of mine I didn't even leave my house for work.
Oh yeah I loved my coffee. Would make myself a large mug of espresso 10 times a day. I still drink a lot of decaf but i realize its not 100% free of caffeine. If you cant give up caffeine then I recommend a sativa. I find a good mid afternoon toke will carry be through till the end of the day.
I work for an Anheuser-Busch distributor. I sell beer
"I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if it was at this point, I don‚Äôt have an official diagnosis but I feel like I wouldn‚Äôt be that shocked if it turned out to be that."
"Remind me, what is sativa again?"
"That sounds like a nice job, beer is good, as is any alcohol really, I‚Äôd get drunk now but I did that last night and I honestly can‚Äôt be bothered."
"If you think you need help, then reach out. Don't be like me and fall into an 8 year pit of wasted time:/"
Marijuana. Its the more heady one. 
hahaha yeah I was on vacation for a week and drank every single day so im taking a hiatus. 
"I know I probably ought to, I just don‚Äôt feel too good about it though as I‚Äôve been to therapy a couple of times before and it was only mildly useful. I‚Äôm just not sure I‚Äôm up to shopping around for the right therapist right now."
"I keep meaning to try that stuff but I don‚Äôt know any dealers, it‚Äôs sadly still illegal in my country."
"I‚Äôm worried that if I start drinking to much I‚Äôll develop a dependency, liver damage sounds painful, I don‚Äôt like pain."
Just tread carefully. Don't let yourself fall into any ruts.
Its sorta gray in my area right now. Personally I prefer the CBD oil for the actual medicinal properties for regular use. Then when I am with my friends we will smoke a high THC for entertainment. I have a very addictive personality and most drugs that are addictive in any way I tend to develop a problem with. Marijuana has probably saved my life.
"Sound advice, though maybe a little late. I feel like I have just fallen into a rut for reasons I do not wish to share in public comments."
"I could do with getting baked right now, just some ways to forget, to not be ‚Äúhere‚Äù"
It helps me gain perspective on life. Make the good things more obvious and help me see the silver lining on the bad. Granted it was probably the friends I met smoking that saved my life. It helped me be more social and meet people. I was in a rough place when I started blazing and the people I smoked with were some good people. 
"I want to meet people, but I‚Äôm starting to lose trust in them, seems they just tend to up and abandon me after a while, usually after completely lying about how much they enjoy my company.

Sorry about that... sounds like it helped you though, maybe I‚Äôll try some weed later.... maybe"
"Yeah man for the most part people are terrible. About 1 out of every 100 people Ive blazed with has actually matched bowls or dabs. I have people who were ""friends"" that steal, lie, and talk badly behind my back. I had an ex who told everyone I was a bad person (she said it less politely). I've never had a time so bad that I ""found out who my real friends are"". I like the people I have met playing CounterStrike Source, Rocket League and Overwatch. I add them through steam or battlenet respectively and they are good people. I try to add one person for every person that adds me."
Maybe part of enjoying concert for them is documenting it. Who says they're enjoying it less than you would?
Doesn't bother me;  I can just skip the snap
"I don't have snapchat, I'm just annoyed by all the phones in the air when I'm trying to enjoy the show.  It seems almost everyone today is utterly incapable of living in the moment."
"I never understood Snapchat to begin with. And I agree, dont record all the time at concerts. Not only does it look stupid in general, it also blocks the view for the people behind you.

Though at most concerts I go to, a phone will quickly fall if you hold it in the air. "
I find most snapchat stories to be incredibly dull and boring so I don't see those as any different.  I think they're stupid but it doesn't bother me at all.  I just don't watch them
"Oh, so and so posted a Snapchat story! Let's watch!

*thousands of people screeching*

*a bunch of people nearby singing very off key*

*drums so loud you can't hear the lyrics*

*bass drop*

*screeching intensifies*

And this goes on for several minutes. Yeah, I think I'll skip your story today. "
"Alright, so this happened yesterday at a festival I visited. This rapper, he is singing this lovesong/rap and comes closer to the audience. Then, he made eye contact with one girl and he was pointing at her and asking her hand. This was all filmed and shown on the big displays besides the stage, so everyone could see. So, this girl, the first thing she does: grab out that smartphone and film it. 

That must have been the most ""anti-contact-shield activate"" move I have ever seen.
"
"Not saying they shouldn't document it, but come on, use some common sense and realize that your snapchat friends aren't gonna sit there and watch 100 snaps of a stage that is 500 feet away with music that can barely be heard. "
"At one point, it becomes ""my camera was there"" instead of ""I was there""."
Thank you. 
Why? The fact that they're filming doesn't mean they're any less there. Most people aren't even looking at the screen while filming. They're excited about something and they want to share.
I don't think anyone genuinely enjoys watching stories like these so why people continue to post them is way beyond me
"The only festival I attended almost everyone arrives at day0 afternoon, cause at morning of the first day there were lots of 1-day ticket owners, so the part about tent was already done.

But much more I enjoyed going out to the festival zone and just lay on the grass watching morning bands."
More trouble than they are worth.
"Only ever went to Bonaroo 2015, but my girlfriend and I made the stupid decision of going a couple months after her major back surgery, so she was miserable and I felt bad. The festivals was alright, but I don‚Äôt think it was my scene. I think burning man or something might suit me better. "
"I've only been attending one festival regularly the last few years, and that as a volunteer. The best part of that is definitely when we're done with the last shift which is usually a night shift and just sit around completely exhausted at about four in the morning when the festival grounds are completely empty and just laugh our asses off because of  everyone being in a state. "
"I don‚Äôt go to many music festivals, but the one that I went to over a decade ago was called Locobazooka and it wasn‚Äôt too bad. I napped (probably due to getting second-hand high, if such a term exists) for about an hour in an area that had ‚Äúfaster‚Äù and ‚Äúlouder‚Äù stages.

Food festivals, however..."
hearing passionate musicians play the hearts out all day gets me going
"The bit where I can enjoy them from hundreds or thousands of miles away over the internet. 

I like festivals, but I like them from a distance. "
"I went to Download for the first time this year and it was the greatest weekend of my life, everyone there is so awesome"
My favourite is waking up and hearing bands tuning up and you hear snatches of tunes you recognise and really like. That gets my blood pumping.
Oh man getting all set up and cracking open some beers and sparking some joints and being happy that you made it there. Meeting a ton of people that like the same things as you. Seeing a ton of music for three or four days straight. Getting away from the world for just a few days. Damn I love music festivals.
"Morning bands a brilliant, everyone just hungover in the morning and starting to get pumped for another day!!"
"Yeah, and space in front of stage is not occupied by crowd, so you could stay or lay everywhere and just relax.

Gonna go again next year :)"
If u wanna make it easier on yourself change your diet because diet > exersize 90% of the time
I used to work out a lot (specifically conditioning). As an overweight person with otherwise decent stamina life was good. Unfortunately being overweight has diminishing returns on knees and hips. Nowadays I am content being able to climb a staircase without being winded. If other people want to be fat or in shape I dont really care so long as they are hygienic and not trashy.
"The trick is to exercise every day, even if only for a few minutes, until it becomes so much of an ingrained habit that you start to miss it if you take a day off. I've set myself a 100 day challenge as an effort to kick-start the habit. I haven't set myself a minimum amount of exercise, but every day that I don't work out at all I have to pay $5 into my KiwiSaver account, which is a savings scheme we have in New Zealand that we can't not withdraw from until we buy our first home, migrate to another country, or turn 65. Today is day 16 and I haven't broken my streak yet.

This is unrelated to the topic at hand, but I'm doing identical challenges for meditating and practicing guitar as well. I haven't missed a day on those so far either."
"Yes yes yes! Got this when I was watching Brooklyn 99 and Community with my girlfriend. It‚Äôs an amazing feeling and it‚Äôs been better because with the amount of shows we have lined up has been overwhelming me lol

I loved Over The Garden Wall, probably one of my top cartoons. I especially loved the soundtrack, my favorite song being the Cloud City one that starts with ‚ÄúEverything is nice and fine all the time.‚Äù

Did you like it?"
"That's completely understandable. I hope you enjoyed it!  
  
I've found myself sometimes getting PADS when I'm done with an anime series, because I don't want it to end, but there it is."
"Just sitting here by myself.

Making love? lmao I wish "
"Sounds so much more productive than mine lol (salsbury steak is great btw). I spent saturday night (around 11/12ish) playing the sims until maybe 4ish in the morning, feel asleep around 5 and woke up at like, 9. Since then ive been trying (and failing) to fall back asleep."
"I did the laundry, and in this moment i am in my bed redditing and bored :\"
On holiday in wales but too tired to go down to the beach even though its only about 100 metres away from where I‚Äôm staying.
For me its currently Sunday night
I work in retail and it's my first weekend off of work for the better part of 3 months and today I've done absolutely nothing productive. Listened to Deadmau5's new album and read outside earlier and for the last 2 hours I've been watching Brooklyn Nine Nine in bed. Feels so good to relax.  
:)
Well hopefully your Sims did something productive :)
Holiday in Wales...that's amazing. I'm in a double wide trailor in Appalachia and you're the fanciest person I have ever communicated with. The internet is amazing. 
Well how was your Sunday then?
Oooh. Definitely rest and get caught up on relaxing. 
"haha thanks, i mostly spent my time building houses"
Fancy? Where did you get that idea from?
"Ate a ton of good Chinese food for lunch and decided not to eat dinner, now I'm just hoping Croatia üá≠üá∑ can make a comeback during the game"
Well that is extremely productive!
Maybe fancy isn't the right word. More exotic. 
Ah yes. Soccer is it? I've seen all the craziness going on in the news.
"Oh, I kind of forgot to mention that Im from London so its not like I flew all the way from America to get here"
"Yeah its France 4 Croatia 1,and I'm still hoping Croatia can somehow go beast mode and win"
"Still, it's amazing for me. All I know of London is my 13 year old daughter's obsession with Dan & Phil. "
Well the best of luck to your team. 
Hope you have a good Sunday üëçüåäüåä
"It's all the real you bro. It's just at work you've got a degree of separation. The people don't really matter. They're just coworkers, or even less important, customers, which really start to feel like cattle after a while. 

But out of work these are people you want to accept you. Who you might want to date, initiate friendships with, ect. "
"There is something to that. Somehow being able to speak to those at work (those you see everyday and develop a level of comfort and ease with) is different than with those outside of it. Perhaps it is because within the work environment, you have a control of sorts with where the conversation goes, and as a lot of it is work related or with people you have grown to understand, it isn't as difficult as with those you don't see regularly."
"Multiple personalities, the inner confident you is trying to take over! Don't let it win!... Or do, that might not be so bad. "
I have this is except opposite where as I'm more humble at work
"Everyone wears masks.  We just pick and choose which mask, and where."
Neither of them is the real you. Who's the one behind the different personas?
Totally agree. Their is a certain amount of arms distance type relationships that only matter until you punch the clock. 
"Yo, customer is king at our Pizza Hut, Chad!
You can hand in your Pizza Hut employee discount card tomorrow after your last shift."
That's true. A very large majority of the conversations had at work are going to be about work and thus much easier to navigate. No awkward silence between thoughts of how to maintain said conversation as you stumble through it like outside of work. Excellent point!
Haha!! Maybe not to that degree but it does definitely feel mostly separate from my at-home personality.
I seem to start out like that but after the first hour or so I seem to lose that filter. 
"How very ""Art of War"" of you lol!!"

Rubbing alcohol may get it out.

"Gonna try later tonight, thanks"
"You don't pick a hobby, a hobby picks you "
You just find a thing that intrigues you and when you try to put it down you find yourself going back to it more and more.
"It just happens. One random youtube video is all it takes. It's much like love really. You just know when you've found ""the"" hobby (or when you still enjoy it 2 years later). All your free time spent on your hobby (and money too). It'll find you. Now go forth and explore all the hobbies there is! :)"
"I don't think this is unusual at all and the majority of folks do this.  Hobbies are ""fun"" because we enjoy them at our leisure hop in and out of them and don't really dedicate our focus to it.  The moment you obsess over something you put a lot of passion and drive into it (whether it be drawing, running, cooking etc) its going to require money, time, dedication and energy. You'll fail and get frustrated.  Youll have to do those things more frequently even if you're not really ""feeling"" it.

I mean I'm sure there are folks out there that are just motivated to stick with something all the time and don't think twice about it but thats definitely not me and I havent met many who are like that.

My recommendation if you really do want to stick with something is to make more of a pattern to work or try something every day.  Read an article on whatever you're learning or doing - practice every day on whatever it is you're interested in even when you're not all that excited about it.  You wont always be excited about something but creating that repetition in your schedule and doing something every day is key to motivating yourself further.

That being said thats do as I say not as I do because I still struggle with that even now."
"for me, it was being irregularly social in University and trying out different clubs and organisations. I started Kick boxing and have been doing it almost every day for 5 years.   


I would say have an open mind, don't be afraid to fail/embarrass yourself. Be humble and willing to learn even when you do actually become great at something."
"This might sound crazy. But personally I don't think you pick a hobby, it picks you. Our brains are strange things but I think that what we enjoy, what sets of those chemicals that make us feel good, is all 'pre-installed' in our brains. 

You gotta try all different things and see what really brings you joy. I did all sorts from playing football and basketball to reading comics and playing video games. I think I now realise my main hobbies are  gaming and playing bass. 

As a side note, I think you need to have at least two hobbies. One to keep you in shape (sports, running, weightlifting etc.) and one that gives you a creative output. Recently I tried weightlifting but it wasn't for me, I might give running / hiking a try!  "
I am kind of like that to a degree but I don't think that it's so much that everything fascinates you than the opposite.  There's nothing interesting enough that you'd focus on it preferentially to everything else.
"Whatever appeals to you. No one said you have to be good at something, you just have to enjoy it. I'm mediocre at muay thai and my fly tying is like a kid got loose with pipe cleaners, hooks, and sparkly thread. Oh well. I have fun doing it so I haven't quit., but I also don't obsess or make them a priority. Whenever I have down time is when I get into something. Right now I'm debating on what instrument I want to start."
"That‚Äôs the thing, I feel like I‚Äôm intrigued by too many things. Life is a little hectic right now, maybe I‚Äôll feel more at ease once I have time to do some of my old hobbies "
"I really enjoy drumming, drawing, working on vehicles, and mma fighting. But it seems like I‚Äôll get tired of one and quit completely for a period of time and eventually go back. All the time I wasted not doing one of them just seems to set me back another step. Maybe you‚Äôre right, maybe I haven‚Äôt found ‚Äúthe one‚Äù so to speak "
"Beautifully put! I guess maybe I have been imagining ‚Äúhobbies‚Äù to be something you could eventually make a living out of (not saying it‚Äôs impossible, just not plausible for most). You make a good point, I‚Äôve always heard anything turns into a job eventually. 

That‚Äôs true too, I just feel like I know a lot people that are really good at a certain thing.

Very good idea! I tend to struggle with that myself. I have good intentions, but I don‚Äôt typically follow through for very long. Maybe I‚Äôm just lazy..."
"I would love to kickbox! I used to cage fight, and unfortunately there‚Äôs not a good school anywhere near me.  I sometimes wish I lived in a bigger city for the amenities 

Thank you for your input! I will definitely try to use your advice to better myself "
"I agree with that, and I do enjoy a lot of things. I just think maybe my main problem is time management coupled with the fact that life is busy at times. But yes, I think humans are definitely predisposed to be attracted to certain things. 

I‚Äôm glad you have found your niche! Maybe I‚Äôm just in a slump at the moment...

I totally agree with that!! I think that‚Äôs a big reason people are miserable, because they are not in the shape they want to be in and have no drive therefore feel no real meaning. "
You lack time to focus on one thing then. I get that at times.
"I feel were all pretty lazy when push comes to shove so I personally dont feel you are - you're just human.  Couple that with the fact that were now the most connected we've ever been in society and we have tons of information constantly bombarding us its not surprising we feel so drained and exhausted and not able to focus.

I really want to focus on some board game design or videogame design.  I'd love to work on my art more but the reality is Im at the point where I'd have to actually practice, I'd have to push myself and challenge myself to dedicate a lot of focus instead of schmoozing around online wasting my time.  With work being demanding and having just moved and now have to clean and take care of the new house ....I really WANT to work on my hobbies but ...yeah, much like you just feeling lazy.

I hope you find that hobby that really clicks with you but if you don't - understand that you're definitely not alone - were all fighting for that energy to really chase that dream.
"
"Unfortunately I'm often miserable (depression is a bitch) but I keep up with the things I enjoy and it can help fight off that pain momentarily. 

I hope you find ya thing man."
Yeah that‚Äôs it! Maybe that‚Äôs the point I should focus on instead of worrying about finding something new 
"That‚Äôs reassuring that I‚Äôm not the only one. I actually read something about that not long ago. It was about how our brain can‚Äôt retain nearly as much information as we receive daily. I should probably shut my phone off at certain times during the day. 

That sounds interesting, I wanted to create a board game too actually! I‚Äôm in the same boat, I just got a drawing tablet and have only gotten to use it maybe three times. I hope you can soon get back into your hobbies and the things you want to do 

Thank you, I wish the same for you as well! Maybe it‚Äôs all about timing. As long as the desire is there, I feel like we can make things happen when it‚Äôs supposed to"
"Damn that‚Äôs too bad! I hope it gets better for you for good! 

Thank you, I appreciate it!"
"Perhaps you have to sit and evaluate how much joy you get from each hobby, find the one that gives you maximum joy and do that one. Cut out all the excess fat."
"Video Games
Reading
Needle Felting
And I Glove.

I‚Äôm fairly basic haha"
I watch Japanese Women's Wrestling.
"Longboarding - it's super fun, you can use it as a mean of transportation or learn cool tricks and the community is extremely friendly and welcoming and willing to help you learn

Photography - i am not good but i like taking pictures of things i find interesting or pretty. It's fun because at one point you realise you can find interesting stuff almost anywhere.

Cooking - so. fun. Especially if you don't have all ingredients for something and just make up your own variations and  recipes. The best thing - you get to eat what you've made so it's almost an immediate gratification type of thing."
"I enjoy reading and writing, though I‚Äôm not very good at the latter :) I also play soccer with my friends occasionally"
[deleted]
"I'm just really into brewing and drinking tea, which to me is worthwhile to put time and energy into along with a bit of money :P"
"Gardening, painting, watercolor, going for walks, camping, biking, writing letters to family, knitting, baking or cooking. "
"Mostly power lifting, video games, cross stitch, and painting (I'm not particularly artistic, so it's usually just abstract stuff)...  I couldn't find any wall decor I liked, so I made my own. "
"I play guitar and ukulele, sometimes I draw or paint. I have pets so taking the dogs for rides or to the dog park is good, and spending time with my cats. I also listen to podcasts, lectures, and speeches on YouTube, though I often do that while doing other things. And I've been reading a lot of self-help books and typically take notes on them. Also audio books are good. And I'm a photographer, so I take a lot of pictures of nature, landscapes, animals, etc. I also write. I try to do critical writing and analysis on myself - my thoughts, beliefs, and actions. "
"I like playing video games, watching anime, writing and reading fanfiction. I also like running. I also enjoy running. There was a big 10K race on the 4th of July here that I ran in. It was a blast."
"Target archery which developed into target archery and hunting.   Motorcycles, video games.  Science fiction / fantasy reading and audiobooks.   "
"Cooking as a career/hobby (best of both worlds there), gaming, surfing, writing and gardening. "
"I'm teaching myself guitar, building an arcade cabinet (potentially the first of many), and I'm starting to treat gaming as more of a proper hobby too. I'm building a new gaming PC this week and I want to start playing games more competitively and maybe doing some streaming."
"I play a lot of D&D/Pathfinder. 

So much fun. "
"I build PCs, play video games, and listen to music. I also teach others to build PCs through Discord... oh and I run."
"> And I Glove

What does that mean?"
Can agree and confirm how fun cooking is! 
"Oh that‚Äôs true! I‚Äôm sure baking and cooking go hand in hand, maybe I‚Äôll look into something like that! Any recipes you recommend?"
Who are you addressing with this question?
"I recently began learning about the process of brewing coffee, and it‚Äôs very extensive. I can imagine brewing tea is similar in that aspect! They can be expensive hobbies for sure!"
I should definitely try going to the gym as a hobby. Although I don‚Äôt think I would be very good at power lifting. Working out is such a wonderful hobby for some people!
"I‚Äôve always wanted to learn how to play an instrument but I never knew how to begin learning. Also, I love podcasts! What are some do your favorites? I definitely need some new ones to listen to. "
Oh those all sound fun! I have recently started playing fortnite and want to start working out!
Recommend something good to me from the sci fi/fantasy genre if you don't mind. I'm not sure what to read next. 
"Surfing sounds like a lot of fun, do you have any tips for someone who has never surfed before that may want to try it?"
"It‚Äôs a flow art, you wear gloves with led lights on the tips of your fingers and equalize music with your fingers. It‚Äôs usually to edm music.

Sounds dumb in writing, I know haha.
You can look it up on YouTube! (emazing lights) "
"Hmm i really like baked chicken wings (works with thighs as well) marinated in soy sauce and honey and sprinkled with sesame.

But you can experiment with marinade. The past week i cooked some steaks in a mix of red win–µ, vodka, honey, black pepper, onion, garlic, some spices - basically what I had handy. Turned marvelous. "
"Me maybe? I mentioned video games.

I play a little of everything, but I prefer RPGs. Turn based JRPGs mainly. Final Fantasy being my favorite series. I also love story driven FPS and survival horror. "
Yea for sure pretty similar in some aspects although I can usually drink a lot more tea than coffee. Sort of why its my drink of choice and well I have a lot of teas to get through now.
"There are self-teaching books as well as videos on YouTube to help you begin learning an instrument, if you don't want to pay for an actual instructor. I taught myself how to play just by using books and watching videos and repeating what I hear.
I really enjoy anything with Jordan Peterson. He has tons of YouTube videos as well as a few podcast channels. And Alan Watts has both. There's also Dan Carlin's Hardcore History. One I listen to for fun is the Ricky Gervais podcast. I listen to it on YouTube. It's an older one, but it cracks me up."
Well with the name drizzt I‚Äôm guessing you‚Äôre well read on r a Salvatore.    Joshua dalzelle‚Äôs omega rising and warship series are great and what I‚Äôve been reading.   And Jonathan Maberry‚Äôs- joe ledger series are also very good 
"Don't worry about falling. Everyone does it, and it's nothing to be ashamed of. Get on a board, learn to lay on it right (you want to be centered enough to where the nose or the tail won't dip into the water). Then when you catch a wave, you're basically going to do a push up with your upper body and sweep your feet up under you to a crouching position. You don't want to stand erect, stay crouched. 

Honestly it's not hard, just takes practice. And the practice is fun too. The only thing surfers I know don't like are wave hogs and when you try to get in front of them when they catch a wave. "
"Somethings are hard to explain in text form. Right there with you, buddy. I have the same trouble. How does one equalize the music with the gloves? This seems like some future shit. Cool hobby."
"Alright, much appreciated. "
"I love it. I have severe social anxiety and can‚Äôt dance worth a shit so it‚Äôs nice being able to express myself and have others enjoy it. 
You roll your fingers, and do some minor tutting.

Have you read the war of the spider queen series?
"Dude, thats looks pretty badass. This guy clearly practices a lot. Glad you found an interesting way to express yourself. I have a friend with bad social anxiety at times. She says its constant paranoia, like people are looking at you and judging. Sounds horrible."
"Yep yep. Quite enjoyed it. I've been taking a break from the D&D universe for a bit, I'll never give it up though. Been going back through the Dune series and the Midkemia series lately, that's why I wanted a new author to check out. "
"Thanks! I think so too. Haha yeah, he‚Äôs sponsored so he actually gets paid for it. Maybe one day I‚Äôll be that lucky! 

It‚Äôs hell, I seem to be getting better with it as I get older and gain more self worth. Plus I‚Äôm around far more positive people than I surrounded myself with in the past, so that helps. "
"When I took a break from forgotten realms I read a lot of zombie apocalypse stuff.  Joe mckinney, rachel auckes, James cook.   Also.  Predator and aliens books.    Or if your a gamer... lots of halo books available.    And Karen Travis has a bunch of books that fill in the story between each gears of war game.   "
"Maybe. Keep refining your stuff down to a fine edge.

My friend had precisely one other friend who was a fucking boring poisonous scumbag lying bitch (i feel very strongly about her, CAN YOU TELL?????). She bolstered her self esteem by putting my friend down. Eventually she put friend down enough that she started to believe the bullshit. If you believe you are nothing for long enough eventually you become nothing. You are fucking Ric Flair. Coolest guy ever. You have to believe that shit. Everyday i look in my mirror and say to myself ""You are a fucking badass."". Everyday."
"I should read some Halo. I play Destiny all the time, yet I've never touched any Halo game even though same developer. The Diablo series was good, Nephalem or something I think. "
"Yep. I had the exact same friend. I cut her out of the picture completely almost six years ago, and things have been so much better. I honestly think she was a sociopath. I agree with you 100%, positive thinking helps a lot more than people give it credit. 

I‚Äôm going to stand in the mirror and WOOOO every morning nowüòÇ thanks! "
When you are that friendship i imagine you convince yourself that this is the only friend you will ever have and why would anyone want to talk to a loser like me and so on but the truth of the matter is you are The Nature Boooy one limousine ridin jet flyin son of a gun WHOOOOOOOOO. 
Happy Birthday! Hope you live to see many many more. 
"Happy birthday!

If you want to learn portugese or russian, why don't you try to find a movie (with subtitles of course) in that language to watch. It might be a good way to kinda kick start that interest. Not the most birthday-ish thing to do, but it is not so common."

Happy birthday!
Many thanks to you! Let's make today a great day 
"After what they did to Teen Titans, I've given up on all cartoon reboots. My younger siblings asked me to show them more  of ""my"" Teen Titans and I told them to call it the real Teen Titans from now on. "
"I think they did duck tales justice - I only watched the first episode but it felt pretty tried and true to the original while also adding new aspects that made it more modern.  Voice actors were great - though I'm biased because I love Kate Micucci, Ben Schwartz, Danny Pudi, David Tennat and Jim Rash.

When push comes to shove the show is meant for us to put it on for our children because we have rose tinted glasses of nostalgia and its really never going to hold up to how much we loved it."
"Honestly I like the new duck tales. I watched a few episodes, and I found it funny and cute. Yeah it‚Äôs not the original, but the characters are still pretty likable and it‚Äôs fun to watch"
https://youtu.be/0-LNgU4e1rE
I watched the trailer for it and man they really fucked up their voices didn't they?  Had the same reaction to the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles getting rebooted as well for different reasons.
"I've found a lot of people feel that way about the teen titans. For me I was in my late teens early twenties when the original/more serious one was aired, so I never really watched it. Plus the new one was a nice upgrade when my daughter started watching that instead of treehouse. The jokes and writing style were at least slightly entertaining for me as well, in comparison to Dora and Max and Ruby that is. Haha"
"Yeah, the voices is one of the things I didn't like about the trailer. That, and the square heads. I'm pleased they didn't change the theme song though. I was not aware it was already released. I will have to check it out.

You're absolutely right about that. Here's hoping for the best and that my kid enjoys it, so that we can watch it weekend mornings. Share a new nostalgic moment. :) "
That's great news. Thanks for your input. 
"After watching one of the episodes the voices are not as bad as I originally thought. It seemed like the classic Donald Duck sound was gone, but it's there. It's subtle, but there still.

Are we talking the cartoon TMMT or the movies? "
" I still get cranky quite a bit ""really - they're rebooting *that?*"" haha - I try my best to remain impartial because I know its not for me but ...well, my wife calls me a curmudgeon for good reasons lol.

If you haven't seen it I really recommend Gravity Falls - had a lot of fun with that kids show even as an adult!"
"Haha, indeed. We are absolutely on the same page there.

Thanks for the recommendation kind stranger, we will look into that. "

"40 year old Black Male here. I feel you as far as the feelings that some on here tend to express when such things are revealed, but I try my best to not allow that to overshadow those that view me as a normal human being.  And I LOVE the fact that some came to your aid when you are in need.  That really warms my heart.

I've met a few redittors in real life when Alexis came here during a meetup and man, it was great meeting and talking to all of them.  A stark contrast to the image of the type of person that is often by many on this site.

"I‚Äôve been here 8, I‚Äôm Hispanic, in my 30s. Lately I‚Äôve just been noticing that since it‚Äôs gotten more popular I‚Äôm seeing a lot of comments that I hadn‚Äôt seen here. Stuff that brought me a bit down, racism etc, but this post made me feel so much better. To know there are still a good amount of good here and that it‚Äôs helped contribute a whole new person to your life that you care about is really awesome. üëåüèΩ"
That's an amazing story! So glad you had such great experiences! 
"Six years now, feels really weird. 

I was in the 12th grade when I made this account, I remember the feeling of impending doom when submitting comments/posts and fearing downvotes haha... it felt like I needed peoples approval on here every time and now that im older it's funny to think about. 

This may sound crazy but I feel it's kinda improved my thinking in a way. Coming up with witty things to say in comments, reading articles I wouldn't bother to read in a high school library, TIL's, etc. 

This website is both a blessing and a curse really. But if it shut down tomorrow I think an addiction would be cured. "
"It's always great when you can find someone to lend a hand when you need it.  I hope the next 10 years goes well for you and that you can help others as you have been helped yourself.  

If everyone showed a little kindness and paid it forward a bit at a time the whole world would be a better place.  Before I found this subreddit I would have assumed that the internet was home to the worst people on Earth.  I've spent a few days here, reading and responding and it helps to keep me optimistic.  

When you're in the worst places, it's hard to see the light, but once you get out and you adjust to the brighter conditions, you start to see just how bleak the place you were in really was.

Once again, glad to hear you've gotten yourself into the light.  üòé"
Good for you. I too check this site everyday.
"I'm all for anonymity and privacy.  

But I'd also like to thank all those who haven't deleted informative comments/posts for someone else to stumble upon. I have posts still bookmarked from when I first started lurking ~8 years ago. Been so helpful throughout the time I've been here."
"Racism is common unfortunately. The political climate has changed and it might seem like it‚Äôs behind us as people learn and being a racist gets you more and more alienated- At the same time that‚Äôs an entire alienated class forming- And over the years they‚Äôve gotten quite big. Shit, they might‚Äôve elected our president.

And as the site balloons in users that means there‚Äôs an influx of both good and bad. I casually browsed through your post history. A lot of people will tell you that you‚Äôre victimizing yourself, You‚Äôre overstating how hard it is to be you, Black people don‚Äôt have it harder than others and bullshit drivel followed by bullshit drivel.

Again, That‚Äôs bullshit. Being black in the US is certainly significantly harder than being white."

"I am having one of those nights right now...

Thanks for giving me a little light."
"Hey, thanks for sharing your story. Glad Reddit was there for you when you most needed it, at least!

I've been around here for 12 years now and have really seen the best and worst ofwhat it can be for people... nothing huge that's affected me directly like this, though, although I've helped a fair few people where I can in my time!

But I actually have a question for you as the history of Reddit is often on my mind. The people you describe at the start of your post, and the response you get to who you are... do you think that has changed over time here, and got better/worse in any ways?

I'd imagine from 10 years ago it has got worse, as from what I've seen the early adopters were mostly interested in geeky tech stuff... and politics and other stuff didn't seem to pop up so often. I think the biggest shift in demographics and content of Reddit must have been from when Digg ""died"" and there was a mass exodus to here. But I'm wondering if your experience might be different assuming you ever revealed any of these things to anyone way back then too?"
"So the reason your words hit me so hard wasn't just because I've been abused but it also that innocence and optimism and basic goodness and faith in humanity that allowed you to reach out and reinvent yourself.  

I so feel you and thank you. I'm just starting to see the light. 

It's crazy the thing that dragged me from hell was OK Cupid of all things. 

I'd escaped and ended up homeless and a friend gave me a place to stay. But I was broke and a mess. I finally decided to start dating, still haven't found a relationship but....... 

I met one nice guy after another. Didn't expect a thing. Helped me out. Gave me work. Introduced me to people. It seemed they were all down to help single moms no strings attached because we're responsible and work hard. God this one guy/now friend kept giving us tickets to summer camps for my kids and I since he'd change his mind and went elsewhere. And invited my kids and I to this sweet private festival that we still go to every year. It was such a wacky time. 

Ok Cupid got me where I am today. 

Haven't thought of that in years. "
OMG revealing you're female on Reddit is the WORST so I completely understand you only letting bits of your identity out at any one time...! Sometimes I really do wonder why I'm on this bloody website ;)
"Late 20s white male here, thank you for sharing your story with us and thank you for giving me a little perspective during a difficult time for me.  It made me realize that things are not nearly as bad as I see them in my own life and if there ever is a time that it gets too overwhelming, there are still good people out there willing to help.  "
"No one actually cares what you are. Small, angry people will find anything to latch onto and attack. If you were a 20 year old ripped Asian man they'd call you wannabe Bruce Lee."
"Fat Hispanic woman here... I feel your pain. But hey, it‚Äôs got enough positivity here to outweigh the idiots, so I‚Äôll stick around too. I‚Äôm only a little ways behind you officially, but about the same unofficially. I only made an account cause they required one to do the second secret Santa. I‚Äôd done the first, and the next year they were required at least a month old reddit account, so I made one."
"Wow, this is so heartwarming. The power of social media continually surprises me. I‚Äôm so glad your life improved for the better. *hugs*

And after being on Reddit for ten years, I‚Äôm sure you know this but.. you owe us a picture of your fur baby!! You know we love them!!"
"Congrats, and next time I'm able to help someone here in Reddit, I will do so in honor of you. "
"<3

I agree. People are a-holes. I post in support forums but trolls follow me around and down vote me. It can be devastating times to need support and to not receive any or only tons of snarky comments.

I‚Äôm glad you found happiness and strength and that people came through for you when you needed it."
"Impossible! You can‚Äôt be a middle aged black woman! Everyone on here is 19-25, white, male, middle class and majoring in STEM!"
"10 years, wow! I didn't even know Reddit was that old. Amazing story, and I'm starting to check this subreddit every day, too. It's a great community that I discovered last week."
WHOLESOME
"20, white male here. 10 years? That‚Äôs amazing! It‚Äôs a shame people would give you flak for anything you‚Äôve said. Maybe if you beat babies and fight adorable animals, but they should never say anything down to you about those 3 things. So here is a FUCK YOU to everyone who has ever said hurtful things to you on this site. Hope you get another 10 years out of this glorious site. Happy cake day. "
Good luck in all your endeavors stranger salam alaikum.
"Race and sex seem to be much more of an *issue*(?) in America, people don't seem to give much of a shit here. "
Happy cake day! It‚Äôs my cake day too!
"Been here 1 year today, have been on daily (internet access permitting) as well!"
"Wow, thank you for sharing your story with us!

Like yourself, I belong to a number of marginalized groups. It is tough at times and -just like you- I see some nasty vitriol (casual racism, blatant racism, xenophobia, homophobia, transphobia, ageism, etc.) on the internet regarding all of the things that I am. I've recently learned not to get involved in battles with these ""jackwagons"" (haha) and I feel better about it for the most part.

I am always pleasantly surprised by the kindness of some people and I'm infinitely grateful that such people exist and strive to make their little corner of the world a better place. I'm so very glad that these people also use Reddit!"
"I wanted to say thank you for your story. I‚Äôm a white woman approaching my 30‚Äôs. I had reached a low point (teen mom but got a good job then things came crashing down, lost home, vehicle, negative in bank, etc) and had no idea what to do. I have to thank Reddit for helping me in small ways. From being encouraged to go back to school (I graduate in December with a BBA!), watch my budget (Dave Ramsey FTW), and work on my credit score (it‚Äôs at 665 right now and moving in the right direction), my life has dramatically changed. We now own two vehicles. The only debt we have are my student loans. And we have some money in the savings (not a lot but still some) and a credit card that I have kept a 5% utilization rate on for 6 months. That‚Äôs a DRASTIC change from the young girl who let herself get a $25k brand new car with $550 monthly payments and maxed out credit cards making only $12 an hour. I honestly have to thank Reddit for help and all the good subs helping me in the right direction.  Again I‚Äôm not where I wanna be budget wise (spend a lot on eating out) but I‚Äôm getting there. 

I do think it‚Äôs funny how everyone (even myself) assumes redditors are white males. We have such a wonderful group of people ranging across all kinds of races,sexes,sexual orientation, socioeconomic statuses,etc. I see some shitty comments that are racist, sexist, or talking about how ugly or fat someone is but I see a whole lot more positive comments. I see a lot of people doing good and that keeps me going and reminds me to be a better person. 

I‚Äôve been on Reddit for a few years now, probably about 4 (I had a previous username) and hope to still be on here a few years from now. I don‚Äôt like Facebook bc people are always posting things that just don‚Äôt matter. I like Reddit bc I can talk to an almost unlimited amount of people about subjects I care about. 

I love that you are a middle aged black woman. You are one of the reasons I use this site. Thank you for your post today! "
"I'm so happy that you're in a better place now!

Reddit had a similar effect on me.  I was in a *very* dark place, and it was because of a bunch of empathetic redditors that I decided, on a whim, to go to therapy.  Five years later, I'm basically a different person.

I don't think I'll ever forget the handful of comments that led me to the path I'm on.  I checked recently, and the user who started it all deleted his account.  Would've been great to PM him."
love you. thank you for being a part of reddit.
This is Wholesome Content
"Amazing. Lately I am feeling extremely alone in this world but seeing your post reminds me that I am not. There are good people. Thank you, happy to hear you are doing that much better. There is hope."
I was still learning my times table 10 years ago aha
Thanks for pulling back the curtain a bit on your life. Proud of you for finding the strength to leave that unfortunate situation in your life. No one should ever have to face that. Best of luck to you in the future!

Love your story. Thank you for sharing.
"I just started posting on Reddit. I couldn‚Äôt agree more, there are so many amazing people here. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è much love."
"I have been here 12 years now, visiting Reddit nearly every day, and I have to say I am a better person for it. The community has been my teacher and mentor, it has been there for me when I have needed it, and it's been there to laugh with. The pseudonymity here means I don't get judged for who I am or what I look like, it's only my words that count."
This made me cry. This is by far the best thing I‚Äôve seen on Reddit for a very long time. I‚Äôm so happy for you and I admire your strength and your sensitivity. Kind of made my day!
"Beautiful story, thank you for sharing "
that's amazing
"I had to check the username to make sure this wasn't my post!

I too am a black female who is ""old"" by reddit terms (37) and I too have been on reddit for a while. I also left my abusive relationship (mine was just emotional, not physical) by just piling my cat, self, and whatever I could (thank Zeus for hatchbacks) into my car one night and driving away. And I too have felt the sting of trying to defend what I am to the circlejerk of reddit mentality. 

That shit gets tiring after a while.

Sometimes what people say here really gets me, makes me feel like less of a human. I've quit and come back multiple times. At this point I just assume everyone I meet irl is just like people here, so I keep to myself rather than have someone spew crap at me. 

But anyways I came here to say hi, and i'm glad you got free from your terrible situation and am now free and happy. To have such support from the reddit community that you've had is amazing. I wish you the absolute best in your life. "
That story was beautiful. What a twist :-D

"heart warming story of personal inner strength and perserverance.  I would be curios to know what all you have in your Reddit ""saved"" folder and what of those saved are your favorite? you inspire."
"I've been on Reddit for just over a year now and I love it so much. You're right, there are a lot of toxic people and toxic communities here, but you'll always be the better person for not letting them get to you."
"Five Year Redditor here. This is one of the best posts I‚Äôve ever seen. Not just on casual conversation, but all of Reddit.

Thank you for sharing your story!!!"
"From another middle aged woman that‚Äôs been here about a year less than you if I count my old account....I‚Äôm so glad you‚Äôre in a better place now.  Congratulations!  I hope things continue to look up for you and that you‚Äôre around here for many more years of ...weird memes and shitposts and Reddit celebrity scandals.  You know, business as usual. "
"This is such a wholesome story üòÑI'm glad that you took the time out of your day to showcase the bright side of reddit instead of letting all the negativity on this site weigh you down. Have a great day, everyone who reads this comment!"
"This is beautiful. Coming from 4chan many years ago, reddit culture is so loving and supportive. Stories like this prove that. Thank you for posting and I am proud of you for being so strong, stranger. Thank you for posting!"
How the hell did you get your flair I love it
"I'm sorry to hear about your circumstances, thank you for posting! I'm glad things have taken a turn for you. Keep on reading on Reddit!"
Aww damn man I'm crying now wow.
Love your story. Made me feel good about humanity thank you for that. 
Happy 10th cake day! This is a beautiful story.
I got chills from this. What a wild ride! Hope the next 10 are even better than the last.
That's the best thing I've read on here all day! Happy 10 years and thank you for sharing a bit of your story.
Do you remember the Jenny saga?
Oh I love this! You are amazing
"I think the toxicity is more visible now, but any of us revealing those aspects of ourselves online brings out the worst because it gives them any sort of a target."
"Thank you for sharing! I just recently started redditing, and there are so many posts which are just so heart warming and beautiful, that it gives me hope that there are actually a lot of people who are nice. Thank you. Sorry for what you had to go through, but I am proud for you as to where you are now! Have a good day!"
"I hope for every one negative comment, you've had at least a thousand good exchanges. . "
"That gave me chills! I like the anonymity of Reddit because the only way to try to guess where someone is from or what they look like is by how they type out their posts. I saw a quote on here earlier today from a blind guy that said a perk of being blind there is no race. Everyone is the same, and Reddit is kinda like that. I mostly read comments in wholesome subs but it sucks people have treated you shittily because they had a problem with something you physically can‚Äôt control. There are bad people out there, but this place also shows you all the good:)

I love Reddit. Also, good for you for getting out before it was too late! My sister got out and had been married for 2 years to someone infinitely better now:) best of luck to you!!! "
Fuck you made me cry. Wow. Been there. 
"That was really nice to read :)

Reddit is always the place I come to if I need advice or even just some words of encouragement... for some reason, I trust the words of strangers more than I trust the words of my friends. It's a good community!"
"I teared up, what a beautiful story. Thanks for sharing"
"Good job getting out of that horrible situation OP, it's rough. Hope you have a great life! "
"More power to you, girl"
"I'm very very new to Reddit, but I came here because it seemed like I finally found a place to be myself and would be accepted by total strangers. Reading your story inspires me that maybe I was right :)"
That's so great! Thank you for sharing. People are so lovely!!
"Great story.

You are so strong to walk out of an abusive relationship. You literally don't have time for that kind of experience.

You're doing great for a 25-year-old!

Keep on keeping on sis!
"Thanks for sharing this post, I really enjoyed reading that."
"*hi five!*

I haven't had as good of a relationship with reddit, and will be leaving it slowly soon, but I'm glad the are stories like yours out there."
Wow. This is such a heartening story! Much power to you and all the Redditors!
Aloha and wish you well from a Chinese-Australian. Sounds like things will stay bright and lit for you. All the best!
Thank you for sharing and reminding me why I still do love reddit. You have a good hand at story telling btw.

"Middle aged women unite! :) 
Great post. I've been on here over ten years also and I remember the Digg exodus. We thought we'd been flooded. Ha! I don't know what the numbers were then but I'm sure it was a fraction of what they are now. Reddit has grown exponentially.
Reddit has changed a lot, and not for the better, but even with the kindness diluted it's still better than most sites out there. Years ago I was desperate to save a blind cat that had been dumped in the shelter I volunteered in. I asked reddit for help and many people donated towards his medical bills. I ended up adopting that cat and although he's gone now I will always be grateful to reddit for their kindness when I needed it. I have seen reddit come together to do great things and help so many people (and animals!). There is a contingent of people whose mission seems to be making other people miserable, but so far they are still in the minority. I can come on here feeling alone, desperate and miserable, and find something to make me smile. 
Thank you for sharing your story. "
‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è it‚Äôs the folks that genuinely want to connect who make it so worth it! And screw those folks who take your identity to prove their opinions. That is YOUR privilege to make! I love it here and people like you are what make it so great.

I love being reminded that not everyone on here is a 28-year-old white guy. 
"I used to feel a sense of community on Reddit, but over the years (6 since I created an account, but about 8 since I started lurking) it feels like it's becoming more... Disingenuous. 

When resdit was younger there were more creators and innovators, more people having casual conversations and supporting each other. Now it feels like everyone is sharing replays of sports or TV shows or streamers or celebrities or politicians. Its the spectacle.

I know there are good people among us (look for the helpers!) but our normal tone is getting lost in the internet shouting match. I miss the sense of community, but also, I am part of the reason it is disappearing, because I don't post enough anymore; I don't engage.

I loved reading your story. it makes me so happy that Reddit, our community, has changed your life so dramatically. Thank you for sharing!

You and I may have nothing in common at all, but on reddit, we‚Äôre on the exact same field, and can discuss things like friends. Sucks that some people can‚Äôt handle that, but I think it‚Äôs a net good thing"

"You described Reddit and why we keep coming back despite it's flaws. Well said!  

Glad you escaped that shitty situation. "
"Hello fellow old black lady on Reddit. This place can be a cesspool, ya?

But also mainly good if you curate what you subscribe to, which I'm assuming you've gathered after a decade. I just checked my profile, and holy gods, I've been here for 6 years myself. Though to be fair, only posted for about half of that.

Anywho, glad you're around. Glad your life has found its groove. Be well, my sister. ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
"Nearly 40, white woman from UK. I've been lurking on reddit for years reading stuff...but finally joined a week or so ago. I'm so glad you had people to help you when you needed it. Xx"
This is just wonderful and sums up Reddit perfectly. 
"You are incredible! Being a black woman myself, I've always had fear or revealing it with fear of getting mean and hurtful comments "
"Three of the biggest subs are TwoX, BPT, and LSC. I assumed people were well represented on Reddit. It never crossed my mind that Reddit is made up of 20 something white dudes.

Sometimes I think the only privilege is that some people are not constantly thinking about race. One of the most educated demographics in America is black woman these days. You can‚Äôt tell on Reddit who is what race. Not unless their manner with commenting is exaggerated and even then it could be someone pretending to be something they are not.

I think Reddit attracts a pretty diverse crowd. It is leading the way in how powerful anonymity can be for good and bad. 

The only people that I think I can identify regularly are the teenagers. That is only because their posting history gives them away. 

I am a man in his 40s that is both proud to be masculine and white. Not proud so much in the pigmentation of the skin, but proud in the inheritancy of being white. Proud of the culture. I am 70% Norwegian, 20 %Irish, and 10 % German. In my view there is much good to be proud of. 

Maybe the only other privilege I see in myself is the privilege of not being afraid of much, but in being afraid of little. The things I am afraid of are wether or not I can pay for my kids college, help my kids with buying their first car, or helping them with a down payment on their first house. I am afraid of failure.

None of that means that I do not see the remarkableness in other races, cultures, or genders. 

I have three daughters...only daughters. When I look at them I don‚Äôt see weakness...I see strength. I don‚Äôt know why so many women feel so weak. Where did that come from? I often read TwoX and I literally want to vomit at the weakness. I don‚Äôt see my daughters in TwoX. I hope they never associate themselves with weakness. That they never look at being a victim to the many ways that life can try and shit on you.

I think it is sad that you have to feel vulnerable for saying that you are a black middle aged woman. Some of the most powerful people I have met in my life are black middle aged women. 

I think that I would roll over in my grave if one of my daughters ever opened up about being vulnerable for being a middle aged woman. Hell no...your father was a warrior, your ancestors were warriors. You are the result of thousands upon thousands and even millions of years of evolution that have perfected you to survive the worst the world can dish out. Hell no! 

Black middle-aged woman....you need to hold your head up high. Your ancestors were fighters. I am sure your parents were fighters. You are the result of thousands of years of human evolution that perfected you to survive. You won the lottery of existence. 

Feeling vulnerable for who and what you are...fuck that

"This post has inspired more people than a hateful one could ever dream of. Keep up the good work, from the UK."
"16 year old girl here, seen the worst of reddit sometimes, but every single day I also see the best. I seriously love this massive community "
I've said it all along. There needs to be an adult reddit. There is nothing anybody loves to do more then to correct someone on the internet who appears to be.... dare I say it..... wrong about something. As an adult I relish being corrected because it means next time I will know better but I could do without the 'idiot' attached at the end which I attribute to that untapped geyser of testosterone coursing through that lonely keyboard jockeys veins. If I still have to be called an idiot every once in a while by an actual adult then let their argument be of sound mind.
This made me smile. Good start to the day. Happy cake day to a strong woman! Sending wonderful reddit vibes. 
I too have my 10 year. Was a lurker for a year or so before hand. Never thought this site would be culturally significant. Feels like yesterday he made imgur because other hosting sites sucked.  
"Black girl in her early 20s here and I'm from Ghana lol. Not many people on reddit are even aware my country exists (Big ups to those who do though). I get where you're coming from. I not so much as hide my background but I rather don't see it as an essential factor to influence whatever you say or do on reddit. Unfortunately many people would try to use your sex and race against you but the most important thing is we're all human beings. ""If you cut us, do we not bleed?""
Happy 10th Reddit Birthday and it's nice to know you're out there. Happy redditing everyone!!"
"Wow - great story!   Thank you for sharing.  Sorry (but not surprised) to hear of abusive Redditors.  Glad you escaped your abusive relationship, and that‚Äôs too cool the Redditors helped you out.  

It‚Äôs always great to hear stories about people being good, especially since so much in the news and elsewhere is negative.  

May God bless you!"
"Hooray redditing!

I fit most of your demographics too, but I love arguing too much. If someone wants to think I'm a white man so they listen to me, I""ll take advantage of that."

"You go girl!  Thanks for sharing.  I‚Äôve seen redditors write some nasty things about others on this site, which just reflects their own issues.  They‚Äôre cowards who hide behind their computers in their moms basement and none of them would ever have the guts to say those nasty things to someone‚Äôs face.  But, I‚Äôve never seen so many strangers jump to help out another redditor in a jam and mean it. Need some money? A redditors got you.  Need someone to talk to? Redditor to the rescue.  Need money for an emergency?  Some redditor is trying to organize a fund for you.  It really is amazing. I‚Äôm so happy for you! "

I‚Äôm so ecstatic for your triumph! I guess I match your description myself so I really am glad for you but also for me as sometimes it seems so hopeless like nobody cares anymore. This is a good feels story!! Thank you.

I hope things continue to go well for you, and I wish you nothing but the best. Thank you for sharing!"
"I have been on this site for 3 years, but absolutely agree. There are some awesome people on this site. And some shitballs. But like you said, those are easy to ignore. 

This story warms my heart and shows there is an awesome community out there and they do not need to be physically present to make a difference in a random strangers life. Hats off to those that took it to the next level and were amazing human beings in the physical realm as well. 

Cheers to you! "
"Thanks for sharing! üíï Stories like these are so nice to read in between all of the bickering.

Happy Cake Day!"
"I don‚Äôt usually comment that much but damn this is a pretty remarkable story. Although this site can be pretty toxic sometimes, it is nice to see such goodness and empathy on this site. If I could I would upvote this story to infinity but sadly I can only do it once. "
Thank you for Sharing! I love reddit so much. I'm so glad you are doing good. Gives me hope. 
"Just curious, why do you prefer to lurk?"

This makes me hopeful for the future. Thanks for sharing your story.
"I left an abusive relationship as well about 12 years ago. It takes a lot of strength. You never think that you‚Äôll grow up to be a victim of domestic abuse. And you never expect it. It starts off so great and only slowly becomes awful and you always think ‚Äúit can be great again‚Äù. I‚Äôm glad you had the strength to leave and didn‚Äôt fall into the cycle. As for me, I‚Äôm in a great place now. Happily married with a kid. My husband is the best person I know. Kind and loving, generous, thoughtful. Just an all around good guy. I‚Äôm really happy for you. You are so strong. I had my parents to fall back on, so I didn‚Äôt do it alone. You had nothing but your guts. That‚Äôs really impressive. Congratulations on everything!"
Happy 10th cake day!!!  It's good to hear that the dark period is behind you.  Hope you stay for many more cake days.  
Happy cake day OP
"So proud that you had the strength to get out! 

Those claws can dig in deep, and it's hard to free yourself from them. But you did it! 

Good on ya! 

What a lovely post. :)"
"I am really glad that you got out of that relationship. Abuse is horrible, and I'm happy that you managed to get away.

I can relate to not disclosing your identity on reddit, even though I'm not black, or a woman, or middle age. I'm trans, and I actually came here after a thread where I had to report a lot of comments. This thread is really wholesome, and I'm glad I read it. Thank you for posting it."
This is great!! You're great!!! It's so wonderful to hear how loving the Reddit community can be after how negative the internet can be. Love from Los Angeles! :)

You may be a stereotype but you're absolutely awesome.

Thanks for sharing your story. There are some amazing people out there."
You amazing in every way. That's all I have to say.
"Wow! I really love your attitude. I wish I can be the same. I tend to be on the negative side, and I‚Äôm working on that every day. 

I wish the best for you OP! Anyone who talks shit is not a person worth arguing with. "

"Thanks for sharing this beautiful story. I'm new to Reddit and don't enjoy any other social channels. Not too long I almost deleted my account as I was noticing a similar sentiment overall. This is os enlightening, this is what I came here to find. Thank tou.

F RACISM."
"Hey, that's a great story. Happy Cake Day. "
"I feel like, well I hope, that those toxic users are just an obnoxiously loud minority. Sometimes those jerks almost turn me off this site, but there's also lots of good people here too and that pulls me back."
I've been on Reddit 1 day. Looks like I have something to look forward to.
"I Feel your story by heart. So touchy.

But i need some friends there on reddit .

 I am alone here!  (. - .)"
I am so happy for you!
I wish I could hug you
10k karma for 10 years. Nice!
"I always thought reddit full of just trolls and memes, looks like there's a side of reddit i have yet to explore! But then again, I've only been here a few months.

"My 13 year old son is sitting here giggling at me because I said that there were ninjas cutting onions in the house when he asked me what was wrong lol...Dang kids, don't they believe in onion ninjas anymore?! LOL! Anyways, it doesn't matter what your color, sex, or age...what counts is YOU are a strong person. The courage and strength it takes to pull through such a traumatizing event is difficult, but you did it! I did the same when my daughter was born and I was able to find a way out from his control, so I understand your fear and doubt you speak of....However, it warms my heart to know that humanity isn't completely lost in caring for their fellow human being..I'm glad compassion still exists. Faith in humanity - restored.  Thank you for sharing your story. I'm glad to hear you are doing wonderful now! Stay beautiful! \*hugs\*"
I don‚Äôt care about your skin color or gender. I love Reddit too. 
This is why I love reddit. Little moments like this 
"Truly made me smile, and literally about to cry. I'm so happy to see that despite how down you've been, you've made it to a  place in life that you're happy and satisfied with. While I hope not to experience what you have (because who would ever), I hope that if I do, people will help just as you have been helped. I never imagined I would, from a social media, but this post let me know that there truly are people out there who care, and you can find them in the most odd places.

I wish you luck and hope that whatever you do, you continue being happy with your choices in life."
This is so wonderful.   Positive people are the best part of reddit!  Thank you for sharing your story!  Happy TENTH cakeday! 
Happy Cake day :)
I've never seen ageism here unless it was boomers vs millennials. Sucks that people gotta sht talk you about something or another
"I've imagined a Black Mirror episode that is kinda like this, but it's not until about 20 years in someone shows them they've been shadowbanned all along. "
You're a beautiful person and we need more people like you and those from your story if we're ever going to change anything in this world.
"I showed my Mom a funny image today as I have many times over almost the past decade. The only difference this time was she asked back is this from reddit? I looked at her like I'd seen a ghost, I asked astonished how she knew about reddit, she responded ""Well it's a very big site isn't it? How could I not know about it."".

She's twice my age, us ""kids"" help her with things like turning on the TV because there's more than one remote. I thought to myself dear God when did reddit get this big that my Mom knows about it?!"
"I just want to hug you! We celebrated 23 years of freedom from my dad a week ago. This was an interesting little read, and I hope you have a great night."
Good luck!

"You should run for President ;)

Thank you for this uplifting Story for believing in humanity.

All the best from Hamburg"
It's a brilliant and heart touching story. Thank you for sharing it with us. 
"This is an amazing post! You sound like a woman with a lot of courage and I bet a lot of people look up to you because of it. Reddit can be such a toxic place, but posts like this remind me that it isn‚Äôt always bad. One of the things I love the most about Reddit is being able to have a complete stranger post something that really hits you in the feels. I hope you have an amazing rest of your life. "
"Wow! Wonderful to hear! Happy cake day, but even better, happy life! They say the best revenge is living well. 

Blessings to you!"
"I am so thankful to have your participation, and perspective, in this community. I‚Äôm a relative newbie, and your experience and mentorship of the amazing people who bring the conversations and insights that brighten my day and make me smarter are invaluable. So, thank you. 

And, and the same time, I‚Äôm so incredibly sorry that some members of this community have made it feel less-than-welcoming. That‚Äôs not who we should aspire to be. "
"I‚Äôm going on my eighth although I lurked for almost a year before making an account. This site has been everything to me. It‚Äôs helped me through so much and just overall learning of this country, so many cultures and the world itself. 

I can‚Äôt say i‚Äôm a fan of where it‚Äôs heading, or how this site hans‚Äôt felt the same since the death of Trayvon Martin. What used to be a place where we could all meet somewhere with common interests, now seems like we‚Äôre more divided through politics. Either way, this place will always have a place in my heart.


P.S. fuck digg. That‚Äôs how I ended up here! "
Happy cake day OP
This is a wonderful story and I hope that the next 10 years are even better.  Thanks for sharing!!
Do you guys think reddit will ever go back to the friendly free market of ideas it used to be? It just seems so saturated with propaganda and hatred now. I don't want to sound negative but reddit seems to be mortally wounded.
Oh damn I was curious and checked and it's been 8 years for me (probably 10 counting the years I lurked too scared to start an account lol). This really is a great site and I love reading stories amd experiences like this that keep my faith in humanity and keep me.comg back to this site everyday as well. Thanks for posting this!
"Happy Cake Day, your courageous post has been an inspiration to me. 

So pleased that things have turned out well for you. I appreciate you sharing your story and I hope the future keeps getting brighter. "
Very new to Reddit myself. I've known of it for years. But finally this year jumped on the wagon. It's been nice seeing the good and the bad of this website. You forget that humanity exist sometimes in the word we live in currently. But then you see wholesome people and events that bring a smile to you. To remind you there is plenty of good people out there. You just gotta look for them :) 
Were you part of the snappening?
I absolutely love this. Know some strong black women around here myself. Nothing but respect \_/\\\_
"I always imagine almost every redditor as a white, mid-20s man. I don't have any idea what made me assume this, as I'm a mid-30s woman."
"Grrrl, you give me hope! ‚úäüèΩ‚ù§Ô∏èüåà"
"You take a lot of shit, u/spez, but you made this and beyond cats and memes it makes a real impact on real people. Cool shit."
Its been that long? Ive been here for ten years. So many things have changed on this website. For better and for worse. But I pove it because I can have better conversations. Social Media mostly brings out the people who like it short and sweet. But I love Reddit because there is so much to read. From humor to really well executed explanations and side trivia. 
Loving the story! ‚ô•
11.2 years here! Wtf? 
"You're so cool! Sad that you went through that, but at least you're doing great now!"
Were any specific subs worse on the racism/sexism point of things?
"You have so little comment karma for 10 years, that's so interesting.

Do you tend to read and not comment too much?"
"Thats a nice story.
You're a nice person."
"I, too, am a middle-aged lady (not black tho) and I'm in my 9th year on reddit. I chose my username specifically because it references a dude so I wouldn't get harassed online. "
This is pretty great. Happy cake day. I‚Äôm one week away from my 8th! 
This is so sweet. Happy redditing!
"Hey, a fellow cake day person that is also middle aged. Granted, you've got 3 years more than me on my original account.

I hear ya when it comes to race... One side of the political spectrum is completely oblivious to it around them or think they are being brave by saying they are white and get harassed, too. Sorry folks, that is an apple to oranges argument on so many levels. And yes, the political subreddits of that party are completely washed in racism. Even your ""jokes"" aren't jokes when they are covered in dog whistles. The fact that they are never unique should be the biggest clue as to their intention. But whatever, nothing will change that anytime soon unless they have a mass paradigm shift.

Very glad to hear that you were able to get out of your abusive relationship. It's amazing what an internet community is capable of when someone is in need. People that willfully abuse others absolutely disgust me, and I'm glad you got to the point where you took action against it. I've known a few people in abusive relationships that waited far too long to leave and are still suffering major ramifications. A couple of them can't even leave their homes (agoraphobia) without feeling like they are breaking rules or that someone will harm them. Very glad to hear that you didn't get to that point.

Here's hoping for another 10 years that I hope will be even better than back then!"
"Happy cake day.          
And oh my goodness is your post inspiring üòä"
"Honestly. I'm so happy for you, you're awesome, be proud of yourself, sounds like you've come a long way ü§ó"

You are now my favorite Redditor
"Late twenties

This story had me in tears by the end. You‚Äôve really conveyed the impact on you, and I can‚Äôt help but feel proud of humanity for a brief moment. Thanks for being awesome - you, and the redditors who are here for each other in times of need."
"Congrats, I recently got my 10 year club trophy too.

Having strangers help and support you when you need it is awesome, but never forget that it took strength and determination to make the first move, leaving a bad situation. That was all you.

Good luck on the next 10 years."
üòÄ happy anniversary! 
"Made me smile
"
This is awesome. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve seen it all on here. I‚Äôm glad there are such amazing people to help you out when you needed it most. Kindness and empathy are not traits that society at large values enough. This is so warm and fuzzy.
Incredible! Thanks for stoking even more Reddit love up and out!
"Wonderful,really."
"Thank you for sharing :) I'm the most basic reddit demographic... white, mid 20's male. I wish it were worth more for me to tell you that I truly feel bad you've received hate just for being yourself. For what it's worth, here's just one more person who is happy to know about a slice of your life. Truly, all the best to you. I hope you continue to find happiness. "
Happy cake day! :) 
10 year redditor and you didn't put a TLDR  .... nice try troll 
"Incredible.

Thanks for sharing and good luck with all your future endeavours! "
Happy 10 year anniversary. Thank you for sharing. 
"I'm sorry part of the human race is flawed. I'll never understand why people can be so ugly to each other. I'm glad you got help and used it to get on your own two feet, the only two you can count on. Try to pass it forward. You can't let people like that bother you, they are their own punishment, living with a head that thinks that way."
Congrats on your success! Thanks for sharing your story! I had a sad day and this made me happy. I appreciate it! 
You and your story are amazing! May the rest of your journey on Reddit and the real world be glorious and rewarding! 
10 years good on you. Ignore the haters and do what you enjoy.

I hope you have 10 more awesome Reddit years. It's nice to know that people do have good experiences on Reddit. Happy cake day!
It's stories like this that continually restore my faith in humanity. 
Remknds of the time I used to browse on UC mini because data was fucking expensive.

Picking up your dog and keys that night must have been one of the most courageous things you have ever done, and there is very little doubt it probably saved your life.

"Been around awhile myself, though this account is newer. I've helped people moving into my city out and have been to a meetup before. Sometimes you gotta dig a bit, but generally you can find some great advice and caring people. Sucks that it doesn't always seem that way, but it's there. With so many people and lots of differing opinions, it can get a little messy.

Thanks for your post, it reminds me why I like this site and continue to browse."
"That's the sweetest note. I'm so pleased you are happy, sounds like you very much deserve it"
Huh I thought Reddit was all white and male. Happy cake though! 
"Amazing story! I've been browsing reddit for 3 years now. However I only use it for leisure purposes, kind of a lurker actually. How would I go about being a helpful member of the community? To help a fellow redditor the way you have been offered help in the past? From the UK btw. "
Happy cake day!
"Thanks for the post. Not everyone is that way towards middle aged black women. 

Most people are honestly your everyday friends.

Happy cakeday 
"As a fellow 10 year Reddit veteran, and completely the opposite of you. Except maybe the middle aged part... Am I middle aged now?
I wonder how many times we've been tickled by the same post, or outaged by it. Or even just reading things at the same time. It's so interesting that our lives can be so different but filled with the same stuff. Here's to 10 more. "
You are a beautiful woman inside and out !
"Been here 6.5. White, male, 23, not special at all."

Dope.
"As a white male raised in a white neighborhood surrounded by racism, I embraced it at an early age. When I got out I saw how the world really was. I have to say, sometimes people never leave those toxic environments and it's all they've known. I'm not defending them by any means but seeing the situation in an area like that, it doesn't surprise me to see such hate. Good story. Be good and stay safe. "
"What a great post.  It‚Äôs so heartening to be reminded that the vast majority of people are good and willing to help a fellow human in crisis.  Whatever differences we have, we share our humanity.  Thank you for the reminder!"

Very casual
"I fear that people have glommed onto this story because of how good people have been to you, and sort of let the beginning of the story fall into obscurity in their minds. I am glad you've had good experiences on the site.

I'm very glad you're now in a great place, and that people reached out to help you in your time of need! I know there's good people out there, but it's nice to hear about the good some people are doing.

I wish you a continued life of happiness and prosperity."

"Haha my girlfriend is 33 and she doesn't look a day over 25. She always say black don't crack.

Honestly though. Even in real life we experience racial issues and she for the most part ignores them. I know her well and I can see it bothers her even if she won't admit it. However, her own words of wisdom resonate with me and should with herself. People are ignorant and you can't change ignorance if they don't want to. So she moves on and tries her best to not let it bother her.

Best of luck and great story!"
"Is there a group passionately hating middle aged black women?

To be fair every account on reddit is a 25 year old white guy from the US until proven otherwise."
"It's always gives me the nice warm fuzzies inside when I get to see the good side of the human race in general, when people go out of their way to help a fellow person.

Glad you've enjoyed your 10 years here, I wish I found this site that early ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø"

I love that you had the strength to move away eventually and turn your life. This post is like a ""Minority report"". I'm a native African who lives in my home country and revealing that information lead me to give up my main account, faceless battles are a waste of time but I thought it was a minority incident, and I'm surprised that most of the commenters suffered from it in a way or another. But overall reddditors who are welling to help and participate in the time of danger are what rises and stood tall. Great community and a helpful one."

This is great. 
As a middle aged woman myself I know what you mean. For me it‚Äôs often best to just skip to the next post rather than engage. But I always feel drawn to posts like this - people who are sincere. Thanks for posting. I hope I see you around. ‚ù§Ô∏è
"That‚Äôs truly heart warming. 
It‚Äôs amazing where you can find community these days. Happy cake day from another Redditette. :)"
"Great story! I rarely read posts this long but this one seemed special.
    
Makes me think of the early 90s when I was a teen, I had a friend from a multiplayer internet game who I exchanged letters and pictures with. I remember being surprised at her picture, she too was a chocolate girl (as you said ;-) though I would have been surprised no matter what she looked like. I still remember her name, though I lost the picture.  
  
The online communities were much smaller then, but much like today showed the best and worst of people. The worst people would post or chat about groups they did not like (even towards all women) and probably assume most in their audience were white males around the world. I bet they were surprised when there were people from those groups there to hear their hate talk, as well as the best people to rush to the defense (even from around the world)."
"A woman on reddit?! I'm in shock!


All jokes aside, I hope you will continue to have a good time on here."
"One of the best bits of wisdom I've ever learned came from a muppets movie: ""Peoples is peoples.""

Despite all the hate we tend to spew at one another, despite all the accusations and the politics and the flame wars, when the chips are down and we know it, humans will generally try to help each other.  It's one of my favorite things about humanity.

I'm glad you got that help when you needed it.  And your little dog, too!  That had to be incredibly difficult, and I hope that life keeps moving up for you!"
This. It‚Äôs 5:40 am and you just made my day. You are amazing!
"I hope you get to be a Reddit celebrity now. I want to see your name popping up everywhere, like gallowboob."
Wow you went 2 years without a single post. Pretty neat
Good job girl. One of the things I love about reddit is we are all strangers but family and skin will never get in the way of that! I'm unfair a year but prefer reddit to Facebook bc we connect with no precursors

I just wanted to say hello and I really enjoyed reading your post. Have a good day
I was expecting more internet points from a **10 year old account**
I didn‚Äôt ready any of this...but cool
"Sometimes I feel like the only middle-aged woman on the site‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm glad to know you‚Äôre out there!  Happy cake day!

And damn!  You have guts, and read it has some good people. Cheers!"
<3
"I mean, looks like you post a lot in /r/blackladies which can be a pretty hardcore racist sub. "
welcome to the club...
I use jackwagon all the time. Made me smile to see it here too.
why are there so many [removed] messages 
:)
"You are really great, thanks for taking the time to share this with us!"
Thank you for sharing your story.
"5 years,joined in 11th grade mostly to discuss pc building.Reddit is the reason i have a career in IT today,reddit is how i found out i had a thing for engineering and computers. It thought me to program,get disciplined,helped me cure my marijuana addiction,helped me fight through pneumonia(have had it 4 times since i was a child),got me laid,thought me how to shave and other manly stuff my dad never did.

One of the best moments of reddit were after i had graduated high school in that summer i had serve case of pneumonia+bronchitis(coughing blood and serve nose bleeds) i was barely able to breathe which had already peaked my marijuana caused(i had been clean 6 months but anxiety stayed) axiety and paranoia and couple with not being able to breathe properly meant i thought i was definitely gonna die that week after sleeping. This awesome redditor who happened to be a nurse told me everything would be fine even though i asked her repetitively the same question,told me not to worry about and how i should sleep so that max amount of air goes into my lungs. 

This happened in the summer of 2016 if you are reading this,thank you for calming me down and assuring me that everything would be fine that week . 

You sound so cool,i wish i had a aunt like you. "
That's an incredibly inspiring story. And I almost died when you said Reddit was the tits. Thank you for staying and thank you for sharing
yoooo girl i freaking loved this whenever you wanna come to latin america you'll be well received okkkk b safe and good vibes all the times 
"Such an inspiring story ‚ò∫Ô∏è

Im curious though, would you say that people are less hateful now than they were 5-10 years ago? Or has it stayed the same? "
"Happy cake day, and a great story! I wish you all the best, and here's to the next 10 OP!"
"You‚Äôre awesome. Go you! I am so glad that Redditors supported you when you needed it, but sorry some folk on Reddit are asshats about your identity (and the identities of others).

Happy cake day from Scotland! :D"
Best story! I am so new to Reddit and afraid to post because of the incredible wit and humor people have around here! I‚Äôm always asking my bro (who got me onto it!) what everything means! He just shared your story post with me and I absolutely love it.  You should be so proud of who you are and how far you‚Äôve come!
Middle aged woman here and I so appreciate you sharing your story. I‚Äôm inspired that you found so much kindness here. I have found Reddit to be a huge welcome change from other social media. Thank you for putting yourself out there. Happy Cake üéÇ Day!!!
"10 years 3 months and counting :) I'm from 2008. Time passes, Reddit passes too... no, it's just me who is passing.."
Cheers!!!
I'm glad you are out of that mess in the past! I like nice stories like this. You just put a smile on my face!! 
Thanks for posting this. 
Happy Cake üç∞ day! I‚Äôm Very happy for you and proud of the strength you had in that situation to walk away. May your next 10 years on AND off Reddit be filled with continued success and happiness! - fellow brown girl 
"You just made a 16 year old male choke up a little bit. Ok, maybe a lottle bit."
"I've also been on here that much, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. (Although I do appreciate your story about it's good side.) 

Congrats on getting out of the abusive relationship. "
"Hey, middle aged black lady. Have a great day!"
I preach the greatness of reddit to my friends. i dont think they see what this site can do for a person. ive been here for over a year and its been a mostly positive experience. You never know where reddit will have you next. Happy 10th cake day wow!!!
"I am so happy you received the support and love you needed, when you needed it. congratulations on escaping your abuser... you are a survivor!"
This is one of the loveliest things I‚Äôve ever read on Reddit ‚ù§Ô∏è 
"Thanks for sharing, this gave me chills.

Best of luck everyone. "
Ok so sorry for spilling my r/drunk all over your cake day but HAPPY BIRTHDAY!üëç Last one and no PMs üëç.
Saved as a piece of reddit history right here.
Happy cake day to us :') 
Black girl magic right here! Cheers to you. 
"Anonymity brings the worst in people because they can say anything without any consequences for themselves. It also highlights the good in people, when they help a stranger not to look good but simply because it's the right thing to do. "
"You now have more karma in this post than you've attained in your entire decade of Redditing, lol. That's what you get for only making quality posts instead of just reposting garbage!"
Happy cakeday! This strengthens my belief that good people usually ends up surrounding themselves with other good people eventually.
Yeah! 
So happy for you!! Thank you for sharing your path with us. You deserve a life filled with positive love and freedom to be you. 
Upvote for good use of jackwagon
"Thank you for this post and congratulations on your incredible strength to walk out and start anew. Coming from a similar experience, I appreciate the emotional toll it takes to share your story.
Peace & Love "
"I don't know why racism still exist nowadays. It's stupid and unnecessarily to look down on somebody because of their race or gender or age.

It was really nice reading your story üëç"
Wow. Awesome story. I am an active member of r/stopdrinking. Reddit has been an amazing and important part of my recovery...I'm not sure I would have been able to liberate myself from alcohol addiction without it. Thank you for a great post!
"Those karma numbers are rookie numbers, step it up girl"
"Likewise and I think the site's gone to hell, especially in the last four or so years as its popularity has surged. I can't wait to leave for a better alternative."
"I'm a guy but my username says ""girl"" and I get soooooo much casual misogyny that it's nuts. I have never been called ""cunt"" so often before. And on gaming subreddits nobody wants to take me seriously! "
"wow! great story!! Happy for you!!
"
"I'm right there with you (ten years, also). This place has changed. What's the biggest change you've observed?"
This was refreshing. Thank you. ‚ò∫üíú
"So my girlfriend is a black Redditor, except she doesn‚Äôt even post anymore, she just lurks, but also, good for you! I hope things get even better these next 10!"
"I very rarely write comments,  but thank you for your story, it restores my faith in humanity "
What a sweet post.   Happy Birthday middle-aged black woman!
"Cool deal, i have a dumb question for ya lol, I was being nosey and looked at your badges, why did you only do secret Santa a couple times? I‚Äôve been considering joining that for a while but never have."
AYYYYYYYY HAPPY CAKE DAY! üéÇ
Happy Cake Day!!!!!!
"I'm happy for you, happy 10th Reddit years"
I've been on Reddit for about 5 years. This is my favorite story I've ever read. You describe the purpose of Reddit perfectly. Thank you. 
I'm glad that people have been kind to you and I wish you the best going forward.
happy cake day 
"You know, I go on a site called slashdot.org, I go there about everyday for 20 years now... it's like a drug üòä"
"First, thanks for sharing!  
Second, jackwagon is the most wholesome thing ever to call an asshole. Love it."
Can‚Äôt even begin to imagine the amount of times you must have seen some of the same re posts over the years. 
Very nice story and best wishes !
It's crazy that we could have been on one site for so long. Happy 10 years from a fellow long timer here. I hope the next ten have more greatness ahead for you!
"Happy Cake Day, and I'm happy for you."
Congrats!! Happy decade!
I have the cake too
"I woke up and the first thing I did was checking out reddit. I saw this post and it made me genuinely happy and reminded me of humankind also achieving good things. There is a lot of hate on this website, be it small or big. It is easy to forget that this site is also a pure bundle of joy and happiness. "
Sending you peace and love my sister 
May the good shine through in everywhere you go. :)
Happy cake day!!! Keep on being awesome and wholesome. 
This is so impressive!  Now I know where to come if ever I'm in need!  
How would you say Reddit has changed in the last 10 years? 
Meanwhile I‚Äôve been on reddit almost 7 years and haven‚Äôt formed any relationships on the site let alone made actual friends with anyone. 
Well I think you are a badass! It makes me happy and a bit teary eyed to know you've had this success and help in this time. 
Why'd you stop doing secret santa?  You were an og.
I made my first account in 2011 but recently deleted it because I had too much personal info on there and it was way easier to just delete the whole thing. I found reddit through the rage comics app -_-
I needed this - thank you 
Happy cake day! 
"Hey, this is supposed to be casual! No tearjerkers! ;)

Happy you're doing better. And glad to hear something objectively positive come out of the site. It's moments like this that see me coming back. "
Thank you for being open and telling your story! You are a beautiful person!
How have you seen reddit change during your time on it?
"Thank you for your story. You have had a hell of a ride and im so glad you are in a better place now.
I randomly downloaded reddit this year but
 only truly began to use it during my maternity leave. I was feeling very isolated at that time, but talking to people who had no expectation of me  (along with the same likes) reallyyyyy. helped . 

Btw: Hispanic 30 yr old woman hereüòÅ"
Happy cake day. That‚Äôs a beautiful story and if I could afford it I would give you gold. It‚Äôs lovely to hear you‚Äôre back on track now ‚ò∫Ô∏è
"Wonderful, incredible story!  I pray the rest of your life continues as wonderful as it is now!!!"
I know I am late but thank you so much for sharing this. And thank you for being a part of this community. 
Im sorry that people fucking suck. Happy reddit anniversary. 
I normally never click on the popular tab but glad I did in this case. 
"I've been on reddit for not much longer than you have. After reading your post, I'm realizing just how much has happened in my life since I started using reddit. Randomly browsing my reddit history, I can almost pinpoint specific events that occurred over the last decade related to career, relationships, vacations, maturity and personal development, good times and bad times, babies being born, friends and family members passing away. My life is very different now.

So much has changed. But the one constant: reddit."
"Frankly I‚Äôm disappointed that you don‚Äôt have a snapped trophy, how you miss that?

The rest is awesome. I‚Äôve also seen some ish here!"
"You sound like you have a beautiful soul :)

If you ever visit seoul, pm me. 

Ill show you around~"

"Also a long time Redditor. It's really a great place, filled with great people and stores - just choose the prism to view the site carefully. Like subscribing to CC for interesting stories from interesting people! üòÉ"
"I loved hearing your story, I'm glad your life is great now! "
"Wow, what‚Äôs a great story. I love a good community. Thank you so much for making this one better. "
"Wow. I've only joined Reddit earlier this year (because the username I initially wanted was already taken and subsequently abandoned after a few posts), and I managed to get the magical (to me) date of 12/3/18. I actually didn't know they added the cake next to the username on the user's ""Reddit Birthday"", and I felt glad I now know about this! I can now predict what I might be doing on 12/3/19."
"This is why I love reddit. Yeah I can look at stupid memes and shit posts, but I can also connect with people. No matter what‚Äôs on my mind, there is some subreddit out there where people will listen.

I‚Äôm glad you got the support you needed."
"I know it's harder to hear than say, but don't let people get you down.  Live you life like you want (as long as it doesn't harm (not offend) others).

My grandma told me many thing, but one is important for redditing. 

1. Insults from others just proves that they can't logically debate your point anymore. What those people don't grasp is that their insults also lessen their credibility.

When people throw insults my way, I point that out to them and that when they do so, it makes people stop caring about them. 

That almost always cuts them off hard. "
10 years.  Wow.  I remember joining Ars Technical in 2000.  It‚Äôs crazy to think how time has hanged the internet.  Back then when it was so new and wild. 
"Aw that‚Äôs so nice, reddit really has been a big part of my life this past year or so. Definitely not to the same degree as that but it has helped me come to terms with my identity in the lgbt community and given me outlets for a lot of hobbies that are kinda weird or niche.




Also lots of cute animals and memes"
"I'm coming up on 9 years, 8 with his account. Time is moving wayyy too fast."
Wait did this get hold taken away?  I'm certain this post had 10 last night
"Happy Cake Day!
As another middle aged minority woman (4 yr club though), your post meant a lot to me.  Thanks for sharing it. While I have a lot in common with other redditors because of the topics/subs we share; like you I don‚Äôt really reveal my demographics (feels safer not to). I am today though. 
Also have a great Cake Day!!!"
I really want some Takis
I wouldn't defend or debate jack with people. They can call me anything they wish and ill just smile at them...I care not
"Ha, only ten years? I've been reading reddit since 19-dickety-two, ever since the Kaiser stole our 20s.

People used to send in punch cards to the reddit central office, which were photocopied and then mailed to everyone who had subbed. Then you had to go over the photocopies and punch out the holes before feeding the cards into your own computer to find out what they said.

It took two to three weeks to get your picture of a cat sitting in a shoe box, but people appreciated it more!"
Happy reddit birthday!
"This is one of the best things I've read today.   Thank you!
"
"Not demeaning your story or anything, it's a phenomenal story, but this doesn't seem very well suited for this sub. "
"I‚Äôm sure this is going to be buried as I‚Äôm late to the party but I just have to say, YOU ROCK! Also as someone who has been in a similar situation financially and is also much more stable, I am so proud of you! It‚Äôs not an easy thing to do and the fact that you have worked, pushed and persevered is something to be proud of. "
All are welcome here.
Love your story and your strength . What an inspiration! Stay strong lady and GOD bless. 
"Heyyyy, happy 10th cakeday. I just had mine a few days ago. :)"
"Not that it‚Äôs relevant to your conversation, but the most popular song on the day you joined Reddit was I Kissed A Girl by Katy Perry."
Congratulations and happy birthday to your new life!!!! I‚Äôm so proud of you!!!! 
Happy cake day 
"I'm so proud of you girl! I am so glad that you were able to find support somewhere, and here on reddit of all places. I'm inspired by your courage. 

My buddy just reminded me of my love for the funk, here's the track he shared:

Love from a not-so-feisty middle aged white-as-hell man. "
"You...are the champion, my friend!

I get pissed off at Reddit sometimes for being filled with children of all ages (up to middle age even) but I have had some good, supporting experiences here too. You can still find these pockets of gold and it's wonderful! Now I have gotten my wife into it (after six years...bleh) and I am experiencing the newness all over again."
Oh man I bet you could write a doctoral thesis on the development of memes with first hand expirence. Cool!
I think you're awesome.  I'm glad everyone here isn't a 20 year old dude.
How much longer do I have to be here until I turn into a middle aged black woman? Asking for a friend 
I love hearing about how people don't suck and can be kind of wonderful.  Thank you for helping me keep up with my preferred worldview!
Happy cake day!
Been here since the Digg invasion.
"I am happy you are part of Reddit and I appreciate you contributing this post! :)

What a fantastic post that really enumerates the human condition. 
What an awesome story. Thanks for sharing and I'm glad you're doing so well!
Happy cake day! 
"I'm adding ""jackwagon"" to my vocabulary now. Thanks for sharing and sorry people can be such jackwagons on here, but good on you for not letting it get you down! "
"Aw man, this made me tear up a bit. Great story, glad you had a nice outcome!"
I love this post so much. Happy cake day! 
"Woah, it's amazing "
I love this story so much!!  Thank you for sharing
"We got here about the same time. I've seen it take it's ups and downs, but the general people here show me there are at least some good in the world. "
39 year old white lesbian chiming in. I totally understand. Been here for awhile. I like to believe there is more kindness here than not. I'm very glad everything worked out for you. Thank you for sharing this with us. 
This is what this site is about.
Happy 10 years!
What are your favourite moments on Reddit? 
üòÅ
Happy cakeday
"That‚Äôs about how long I‚Äôve been here. Lurked for a while before creating an account. Amazing to see the changes over the years. The Digg exodus, the f712u comics coming and going (and coming again!), the fall of libertarian popularity and rise of liberalism, the shift to image-based content, the decline of HN-type content, all very interesting. Still browse every day though I don‚Äôt fit the average demographic."
"Hello fellow 10 year redditor! Happy anniversary. I'm glad you're doing well. I guess you're helping others, too, but you should mention it, not to brag, but to model good behavior. "
"I've been on Reddit since 2006, I've created a few different names over the time. So this current one doesn't really show my time here. 

I gotta say, the whole concept is nothing new I've always been a huge forum user since the late 90's... It just surprises me how popular this site got over the years. "
"Cool, glad to have you! I've been coming for about five years I think. "
nice
I Love this!!
"The Civil Rights Movement happened partially because of a middle-aged black woman. You've nothing but my respect, miss. The world may never be equal but someday I hope we can get close. Be safe, be well and God bless. "
Happy Cakeday! I‚Äôm so glad I read your story here in CC! Happy that you‚Äôre doing well after all that shit happened. Holy fuck!
I went there and I could not figure out how to enter my user name here.
"Also I am an older white woman, so I hope that makes you happy too."
"Just out of curiosity, what subreddit did you turn to when you where lost and in need of help? "
"I feel like I need to drop and run too, but I don't know how to start because I lack the resources. What was the source of help that surprised you the most?"
"This showed up in my feed and I just had to click and read! That is so awesome! Ten years ago I was a 22 year old college student who had no idea Reddit existed! Ten years on a website is an amazing feat to accomplish! (Also, doesn‚Äôt ten years feel like yesterday? Lol)

I hope to find connections like you did! I‚Äôm glad Reddit did something positive for you! I hope it does positive things for many others as well!

Yay for ten years! "
Thanks for sharing that with us. I didnt read most of your post because thats my MO. But youre awesome and people are jerks.
"Hi fellow female of a certain age. I see you. Thank you for mentioning the poor treatment by ‚Äújack wagons‚Äù. I have only been a redditor for 3 years but in that three years I have received dozens of hate messages from people who knew I was female and didn‚Äôt have anything to contribute to the topic we are discussing but they just thought they would tell me I am a dumb bitch who doesn‚Äôt know what she is talking about instead of trying to prove me wrong with facts. Sometimes they are so dumb that they think I am a guy and then they call me a fag or some other shit. Carry on doing what you do, and I will too. Eventually there will be more of us here and we can maybe try to curb some of the hate. "
Holy shit that's an amazing story. Thank you so much for sharing. I'm so glad you got away from that abusive situation. You're an inspiration. 
"Thank you, I was terrified when I did it.  And I‚Äôm not going to say it was easy because it wasn‚Äôt. But I‚Äôm happier now than I have ever been. Also if I can do it so can anyone else."
Ppl called you out on being middle aged? What a petty thing
You... you are my hero :)
"Damn. I can‚Äôt imagine what that‚Äôs like. I‚Äôve had different accounts here since 2011 and still can‚Äôt imagine the kind of abuse you‚Äôre about to get for this post.

I sincerely hope you have a good night."

"Sweet, I knew I had a black friend!"
"It's redditors like OP that I actually wouldn't mind to meet in real life cause you seem like the coolest of cool people. I'm a white, mid 30's male from Tennessee. The southeast can get a bad rep sometimes, but I promise we're not all like the stereotype might often suggest. Happy cake day. "
"Sorry bout your IRL mishaps, Shit can be shit. Thank your stars you had someone around to help you shovel outta the shit. But Ten years eh? Same Account eh? Seems so... Now I gotta ask the hard questions... I've been on site near as long, HOW DO YOU KEEP FROM BEING BANNED BY THE MOTHERFUCKING POWERTRIPPIN' MODS? Seriously this has been getting as bad as Faceplace, seriously trippy shit when you can't speak your mind without getting the banhammer. "

Weird right? It's like my opinion is the same here because I have no face to show them I am different from them.  Like I'm an assumed white man with my asshat passionate opinions and people show me respect... It's weirdly empowering. I could be sad about it, but I'm just glad I have the option SOMEWHERE. "

All i got out of this was that this site has been around for trn years
<3
What season / episode is this from?
Thank you. 
Awwww thanks! Appreciate you taking the time to let me know! :-) 
Proud to be part of a community with you! Good vibes & here‚Äôs to your next 10 years in the Reddit-sphere!
"Very cool post, will use it at times when showing people why they should give this site/app a chance. "
YES IT IS!!!! Happy Cakeday!! We're Reddit twinsies! 
You get a cake! And you get a cake!
"To determine the day that you joined Reddit, go to your profile, (eg http://www.reddit.com/user/TYPEYOURUSERNAMEHERE) and hover your mouse over the section in the sidebar that says ""XX years"". A tooltip will appear displaying the exact date and time of your account creation. You receive a cake icon next to your name every year on that same day (give or take a few hours)."
Omg what a CUTIE!!!
Ooh it's like a surprise party!!
"SO THAT'S WHAT IT IS? I thought it was a crooked envelope or something.

Cool."
Happy cake day!üëç
"Ooooohhhhhh, it's a piece of cake. I thought it was a slightly askew envelope. Well, I feel dumb. Well, happy Reddit cake day to you. It sounds like you've had an overall great experience on Reddit, despite the occasional jackwagon. It just reinforces what I've felt for a long time. The  Reddit communitt is something special. "
"Hope y‚Äôall have the cakiest of days!!!! 

10 reddit years is massively impressive. 

-Love, mid-30s female who feels pride in you owning yourself & your story. "
I always thought it was an envelope or something. I knew what cake day was I guess I just never put 2 and 4 together. 
"I thought cake day was Reddit's way of celebrating your birthday and posted ""cake day memes"" on the wrong say like some giant fool."
What‚Äôs cake and what‚Äôs gold?
happy cake day!!
Lucky me has cake day on 9/11...
"Middle aged woman who has been here 8-ish years. Sometimes I feel so awful and underrepresented here, but then something like this happens and it gives me hope that someday everyone who posts online won‚Äôt be assumed to be a 20-something white male. 

Thank you and good luck in all of your future endeavors."
Middle aged minority woman here too. I actually don‚Äôt mind some snap backs I‚Äôve gotten (especially in sport subs) because I feel like the context would change if people thought I were female. If they think of me as ‚ÄòHey buddy‚Äô then I feel that I get more honest feedback. I feel about as represented here on Reddit as I do the rest of the world; c‚Äôest la vie.
"Maybe it's a selection bias, because when racists see that a poster is black they're going to spout some bullshit about it, but when other people see it they're not going to say anything because they don't care."
"The ones willing to go to meetups probably aren't the ones screeching racist vitriol, tbh"
"Yet another middle aged woman with 10+ years on reddit. For every post that makes me want to scream, there are an equal number(like yours) that make me realise that even the wilds of the internet can contain a community. Congratulations on your achievements and thank for sharing!"
I had to gild you because you seem so positive. Your account is pretty old.. (uh.. you totally aren't though) and I just got guilded this week for shitposting. Gotta make it right.
"33 year old white male here, I don't believe you one bit.. we're redditors none of us are ""normal"" üòú"
"I think those who are evil are the loudest, so they come off as a huge presence. But there are many nice people around us every day! Have a great weekend my friend!!"
"Standard millennial white guy here. One of my favorite things about reddit is the anonymity of each individual. I think it‚Äôs cool to read others posts/comments without any potential pre judgement on the type of person they are (whether it‚Äôs race, gender, age, looks, etc).  But rather judge them on the content of their post. Of course there are always trolls and jackasses, but it is the internet. "
"I‚Äôm Hispanic as well. I am new to reddit. I find a lot of wonderful things and people here as well as a lot of ugly. I guess that is how the world is, good with the bad. All we can do is focus on the positive and spread the love. "
"Sadly, the amount of popularity Reddit has gained in recent years has really brought some of the worst of the internet here. Thankfully, the core user base of Reddit at least seem to be like decent people. This is the type of story Reddit is capable of producing, and it really is magical. The ability to bring people together based on mutual hobbies, fandoms, and opinions is what makes Reddit and all of its individual communities so great. Though there is more hate and a lot of shilling going around, if you're a decent person, chances are you can connect with another decent person somewhere on this site. "
"Only the most hateful racists are motivated enough to actually write a racist comment. When you get a racist comment or message, you don't get the 99 messages from people explaining how they do not have a problem with your ethnicity. Not having an issue with someone's ethnicity is not something that pushes someone to write a message. "
"I get it. The key is finding subs you feel comfortable in and avoiding the major subs. I don't set foot in any sub that's on the front page. (Except for this one.. as the Mods here are pretty fantastic and everyone is truly friendly). 

It took me a while to figure out avoiding the popular subs was the way to go as I thought doing so would alter my ""Redditing"" experience, make it less fun and I'd be missing out.. but the exact opposite has happened and I really enjoy Reddit again. You have to dig a little deeper and work a little harder to find the friendly subs, but they're here! "

Thank you.. I def feel like I've an angel watching my back  that led the kind Redditors to me on that night... (My mom). 
"Sounds pretty similar to me, expect I'm kind of an anxious wreck at times, so I still delete comments that get too downvoted."
"I agree man, when I joined reddit in 8th grade it was like the cool older brother I never had. Taught me stuff, made me laugh, showed me his porn collection... 

Using it daily during my teenage years definitely really shaped me as a person, and I'd *like* to say it's for the better, but I think it's mostly because I was somehow able to resist the more toxic aspects of the site."
"I feel like my sense of humour developed so much by gauging reactions on the internet during that formative phase that though I can be funny IRL, it can hard for other people to tell when I am joking because my vocalizations just didn't develop alongside my sense of humour. "
Are you me?? Because that sounds exactly like me lol. I'm still not a big fan of commenting still though and tend to over think before I hit send. On average it probably takes me like 10-20 min to reply lol.
"I thought Reddit was going to be an amazing platform for politics, getting people involved, and to really move democratic discussion forward in a really positive way.

I didn't see the same thing gives a *huge* opportunity for propaganda and for state-level operatives to really shape public opinion to their narrative."
"Exactly my thoughts, coming up on 7 years now"
Fellow six year redditor! I'm just a lurker on a lot of subs. 
"Hey, same! We must be roughly the same age. I still get the doom feeling sometimes when I have a message, but lately I just haven‚Äôt been caring if someone gets argumentative with me, and I‚Äôve actually been commenting more often. I also think being on reddit throughout the past 6 years has exposed me to a lot of things I wouldn‚Äôt have been exposed to elsewhere (some bad things, many good). I agree about the addiction part haha "
"> reading articles I wouldn't bother to read in a high school library, TIL's, etc.

Great callout! When I first joined Reddit it was a really great news source. While now you have to dig a little deeper to find the great news sources on Reddit.. because of Reddit I only read my news instead of watching it. I devour reputable online news sites and I like to read different perspectives of the same story . 

Also, if you like TIL.. check out /r/explainlikeimfive  
I've learned a lot from that sub too! 
"
"Always pay it forward.. before and after the incident. I'm so very lucky that I was raised in a household where my mother was always helping others so giving back to my community has always been huge for me. I never expected to be on the receiving end though.. Its so hard for me to ask for help.. 

Whats so wonderful now though is that my life has changed so significantly that I am able to help others so much more than I'd ever dreamed I would be able to in this lifetime. I'm launching my own non profit shortly.. I'm so excited, pumped and damned grateful! "
Redditing is like the BEST addiction ever... :-) 
That's pretty damned awesome.

"I love music, funk is one of my fave genre's.. I also had just purchased a kitten around the time I found Reddit. 

So I was like: ""funk kitten"" or ""fun kitten"" ... and when I typed it.. funkitin came out.. Silly I know..but i felt like a creative genius at the time. "
Awesome...Thank you too!!!! 
There are some stories that have sprung from reddit. The time someone on legaladvice saved someone else from CO poisoning comes to mind. There should be some place that archives all those things.

"I met a white Jamaican once in New Zealand, he said I was the first person to ever guess his accent correctly. He told me how some Jamaican people have a saying regarding their work ethic for very physical labor: ‚Äúchop and move‚Äù, he said it came from people working in sugar harvesting, the workers would use a machete(?) to chop the plant, then move to the next, and remembering that saying helped them to continue when they were tired. Coincidentally, this was around the same time of the digg exodus (which I was part of). Interesting guy though, he and his wife were friends with a former U.S president (Regan?) and he showed me a framed photo of them skiing together back in the day and that they still holiday together once a year"

Hi BiggMuffy. Did you make it through your night okay?
"Please DM me. My inbox is a bit overwhelming right now, but I am definintely here."
"Great question!!! I actually came to Reddit during the Digg exodus. I actually hadn't been on Digg that long, I didn't really understand all the drama that was occuring, I stayed with Reddit because I liked the UI. But that wasn't your question.. LOL 

Reddit is hands down worse. When I first joined, I lurked a great deal as I never really had a great deal to contribute to the conversations because as you mention, they were heavily tech focused. Which was intriguing and amazing to me. The conversations on Reddit were deep and thought provoking and I learned a LOT on a myriad of subjects. Whenever it did occur that I'd reveal my race, it was no big whoop. Today, I only feel comfortable revealing my race/gender in a sub I deem to be one where Redditors with common sense hang out. Like this one. 

Today, I'd be afraid to come to Reddit the same way I did those years ago. I'm sure I'd be attacked rather quickly.. and those Redditors that genuinely wanted to help me probably would not have been able to get to me before I gave up and left the internet forever due to the backlash my post would have received!

"
I also have a gendered username! Its fun when someone disagrees with you but they can tell you are a lady so it gets all weird and personal and WRONG so fast! 
"There are a lot of dissatisfied people on the internet looking to pick fights because it's like a sport to them.

"Upper middle-aged Indian guy with family here. I keep forgetting that Reddit has a lot of diversity and is worldwide. For some reason, the angry white males seem to have gotten a disproportional amount of space on Reddit. I was here over 10 years ago and I remember how nice a community it was. It still is in the sub-reddits but I really don't have time to look at anything other than the front page most of the time.

Thanks for reminding me."

"I think it started 13 years ago. I'm in the 12 year club! I discovered reddit at a pretty young age and have grown up with it! It was a really awesome place in the past, but around 2010 it changed dramatically when the Digg exodus happened. It's never been the same since. 

The comment section was incredible before if became really popular. I loved to read news articles and come back to the comments for most insightful conversations about the content. 

Slashdot was also a cool community like reddit but I haven't gone there in years. "

IT is.. there are people out there that are truly phenomenal.
"2008 Reddit was very techy, lots of geeky folk, the nerditry was strong, I was in awe of most Redditors. I wanted to be like them. I lurked and read and learned a lot. The conversations always felt pretty deep and thought provoking.It really did feel like a community, I was hooked from day one.

My favorite part about the old Reddit - the negative attitudes towards those that are different didn't bubble up to the surface and permeate Reddit the way it does today. The baddies stayed underground in their own ugly subs and left the rest of Reddit alone. 
"
"ha haha.. you're welcome. You know whats funny is sometimes I start typing and I'll type a word and I'm like.. whoa, where did that word come from? That's one of those fancy words.. what are you doing to me right now brain? Let's hit dictionary.com to make sure you're on the up and up... LOL.

Reddit was something I stayed away from for a long time because I heard bad things about it. But then I finally joined it because why not? I haven't looked back since. It's my Most used app.
I thought so too. Which is why I was confused. My birthday was a week ago. I thought Reddit was just drunk.
"Well, the cake day is your reddit birthday. For example today is my 2 year anniversary on reddit. So I get the cake thing. Gold is reddit's premium service type of thing. You get some special benefits. And if you have Creddits you can gild someone (that's the golden star next to my name) and it gives people a month of gold."
Thank you. :)

Where do you find the ugly? I don't remember seeing much tbh.

I can't make a casual post, those don't even get seen. No use in trying.

But if I'm reaching out for advice or help, which I have to have rock bottom in sight before even considering, it all goes so very wrong in nightmarish ways. Half the time, the sub I spent 20 minutes looking for that finally fits the bill because they're all too specific? Nope my post still isn't on topic (and then I see a variation of my situation a week later hit the front page.) The rest of the time, it's the commenters being unusually crappy, regardless of if they're even providing input. Then I get two comments tops providing advice that either isn't useful or I've already said was a route I took. I'll throw them and upvote and a thank you, but ultimately I get nothing out of my ""help please"" posts that stay up.

Edit:... Sorry, got carried away. I made a throwaway last night to post about something, finally found the sub that might have answers, saw a post in the same vein as mine, and got spooked by the purely venemous response to it. "

Now I often feel like the comment section is just filled with people rattling off the same predictable one-liners and responding to honest questions with sarcastic non-answers. I've taken to disabling inbox replies on every comment I write, because it opens the door to being randomly attacked by strangers without intentionally choosing to go back and read what was written on a particular post. It gives me control over when/how/if the cesspool is allowed to affect me.

I keep looking for something better to fill my time with but I guess habit brings me back. :/"
"Middle aged here. I miss the Internet of 10-15 years ago. There was so much *respect* at this communicative gift to the world. 

Once we could vote on each other's words/thoughts and not simply discover them, all that was over. 

Now everything is so common and base. I think the difference is growing up and discovering something new vs growing up with something always there. Now we are born into a nonstop 24/7 popularity contest, ad-supported and reliant on Pavlovian endorphin highs. Cheapens everything. 

I miss old Slashdot and TWOP. And message boards and AIM / Yahoo culture. Sure, there were dark, experimental places but you had to really go find those interests yourself. The universal login and ID, the commoditization of storage and bandwidth directly enabled the Wal-Mart-ing of the online experience. Once Facebook forced a real name on us, then the flipside of anonymous usernames as a response to that loss of privacy split our online psyche in two. Nowadays a whole person is almost never presented, there's too much data risk (doxxing)

The point I was trying to make is that sometimes it's appropriate to fight fire with fire. Just downvoting/ignoring isn't enough. We should be calling shit like that out and not allowing it to fester. Having responded to a statement that wasn't made, I guess that didn't come across very well.

Nothing outrageous or incredibly wrong with that, but you could find it a bit annoying or you could find it makes you feel a bit invisible, and sometimes when you just casually mention you aren't (in this example) a middle-aged woman, you get hate just because you mentioned it.

It's true I read that [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/casualconversation/comments/8yptoe/_/e2d8uyo)!
"Well, I've talked about experiences which I have because of my background before. So, for instance, you could guess I'm probably in my 20s because I've mentioned how much I love napping as a med student. I imagine other experiences are quite specific to middle age and someone might end up bringing up their age to better explain the experience. Same goes for gender. I've mentioned I'm a woman where it's relevant, like when I'm talking about my traveling experience or catcalling. I also tend to let people know so they use the right pronouns if I intend to interact with them for a long time and if I've already been talking to them for a while (like in an online game). "
"> or that racism doesn't still exist

Racism isn't limited to a single skin color, and arguably tolerated in today's america - if it's anti-white racism.

Racism also carries no weight in a user's interaction on reddit unless they make race part of their identity - bringing it back to our original point.

IKR it‚Äôs crazy right?? It‚Äôs just so otherworldly and unique

That‚Äôs a good pick.  You can‚Äôt go wrong with Landyachtz.  Rayne has some good downhill boards too (it‚Äôs been a while since I boarded so I couldn‚Äôt name any off the top of my head).  I hate to be that guy but make sure you invest in some safety equipment too!  My knees still click when I kneel and my brain probably has some damage too.  Long boarding is a lot of trial and error 
I‚Äôve got an atom and it‚Äôs pretty good for downhill but I loosened up the trucks a ton for turning and it‚Äôs a little more wobbly going on steep hills so idk
Longboarding is so much fun! I have a bit of a Frankenstein monster when it comes to mine haha. I suggest checking out /r/longboarding there's lots of useful stuff there
Honestly i dont mind thanks for the tip. You arw that guy but its needed i hadnt even thought about those yet. Thanks bud.
"Also forgot to add you have any recommendations on pads?
"
I did my post was removed lol ill try again tho
"You don't need to post anything, there is stuff already on there you can check out that might help. Also I find watching youtube videos of people downhilling can help, they tend to have their set up in the description "
Thanks m8 i honestly overlooked it then. I usually see posts solely on longboards that have just been purchased. I think i just need to look harder
"I don't really mind spoilers, because while you know what's going to happen, you still don't know HOW it's going to happen, or all the other theatrics they show on the screen for the whole movie. Saying that "" this major person died"" in the movie is such a small part in terms of everything else that goes on. I'd get annoyed if someone told me how it happened, as i'll know when the scene starts but telling me just ""this person died"" gives me no information on when it might happen. Therefore it won't matter. "
"Nobody likes a spoiler. That's why when Im talking about movies or shows, I always ask the other person if they've already seen them."
"Of course not, I personally love having movies spoiled for me..."
"I don't mind spoilers. I've known important plot details for some games and anime series before I've seen them, and that didn't hamper my enjoyment of them (Like, I might know that a character will die, but that's not the same to me as playing or watching and experiencing that character's death, how it affects other characters, why their death is important, etc.)   
  
That's just me though. I would never purposely spoil something for someone, and I try to be careful about saying something spoiler-ish unless I know the person with whom I'm talking has watched or played the thing we're talking about already."
"Personally, I don't mind spoilers that much and I usually look them up on purpose (especially for horror films!). I kind of enjoy seeing how the plot builds to the spoiler. And with old stuff, I think spoilers are unavoidable. But purposefully spoilering new movies or books is such a dick move. 

If I'm in a public space I try not to loudly mention spoilers. Or if I know someone hasn't seen something I won't mention it. But if someone spoilers something for me, I don't really care (unless they were trying to be dicks). "
"I have to stop using Instagram because of this, I‚Äôve had major plot points of Avengers 4 spoiled because people leak posters, set photos, script stuff (and then write in huge font size about the spoilers from the script), etc.  I don‚Äôt understand people who go out of their way to purposefully spoil movies for themselves (and others by posting it)."
"I'll be honest, I don't really 'Invest' into movies before seeing them. I think I've gone in cold to most of the Avengers, Captian America, Thor Ragnarok, Etc. So, if I did see a spoiler, it wouldn't mean anything to me, so I wouldn't remember. My brain would just remember XXXX kills/marries/is YYYYY, and then forget. 

That being said, I think Ant Man has been out for a while. Alternatively, go see Captian Marvel/Whatever the next movie is with them, so they can't spoil it. Or tell them that they're an ass"
I hate spoilers too because it totally makes you not want to even see the movie. I don't get why a person would want to spoil something for everyone makes absolutely no sense.
"Spoilers don't bother me at all. People whining about spoilers on the other hand, especially when it's a very minor plot point, drive me nuts. "
"Ugh, I hate spoilers."
I see so few movies it hardly matters. Chances are if I hear a spoiler I was never gonna see the movie anyway.
"I also hate major spoilers for the obvious reasons but I also hate the more subtle ones in trailers. Like I wouldn‚Äôt know anything without watching them but when I do I know the atmosphere and parts of the plot. 
Not watching trailers for deadpool 2, Jurassic world and incredibles 2 was actually amazing"
"Friend: ""Did you watch that last episode?""

You: (About to respond with ""not yet"")

Friend: ""\[insert important character name\] died!""

You: ""You son of a \*\*\*\*\*!"""
"Spoilers don't bother me if I have no intention of experiencing that movie/book/game but if I do, I can't stand them.  A lot of the enjoyment I get out of things like that comes from being surprised by shocking moments.  But when you know ahead of time what is going to happen, it just isn't that remarkable anymore."
"Ah, now this is interesting. I‚Äôve read a similar post on some website a while back that raised a point like yours. It‚Äôs a nice way to look at it, because usually people don‚Äôt spoil specifically how, where, why, and when a certain plot point happens. It‚Äôs just like you said, usually a quick ‚Äúx dies‚Äù or something to that effect. 

Have you ever had a situation where a spoiler did affect your enjoyment, or someone did spoil something specifically for you and you got much less enthused about seeing a movie?"
That‚Äôs how I feel too. Spoilers have never bothered me. 
You‚Äôre definitely a good person for doing that. Thank you for being considerate. 
Do people spoil movies for you often? 
"Very fair point, and yeah anything old is fair game. I‚Äôve known the ending of the Sixth Sense for a decade and a half but still haven‚Äôt seen it. 

Good on you for not saying them loudly in public and being considerate. Thank you. "
"That‚Äôs fair. I think not investing into movies can be solid. I‚Äôve seen spoilers for certain TV shows and whatnot and I can‚Äôt remember them. Just harder when they are movies you care about beforehand. 

Sound advice and I appreciate the perspective. Thank you. 

Have you seen the new Ant Man yourself? "
"No one ever goes into detail about it so for me, it's fine, but i have had friends where they will physically run away from the conversation if even a hint of a spoiler comes up haha. "
"The Sixth Sense is one of my favourite films of all time! If you like spooky films I totally recommend it. I also knew the spoiler (because who doesn't) and I do kind of wish I could have watched it without knowing it. BUT it was cool to see how they hint at it. Anyway I always look up horror spoilers so it's not too scary. I know that sounds silly, I love horror, but I also want to sleep at night. The Sixth Sense is still one of my top 5 scariest. 

I can vaguely remember that when Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince was published, someone was going around the town centre shouting out the *biggest* spoiler until someone made them go away. Who would do that?! "
"Nope, and I didn't see the first one either. I did 'spoil' a Video game I was playing, but that's what I get for reading the Wikipedia of it"
"Ah, gotcha. What game was it? Did it end up impacting your enjoyment of it at all?"
"Life is Strange. And no, not really, partially because the ending is whatever I decide for it to be"
"Oh, nice. I‚Äôve started that game but never finished it. Actually, never played beyond the first episode. Do you recommend it? I am generally a fan of Telltale games and it felt pretty similar. Was the story pretty solid?"
"I liked it, but I'm not picky"
"My dad was extremely pissed about this banker he was working with.  He took out a massive loan, but used a pen with the disappearing ink.  He took $30k.  They sued.  They went to court.  Judge asked for the paperwork.  Banks lawyer handed them a stack of unsigned loan agreements.  Judge dismissed.  Dad walked away.

FYI you can't do this anymore, since everything is recorded electronically, but still."
I once opened all the bananas in my friend's apartment 
I once purposefully pissed on my friends floor next to the toilet when he was in debt to me. I don't think he noticed because he's a drug addict and his place was a mess anyway.
This is actually hilarious. Your mom's level of petty gives me life.
"My rear windshield washer is useless over 60 mph, the spray just misses my car entirely because of the wind.   When someone is being an asshole on the highway, especially if I am not in the passing lane and they are being really aggressive and tailgaity to try to get me to move out of their way, I'll use my rear windshield washer to spray them until they back off.  "
"I once had an argument with my brother in the morning. Fast forward to the evening when I went to brush my teeth, I realised that he had spray painted my toothbrush black smh"
"My housemates last year had a big argument about the washing up. Pretty run of the mill stuff; one of them was very clean & tidy and another never washed anything (they were both annoying to live with, in their own ways). Untidy housemate had gone weeks without washing anything and there were dirty plates, bowls and crap all over the kitchen. Tidy housemate took all the stuff and left it on his bed. There was loads of it, it smelled terrible, and of course he had to move it all before he could even sleep. A couple of us ended up helping him out.

Also I'm glad your mum got rid of that dude, he sounds like a giant douchebag."
"Your friend got what he deserved for having that devil berry in his house. Bananas are the greatest threat mankind has ever, or will ever, face. Good on your for doing your part in stopping the yellow menace! "
"Ha, that‚Äôs pretty good."
How dare you speak the banana's name in vain? Arrest this blasphemer!
At $10 a pop they truly are evil.
"What's your first language? I hear English is on the more difficult side to pick up, so how long did it take? I hope you enjoy being back at uni. :) "
"Hey, man! How you doing?"
"I'm free to talk too! Besides, I've experienced something like that when I was in uni"
What are you studying?
"I‚Äôm in a carride expected to take maybe an hour, so feel free to hit me up anytime!"
"I find it the other way around, back home there is nothing to do because all my stuff is in my university accommodation and all my friends in university too. Although you did say you had vacations where i'm assuming you went somewhere whereas i'm just at home doing nothing haha."
"Hindi is my first Language, its been almost 3-4 years since I become conscious of learning English"
"I am doing fine, thanks for asking, just a little lonely here which is making me homesick. "
"Ikr, it feels so lonely and sad when you had a great vacations and after that just classes of 5 months without very less holidays"
I am pursuing my Bachelors in Computer Science 
yeah Sure man ! 
"So, going to some party?"
"umm, hmm, by Vacations i do meant at homes and In my case, since i have almost no one i can say ""friend"" my laptop is lot to me. I feel good as long as it is with me"
Cool! Does your school teach in English or is it a class you take? Do you enjoy speaking the language? I hear foreign words can feel weird for someone to pronounce. 
"I'm bored and free atm, so feel free to talk!"
"It can get lonely, even though I lived with my aunt. What do you like to do? That can be your distraction"
"Yay, I want to do that too or EE it's on my grades to  decide that"
nah coming home from our summerhouse. have‚Äônt had any internet for days man
"I am in university and yeah we have Soft Skills class in which we perform Drama/acting, presentations etc but you see I am an introvert and hesitate to open in person"
"I see, thats great. So umm, are you a student too or a person with job?"
"Just redditing and anime , lol"
In which you are more interested?
EE is electrical Engineering right? thats cool too
"those must had been tough days, .. i guess grammatically i made some mistake here and conveying some different message from what i wanted to say"
I feel your struggle. Have you tried out much so far in the class? I don't think I would be comfortable doing it in class but acting and skits sound like a lot of fun. Are you comfortable being open in other situations? 
I'm a student in India. Where do you study?
"Yep, yeah it's cool and all but I guess CS will help me more to get out of the country."
"Where would you like to work big company, small company, freelancing....etc"
yeah. brought my old xbox 360 and played some old games tho so that was pretty fun
"I like being open in my friend group other than that I feel like my every word might become joke that others may use to make fun of me, i have habit of doubting myself"
are you a student or some service man?
Hey I am from India too ! I am studying at CU
"of course in a big company, and i was thinking of freelancing too lately"
but I am not sure If I have what I takes to get job in MNCs' or some big company especially when you are a fresher
"like good old days, so nostalgic"
"I've been out of college for almost two years now, though I know how it feels to be awkward around ""strangers"". I've met plenty foreigners who learned English so I've always had an interest in people who are similar. :)

Is it the way you speak or just overall? I've learned that personally that I'm my worst critic and that I'm often too hard on myself. I bet you would find plenty of people who would talk and not make fun of you. :) "
"Oh, that's cool. I'm in SRM."
Be confident on your skills more you are working towards getting your degree and that's great don't forget to make a lot of projects to prove that you will be useful for them and it doesn't have to be a big company there a lot of interesting startups looking for developers.
"yeah, was going on a bit of a nostalgia trip. played diablo 3 and borderlands. good fun"
"Yeah Thank You Rogue :) You know when speaking a language other than your first one, in my case the things i want to express doesn't come to my mind, like you see when speaking natural you can express yourself better. But when speaking English I find myself lost, about what to speak next, or how to say this, etc"
oh nice! heard about it a lot. so what are you studying?
"I can definitely understand that, you just don't have the natural vocabulary that you can use in your native language. From my inexperienced perspective I would try absorbing a lot of English entertainment such as books, TV shows, and films. Nothing too gimmicky so that you can pick up different expressions and mannerisms. I still haven't picked up a second language myself but I hope to in the near future. :) "
Computer science. How about you?
Yeah I hope too :D 
"same :), I am in 3 yr "
"Nice, man. I'm in 2nd year."
How is your college?
Thats nice !
"Pretty much average, nothing like special which I can boast about."
"I do have a similar story. When I was young I left my bike in my apartment balcony which was on bottom floor. One day my mom caught two foreign guys handing up the bike over the railing. But as my no-nonsense mother glares at them they promptly put it down and took the trash bags out, which we left on the side, as if they were doing a service. "
"Once I was trying to sleep when I could hear my lock being messed with. I jumped up and went to the door immediately. I didn't think to grab a weapon but I'm a big guy so I thought maybe that'll scare them. When I got to the door I could hear swearing on the other side. It wasn't a break-in attempt, just some drunk guy who forgot on what floor he lived. He was swearing because he thought his key was broken. I told him to fuck off and he did."
"Yep. I was home alone probably around 3-4 in the morning. I was half asleep when my dog started growling and her hair standing up on end, then I started hearing a bunch of banging from my back bedroom. I sent my dog in there, but I also had my gun as well. I called dispatch, and several cops rolled up and found a latter up against my back balcony "
"Whoa, OP, quick thinking!"
I had some drunk guys burst into my house once thinking it was their house (my dumbass forgot to lock it). It was pretty scary
It‚Äôs good home protection that‚Äôs for sure 
"That‚Äôs terrifying. Glad you fended them off man, maybe good idea to let your neighbours know as well if you live in a house? Might be a possibility that they‚Äôd come back to your neighbourhood and try their luck again."
r/LetsNotMeet has all kinds of stories like this. I'm glad you're okay OP.
"I was renting from a guy.  His brother was a severe alcoholic at the time and would get massively drunk.  He also would go in the living room and crank the stereo so loud the windows would crack and pop in sad country songs at 2 AM, so drunk he couldn't comprehend English.

One night I'm sound asleep.  He kicks my door in and starts threatening me with a knife saying I'm sleeping with his wife (I'm not, never met her). His brother ran from the other room and tackled him, which is good, because I was gonna shoot him.

He woke up and had no memory of it.  He didn't believe us until we showed him the security feed.  We threw him out the moment he could stand.  Literally chucked all his stuff in the driveway and said get out.

He had been posting about how God doesn't exist lately and how hard things have been for him.  I posted the video of the whole incident on his FaceBook feed asking how this behavior seemed right to him.  He was beyond pissed and lit up my Messenger feed with some seriously visceral stuff."
Must have been one hell of a glare.
Nice thinking. After this I feel like I should buy a gun or something besides a knife
Thanks homie
I live in an apartment complex. I emailed management and let them know what happened. 
Mom glares can have that kind of effect!
"Owning a firearm is a great investment, I highly recommend you educate yourself about them, buy one, and gain proficiency. "
"Only if you have the training, and only if you have a very clear understanding of gun law.  It's not unheard of for a burglar to break in and YOU end up in a cell."
"Damn man, I was just gonna say it‚Äôs probably safer in an apartment complex just because there are so many apartments in a building. Apparently not! I hope your neighbours haven‚Äôt been stolen from tonight though. Ouf."
Yeah guess I'll find out tomorrow if anyone was robbed. 
Keep us updated!
"thanks, i feel this way too. it's so wholesome, i really love it. how's your night been?"
I feel like its easier to talk through a screen
"Not great at all. A bunch of minor inconveniences that piled up and made me very upset to have gotten out of bed. In a nutshell I got poo on the carpet, went to the store barefoot and cut my foot on a rock and managed to burn noodles to a crisp. At least I got plenty of funny stories out of it to tell Reddit!"
Exactly this! I feel uncomfortable in social situations. I hate eye contact and I can never think of anything to say on the spot. Online it's different. I can take my time answering and I don't need to look anyone in the eyes. I'm not on the spectrum but it was suspected for a long time. Turns out I have a personality disorder that has many symptoms in common with autism. Go figure.
i'm sorry to hear it. i hope you can find some solace on here üíï
Being able to think a lot before posting really helps. Also autism is ok.
"Thank you! It's a good thing I can see humour in almost everything. It's kinda funny how all these things happened during the same day. If you want to read everything that went wrong, I made a post about it https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/8yz4ks/my_day_was_shit_how_was_yours/

I have hyperbolic writing style so it might seem I'm more pissed off than I really am"
"I have Schizotypal personality disorder which shares the social issues with autism but also comes with its own little fun symptoms such as hallucinations, paranoia and trust issues not to mention fragmented thoughts. It's kinda like if autism took meth."
"oh wow! you're a good story-teller. i laughed my ass off hahaha. have you ever read the children's a book ""alexander and the terrible, horrible, no good, very bad day? that's exactly what your story sounds like - just, the adult version. "
"Jeee, that can't be fun. How donyou cope?"
"I don't really read much, much less children's literature. I'm too impatient to read if I'm honest. I mainly just watch movies and series from my second screen while I play games on my first screen. Sounds like a funny book though!"
Pills and isolation mostly.
"I tried to take psychology in college but lost interest in the course itself. 
The way our brain functions and how all these chemicals come together just to function our bodies throughout the day is so interesting! "
Damn this is how I feel too. Psychology has always been a subject I‚Äôve been interested in too. However It‚Äôs likely I‚Äôm not going to be studying that for my future but it has always been something I loved searching up and learning up about 
"About a year ago my medication had a side effect and it nearly killed me. Since I was then deathly allergic to all psych meds and my now realistic fear of doctors I have to deal with my mental illness without it. So I started doing research into psychology and it branched into ethics and philosophy. If I was healthy enough to go to college that is what I would go for. So yes, I want to become the very thing I hate, and I find it so fascinating. "
Absolutely love reading and researching and learning about psychology. Sometimes it really trips me the fuck out but I love it ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
"I'm taking AP Psych next year too, really interested in knowing all the factors that help to explain our lives! I think that a lot of people could benefit from the knowledge of these patterns in human behavior- truly insightful stuff has come out of this research."
"I'm very interested in psychology but I have many gripes too.  The biggest is just how tenuous most of our knowledge is.  Much of the base of psychology are old studies and things people think might be true.  There's not a lot of hard data and even when studies are conducted they're oft poorly designed with tiny, non representative, sample sizes. Then people take this 6 participant study and try to act like it's some massive realization about humankind.  

Thinking about thinking is useful, getting an understanding for the methods we use is important.  However, we really need better methodology.  "
"People are complete enigmas. They might display a lot of the same patterns over time, but you just cannot predict human behavior. I work with HR data and a lot of the time people are like ""hey, what's this person gonna do according to what you've seen in the past?"" And we're like ""IT COULD BE ANYTHING"""
"I totally agree! I majored in psych in college, but honestly, I learned more from my therapist in 2 years then I did in all my psych classes combined."
"I love psychology! Currently reading a book of selected writings by Jung and it's both profound and fascinating

What have you learnt recently that totally shifted your perspective on how we think? "
Are you into podcasts? Check out Hidden Brian. It‚Äôs a super interesting podcast about psychology and sociology. Just a fun and accessible way to learn more!
"Man oh man, AP Psych is a lot. There are concepts that are complicated and obviously takes time to understand but once it clicks and you see those concepts play out in real life...its just cool, you know? Have fun with the course next year and don't stress yourself out too much."
"My similarly passionate interest in psychology led me to study the major in college - and I'll be going into a cognitive neuroscience PhD program next year! There's so much to enjoy about the topic, and I have such a hunger to learn it all and be a part of the discovery process. The brain is incredibly complex. 

If you like the atypical side of things, look up alien hand syndrome. If you like the clinical side, see if you can find an article about the default mode network in the brain & mindfulness meditation. And if you like biology, take a peek at some stuff about the anterior cingulate cortex! (It's my personal favorite part of the brain üòä)"
I'm afraid it's worse than that. I own this psychology degree. 
"For context: I minored in psychology, but did all the coursework it took to major in the class with the exception of a stat class. I didn‚Äôt major because I refused to repeat math classes to take the stat course I needed for the major. Psychology is definitively one of my passions, and I was a straight A kid in my psych classes. 

Psych is still a currently developing field. At it‚Äôs core, there‚Äôs still much to unearth in psychology, and current academia is evolving. I see a lot of people claiming psychology relies too heavily on Freud, and while it is true he‚Äôs covered in almost any class you‚Äôll take, it does not at all mean that psychology‚Äôs academia isn‚Äôt moving past him.  A few articles in google cannot possibly convey all the movements, discoveries, and studies that take place in the academic field. If you‚Äôre not making an effort to be intimately connected, most often, you don‚Äôt know.

That being said, psychology doesn‚Äôt have the answer to everything. People are always coming up with new theories and ideas behind why we behave the way we do, and the field is often fluid and in motion. Sometimes we loosely accept that this is the way people behave based on so and so study, and other times researches end up stumped because a participant does not respond in the way predicted. Only because the human mind is so varied. 

Psychology is definitely an interesting field. Exploring the reasons for why people act and think the way they do is an interesting endeavor. I love it. Some people are very simple to read, whereas others will always be a closed book as they‚Äôre just too self-aware to let you read them. But all in all, a very amazing topic. My only miff is how much its concepts get butchered by the online world. "
"I recommend that you check out [You Are Not So Smart](https://youarenotsosmart.com/podcast/), a podcast about psychology that's very accessible. There's a book as well, which comes recommended by Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian. Here's what he said:

> ‚ÄúEvery chapter is a welcome reminder that you are not so smart ‚Äî yet you‚Äôre never made to feel dumb.  You Are Not So Smart is a dose of psychology research served in tasty anecdotes that will make you better understand both yourself and the rest of us. You‚Äôll find new perspectives on your relationships with people you know, people you don‚Äôt, and even brands. It turns out we‚Äôre much more irrational than most of us think, so give yourself every advantage you can and read this book.‚Äù ‚Äì Alexis Ohanian"
What are some good places to start research if you have any specific places in mind? I‚Äôm going to be a TA for my developmental psych class this upcoming fall semester.
"I'm similar in that I like to talk with people about matters of life and human nature, often visiting subs like this just to see what people are going through or how they wish to offer insight and a glimpse into their psyche."
"YES. you sound just like me!!!! I became passionate about psyc when I was a sophomore in high school and read a book about the subconscious that was far too complex for me to understand fully at the time, but I was still so fascinated by the subject. I‚Äôve always been so interested in why people act the way they do. 

Now I‚Äôm going into my third year of college. I‚Äôm pursuing a degree in psychology and work as a supplemental instructor for an intro to psychology course at my university where I get to help students understand my fav subject ever. I‚Äôve taken a deep interest in severe mental illness and psychopathology and work in a research lab centered around schizophrenia. I‚Äôve learned SO much and the more I learn, the more I fall in love with psyc. It‚Äôs SO fascinating.  

With that all said, I hope you enjoy your AP psyc class & learn so much! "
"As much as i love psychology, I have not been able to focus during psychology classes. I really love being able to see someone act a way, and being able to analyse what it could mean, by comparing it to previous observations. It also can make for surprisingly fulfilling conversations."
I took ap psych in my senior year of high school it was good class and not too hard compared with the rest of the AP classes I enjoyed it. I took a political psych course last semester and boy was that ever depressing.
"I know right! It all works to make us who we are, and even a small change can have huge consequences."
I used to research so much about it. I want to use it to discover why I act like I do. It's kind of like an explanation for why I'm me.
"It really is fascinating, and there are so many ways that in branches off, that almost anybody can find something that interests them in it!"
It really is so fascinating because you can learn about yourself and others.
"Yep, I'm hoping to learn more about myself in this class, I think it could really help me."
Perhaps more people taking an interest in psychology could lead to better methods?
"I know you can't predict behavior, but psychology can help explain why they behaved how they did."
"I don't know tbh, I guess just random research on social and mental disorders got me interested. It kinda showed me how our psychology affects us so much."
I've never really watched a podcast before but I'm sure it's pretty easy. If I remember to I will when I have more time.
Thanks. I'm really excited to see if it changes how I see the world and how I see myself.
"Holy crap, that's awesome!"
"Interesting, this is something I might actually do, the book reading I mean. Would you happen to know how complex the book is? I'm only a junior in high school, so I'm not smart."
"I'm not even sure. All I know is I'm taking AP Psych this year, and that's where I'm planning to learn about it."
"Man I used to think about this as a child all the time, I hope you do well for your psychology AP though!"
"It really is! I find it useful to be self-aware of your own psyche to the best of your ability. One year ago I was diagnosed with the ""big bad"" schizophrenia and since I've been able to debunk or tear apart almost every aspect of it. As it turns out, I don't have schizophrenia. It was a miss diagnosis and I don't show enough signs of it. My new therapist is one of the only that I've liked and with him we're looking into every possibility. 

I wouldn't have figured that out if I didn't go digging! Now we're looking at D.I.D and Scrupulosity OCD in which the latter could be causing all of my extra anxiety/guilt because my ""self progress"" is also pulling away from this ""perfect"" mentality I hold myself to. "
"My curiosity about myself and people around me is boundless, I've done a fair bit of digging myself but I think coupled with my existential lines of self questioning it might definitely impact me more way than a regular class would."
That's the hope. From where I sit it seems that resources is often to blame.  It's expensive and time consuming to get thousands of disparate people to participate in a study.  Especially when a study of 12 college students gets you published. 
"It is audio only so FYI. If you have a IPhone, you can use the Podcasts app and search for the title. It‚Äôs easy to listen to on public transportation or while driving. I have tons I listen to throughout the day. On Android I think you can download the NPR one app since it‚Äôs an National Public Radio show. There are a ton of great ones. Invisiblia is another you may like with your interests."
"Try listening to the podcast first. The book is very readable, I think you should be fine."
"Thanks! I hope so too, if I like it and do well it could lead to so many more things."
"Yes, I've tried to research various things about how I feel and think to learn more about myself, but I have to be careful what I do because self-diagnosis isn't usually a good thing."
Then I'm glad you get to take it!
"That makes sense I guess. It's not really an excuse, but it's a reason."
"Interesting, I may listen to it, but if I do it won't be until next week. I'm leaving for camp tomorrow, and I want to use all the time I have beforehand very well."
"No, it's not. It can be dangerous to go looking for answers when there isn't even a real question. Both of the diagnosis we're looking at now *he* suggested and since he knows how little trust I have for doctors he doesn't mind me searching myself. When it comes down to an actual diagnosis I'm going to have to be tested and I'm fully aware I'm not capable of doing so. In fact, I'm on a waiting list for D.I.D. testing right now. 

What I am doing is trying to gather as much information as I can to take to my therapist. Things like death anxiety that can't be fixed with a good talk and a magic pill. It's like how I thought I was schizophrenic. I had to learn how to deal and control with what I was experiencing and having a basic understanding of *what it is* made dealing so much easier. "
Yeah.  There's still good work being done and you can glean insights from smaller studies but always take that stuff with a grain of salt. 
"Yep, it is good you're talking to someone professional."
"Right. I think both is important. Being self-aware of yourself enough to keep yourself in check, but also making sure you're not doing it alone. After being on one side of it and seeing how intrested I am in the discussion I'm considering studying to be part of the other side. "
That's great! Have fun in whatever you decide to do.
"Born in '95, grew up listening to 60's through 80's music because that's what my parents listened to.

There's actually almost no style of music I won't listen to, and there's a song I like from pretty much every genre. "
"My teenage years were the 2000's, and I was mostly listening to Rise Against, Paramore, Puddle of Mudd, Sum 41, and Hoobastank."
"I was born 1995, mainly listened to whatever was playing in the early 2000's. But when I got to around 13 years old I started discovering and listening to music from the 60's-80's mainly, still do now."
"Mid-late 90‚Äôs alternative/heavy rock/metal. Wouldn‚Äôt change it for the world. Bush, Metallica, Offspring, smashing pumpkins. "
"Early 2000s, but still a fair bit of 90s thanks to my older sisters. I was born in 1995. "
"Born in the late 60's, really grew up to 80's rock: Def Leppard, Bryan Adams, Bruce Springsteen, Elton John, Survivor, Tina turner.

Slowly transitioned into new country the past 15-20 years."
"Born in 1998, had my childhood in the 2000s so I would listen to whatever was on the radio, on the MuchMusic channel, or some Arabic music that my parents had on cassette tapes dating from as far back as the 70s since they're from Sudan.

Nowadays I still listen to music from 2000s and a bit from 2010s but on occasion I listen to stuff from the 90s, 70s, maybe 80s."
"You can't beat MC Hammer - can't touch this!
80's kid for the win"
"Born in the 90's, and I mostly grew up on 70's and a bit of 80's. Lots of stuff like ELO, Fleetwood Mac, Bob Seger, T. Rex, etc. Formed the basis of my taste in music today. Thanks, mom."
These comments make me feel super old. Thanks a lot. 
"From the 50's onward basically, which is funny because I was never into classic Rock and Roll when I was younger."
"i was born in 2004 and i pretty much just listened to whatever my parents played for a long time, which ranged from classical to alternative. but thats not what i listen to now. for the most part, i like 90s and 2000s alternative rock and britpop and some electronica"
"60s stuff, since my bus driver listened to it all the time.  I had the same bus, same driver for five years.  She was cool."
"My parents listened to the big band era stuff, Dorsey brothers, Glenn Miller, Artie Shaw, etc.  They had a full, rich sound with brass, woodwinds and the like.  Maybe that's why I ended up in the brass section in band.  They also loved classical.

My older brother & sister listened to the early rock (Elvis) and the stuff that blended with my parents melodic/romantic lines.  Oh, and the doo wap, Philly street corner stuff.

In HS it was more early Beatles, Paul Revere, Momas and Pappas, Dylan, Joan Baez.  All in all a good mix.  Being in band had me playing the Classics and the Dance Band, Big Band stuff.  Oh, and of course a full complement of marches for the football halftime shows and parades.

I guess because of my roots, Celtic was a thread through all of our lives.  Sunday night was for the extended family ""home made"" music night, with whatever assortment of instruments turned up to play.

  btw, I'm still growing up."
"I was born in 2000, but I mostly listened to 90s music through my parents, since my mom was a teenager in the 90s. But also I grew up listening to late 2000s-10s music since I‚Äôm a teenager. Now my music probably ranges 140 years."
"Born in 1990; cut my teeth on my parents' Beatles tapes and my brothers' alternative rock/grunge CDs. Thanks to that, rock will always be my favorite genre. Later, as I started discovering music on my own, my second-favorite genre turned out to be female singer-songwriters. Still, despite all the other genres I've been exposed to, I'll always be a lifelong rocker."
"Born in ‚Äò01, definitely 80‚Äôs music. It‚Äôs pretty much all that my parents listen to and I guess that it rubbed off."
"One year ahead of you (2000). Listened to Queen and Billy Joel almost exclusively before I started to discover my own. I liked basically just classic rock with a little bit of dubstep and pop in the early teens
Eventually I realised that I was never completely satisfied when playing guitar, and when I played enter sandman for the first it was bliss. And that‚Äôs when I started to like metal as well as the other genres "
"I like you.

95 is best year.

"
Good choice...
What were your favourite Billy Joel and Queen songs?
We pretty much have the exact same answer haha
Picking a favourite Queen song would be like picking a favourite child. But my favourite Billy Joel song is we didn‚Äôt start the fire
"Awww yeah, ‚Äò95 awesome music twinsies!"
"Same with Billy. Too many good Queen songs, but 2 of the best are [We Will Rock You](https://youtu.be/-tJYN-eG1zk) and [Don't Stop Me Now](https://youtu.be/HgzGwKwLmgM).

I think Queen has produced more good songs in their career than any other band or artist."
I agree. So where you from liamsjtaylor?
"UK. You?

OMG WHAT IF IT TURNS OUT WE'RE IN THE SAME CITY üòÇüò±"
"I just had a family reunion and met 6 new people! It was a really nice evening and we had a barbecue, and then we played poker afterwards which this one person kept getting stupidly lucky in. 

There was also a guy who just graduated university who went to the same school as me (who just graduated high school) and we had a nice little conversation comparing teachers and their stories.

All in all a nice and fulfilling Saturday. "
"Dude, roller skating sounds fun! 
Hopefully those walls weren‚Äôt hit at too fast of a pace!!

Have you tried snowboarding? 

Today I went to the gym, watched two PTA films (Inherent Vice and The Master), and now I‚Äôm reading Capote‚Äôs In Cold Blood while my cat scans my ceiling for the flies she‚Äôll never reach cause she‚Äôs a shrimp. "
"Hope you did not 'break a leg' 

A teacher was teaching maths to 7year olds asked her students, if there are 8 birds sitting on  a fence. The farmer took a shotgun and fired at one. How many birds would there be left? "
"I went and saw Ant-Man with a really close friend of mine. It was really funny and the special effects were cool.

I'm really sad though because the more I hang out with her, the more I miss going on dates and having a significant other. I was gonna ask her out on a legit date, but I don't think she's interested in me like that. I'm trying to force myself to stop thinking about her that way, but I just want someone to hug and cuddle. The warmth of another person's contact is what I miss the most of all. I hate that I can't get her off my mind. 

I have had no luck with dating apps, and I'm not good at meeting new people. It's exhausting. I've never been one to see someone and just say, ""I really want to be their friend."" I usually become friends with someone because I crack a stupid joke and then we start talking. But it's really difficult for me to meet people that I can take interest in because I mostly work with highschoolers. 

I've got crippling loneliness tonight. But i know I'll get through it. I always do. Never gets easier, though."
"My day was shit basically. I wrote about it here https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/8yz4ks/my_day_was_shit_how_was_yours/ but in a nutshell I lost poo in my carpet, cut my foot on a rock and burnt noodles to a crisp.

I play the electric guitar but I have this weird habit of curling my thumb around the fret bar to play the low E string. It's generally discouraged because it offers no advantages over regular playing and can actually limit you when trying to learn more advanced techniques. I wish I 'd known that before I learned to play like that...  I'm completely self-taught so I'm very ignorant when it comes to a lot basics, but luckily hobbies aren't really meant to be taken that seriously anyway."
"Always wanted to do either roller or ice skating. I've heard they look easy but are really hard the first time you try.

I'm currently just sitting at home browsing Reddit. It's raining, which is good. I love rain. It would be nice to listen to music or maybe watch something, but I have earwax dissolvents in my ears and they make everything sound muffled."
"I‚Äôve noticed I‚Äôm the same way. When I hang out with close friends and people I genuinely like I get sad when it‚Äôs over.  I always want to be talking to someone or be hanging out with someone. 

I went and got brunch with a friend in the morning, it was spending time with her and talking about how our summers are going. 

It was a Saturday and I felt like going out but I‚Äôm a cheapskate who works too many hours ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø "
I just came back from the trip and miss a few things already. I had a good time though
"I'm sad to hear you feel down.
My day is just beginning, it's morning were I am. Right now I'm just playing some games on my PS4. 

Anything you want to talk about specifically?"
My friends cheat too much at Monopoly and it‚Äôs starting to make me think about all the times they cheated and it makes me start to dislike them since honesty and staying true are the qualities I respect the most in a human being 
"Lmao I used to roller skate and never learned how to stop properly so I'd just do this weird slide thing? If i was ever going at a fast enough speed, i'd fall down trying to do that. Ah good old days üòÇ "
Aww. I never had a family reunion before. It sounds like a lot of fun though! 
"It‚Äôs my second time roller skating. I‚Äôm not very good at it, but because I use to ice skate, I think I picked up on it pretty quick. "
Zero! All the birds would get scared and fly away. Fun question :)
"I never seen ant before, but I wanted to see ant man and the wasp. I hope i don‚Äôt get confused I I watch the sequel first though. 

It‚Äôs understandable to feel that way. It‚Äôs really tough :( 

I‚Äôm not very good at meeting new people to be honest. I‚Äôm better at sticking to people I already know and talked to. If I ever meet someone new, it‚Äôs because they approached me first and somehow decided I was worth sticking with. 
"
"I have a similar situation, I find it hard to meet new people too and especially hard getting contact details."
"Ohh wow, that‚Äôs a lot of build up that is added to your day. One bad thing lead to another and it kept piling up. I can imagine being frustrated. 

Nice! It‚Äôs good to have a hobby. I don‚Äôt have the greatest patience when I comes to teaching myself, so I can never teach myself anything."
It‚Äôs really hot where I‚Äôm at so rain sounds super nice. :)
"It‚Äôs weird for me because i don‚Äôt really want to physically talk, but I want the presence of someone there. 

Brunch sounds good! "
"What type of games are you playing?

I can talk about anything, really. I‚Äôm not really good at starting conversations."
Niiiiice! Is it something you think you‚Äôll be sticking to?
Glad you that made you smile. 
"The second one has a few callbacks to the first and several pre-established characters, but you could probably watch it without feeling too lost, I think."
"I mostly just try to learn songs be ear until I get frustrated. I do like to play Rocksmith though, that game's cool."
"I understand completely. Sometimes it feels like whenever I want to hang out with someone, I need to have sometime planned but I just love chilling and having someone nearby and feeling thier presence"
"I only did it for fun, so i don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs something I‚Äôll be doing on a regular basis"
"I'm not watching it, football games send me to sleep, I'm just watching live text commentary on the BBC Sport website."
"It's a great match so far. I don't have a major dog in the fight, but I'm pulling for Croatia as well."
"Baby is napping, hubby is making me breakfast while I watch and it‚Äôs 1 all! Rooting for Croatia as well. "
"I'm not gonna spoil you what's happening, but match is incredible, try to avoid knowing result and watch the record.

I'm rooting for Croatia too, even if they kicked Russia out of tournament. First, they won against England that allowed us to play Euro2008. Then, it's just a friendly nation."
"I'm not into sports at all, but I'm from France, so my family and friends wanted to watch the final. If I wasn't living in France, I wouldn't really care about the final result, I would just be happy for the winner since it's a big competition. But living here, I'm glad we won because everyone is gonna be happy for a while and the news will be about our victory instead of people killing each other. Even if I'm not a sport fan, it makes me smile to hear people cheering and clapping in my building. "
I didn't watch. I hardly watched any of the World Cup.
I hope they win
What's the score right now? 
im just against france so i guess im on your side too
"40 minutes, 2-1.

1-0 autogoal, 1-1 very good shot, 2-1 penalty.

Who leads... Let's keep it secret =)"
Actually I was hoping for Belgium to reach the finals but France defeated them so I'm rooting for Croatia
"At the end of the match, plz tell me the score and who wins too"
Same! I have friends in Antwerp and was so bummed when they lost. 
4-2 France. Sadly :(
"Oh well.... Both were deserving teams... It'd have been something if Croatia had won...

And thnx for the update, friend! "
Every moment my wife and I have together without obligation or distraction 
"A few weeks ago, I was at this event at this small punk/bar venue. The DJ was blasting Emo music all night, and everyone was just thrashing and screaming along to the music. There's so much energy in the air it was almost intoxicating. But then, at the end of the night, the lights go off.. and then a few white spotlights turn on as the first few bars of ""Welcome To The Black Parade"" came on...those first few piano notes. 

The room goes silent; everyone stops and just smiles at each other. And then, by some silent cue, a room of strangers start swaying together and singing their hearts out.

Still fills me with warm happiness. "
"Today, cuddling with my one year old curled up on top of me on the couch. Just watching her little face as she sleeps and soaking in the moment."
I met a lady on tinder a couple of months ago. A couple of days ago I went to her house to take care of her because she‚Äôs feeling under the weather. She was watching me cook from the living room. After a few minutes she walked in and squeezed me from behind. I turned around. She gave me a kiss then layed her head on my chest. Then we had soup.
"The ""Hey man, from the next month you're promoted"" moment.

And not exactly moment, but my trip to Hellfest was full of perfect moments."
"I was able to get away to go grocery shopping by myself (no toddler). I got myself a coffee and was able to get groceries without much stress. Then after getting home & putting the groceries away, my son crawled on my lap and just gave me the biggest grin. It made me smile so wide and my heart melted.

I‚Äôm with my son 24/7 minus the usual 4-5 hours a week my husband takes him to the park. But my husband recently injured himself & couldn‚Äôt drive. It‚Äôs been so hot and we can‚Äôt be home for my sons nap, so this week has been me in public (where there is AC) with an overtired toddler and driving my husband around to physical therapy appointments.

I needed some sort of break. I was really tired of trying to entertain a toddler while cleaning & prepping food (I usually do this when husband takes him out). We also all share a bedroom and my son wakes 4-7 times a night. So when I say I‚Äôm with my son 24/7 I really mean it, and I feel ‚Äúon call‚Äù constantly.

Not trying to turn this negative, but just giving an explanation as to why this shopping trip was so perfect! Haha. My husband also took our son to the park before hand. So I was able to get ready without getting interrupted. Then getting a coffee and grocery shopping. It was perfect! They had a great time without me as well. No mom guilt of him crying for me as I was away.

Also, he‚Äôs not taking his nap today, so he should be going to bed early and my husband and I can watch a movie. I may have to go cuddle my son back to sleep in the middle of it, but I‚Äôm soooo excited to hang out with my husband!!! Our 10 year anniversary is coming up in a week and we have no money to get each other or do anything, but I don‚Äôt care. I just love spending time with him."
"A friend of mine bought a dog on a whim, ohhhh about 16 months ago. He's an Anatolian Shepherd, once upon a time they were war dogs in the middle East. I don't do it enough, but going over there to walk that dog is just perfect. He's not mine, he doesn't know he's getting walked everyday. But going over to see that big, 125 pound baby? He'll stand by the gate just hoping I walk him. Grabbing his leash, one I gave to his owner, and just seeing him light up and get airy between the brain is such a happy thing "
Got a perfect score on a project worth 15% of my grade. Expected like a B-
Mine is wrestling related and a bit long-winded but it was absolutely beautiful. A woman won a belt that was a long time coming.
"I spent a week at a close friend's house and came home at noon today. On the way home, we got lost and spent half an hour driving around in the backwoods trying to find the house. I turned on some of Johnathan Young's Disney Metal on my phone and we just acted silly and laughed all the way there. I also had a melting Frosty and it was dripping all over my shirt while I tried in vain to keep the cup steady. It was awesome. 

(edited for clarity)"
Being caught under the rain during a barbecue and running towards shelter like a little kid. 
"meeting an absolute stranger and the shock and disbelief you can feel when it turns out you not only are very alike. but how even a stranger can quite literally ""see"" you. look right into you. more real and genuine than someone you've known all your life in person. I won't offer any distinct examples. but what I'm saying is how experiencing such a thing, can honestly give you new eyes on life. it can make you question everything. and a firm reminder to never assume things about strangers. everyone, including you, deserves a fair, unbiased opportunity to put their best foot forward before you settle on a presupposition or view point on just who you believe them to be"
"This week has been very full of perfect moments with my love. We are very in sync this week. It started last week, we went away for the weekend for his birthday. One of the first perfect moments was a few beers in sitting in our cabin and just rambling to each other about our beliefs and goals. I love talking to him so much. "
"I got my final classification back from university, got into some film festivals and won some startup startup space all in about 24 hours about a month ago. All good, all fairly daunting."
"Mine was last night. I was cuddling with my man friend smoking a blunt and I looked out the window to see the rest of the sunset. It was just a little sliver of sunset because the curtains were almost closed but that didn't ruin it. It was 10:13pm and the sun was setting right below the horizon so it was really blue at the top of the sky and this faint yellow/orange. I just stared at that image for 2 mins straight, of course with the sun going down the colors changed with in the two minutes but it was beautiful. Perfect for me. "
"Looking as my S O wakes up in the morning. He opens his eyes and stares up. Then he turns to me and says "" Hey """
"You mean not having the kids around on your day off? 

Anything you define as a perfect moment. That sounds very lovely "
"That must‚Äôve been so fucking surreal! I love singing along especially MCR! I‚Äôve also had that almost same moment! I also listen to punk/rock/alternative and love going to those bars. 

I remember being in a similar bar where the last song  was Closing Time by Semisonic and everyone is just drunk, happy, and singing their lungs out as we were leaving. It was amazing! 

"
Isn‚Äôt it funny how you can never get tired of staring into their faces!
"Now that is quite something! The moment must have been very precious moments. Better enjoy it before she gets into her terrible 2‚Äôs! 

My nephew used to do that to me and it becomes one of my highlights after a long day at work. I can‚Äôt imagine how happy you must‚Äôve felt!"
"Late congratulations to you! I‚Äôve heard of Hellfest and it sounds really fun!

I‚Äôm going to VELD next month... I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm expecting but staying postive about it. "
Hellfest is amazing.
"This is so wholesome I love it! I‚Äôm glad you enjoy grocery runs because I loathe it as a single male im a huge city HAHA! 

Advance 10 Year Anniversarry to you both! I believe you don‚Äôt need a gift... just spend it with someone you truly love from the bottom of your heart! Thank you for sharing your moment! I hope you‚Äôll have many many more in the future! "
That sounds nice! Is it a local wrestling match? I used to wrestlw back in HS days but lost touch of it when I got into an accident. Didn‚Äôt have the weird ear tho!
"This is great! May I ask why you spent a week at your friend‚Äôs house? And how did he get lost in his own neighborhood, for thirty minutes!?"
"I love this! I think I know where you are going with this and I love it! Haha!

Meeting a complete stranger and getting to know them is always amazing. I could never get tired of it, just YET!"
There are a couple of songs that can turn a room full of strangers into their best friends. Pop punk is great for that. I live for moments like that.
"Not my style of music, but anyway, openairs are always great."
Definitely! One of the best experiences in my life.
This might/is going to sound a bit mental but it was Women's Pro-Wrestling from Japan. I have been following it for around 4 years. Religiously.
"No no, she was bringing *me* home lol. She had to drop me off at my aunt's house and it's a bit buried in the woods, and I don't know the way well, especially coming from the opposite direction I usually do. 

I was just hanging out. She lives a few hours away, so when I visit I stay for a while. We sat around the whole time playing video games and watching cheesy anime haha"
"I know what you mean man. I love it! I‚Äôm actually playing the song right now and I‚Äôm so pumped haha! I wish another wave of punk would come back but high unlikely üòÇ

"
Same. I watched Pig Destroyer and their was a guy in the pit upside down. Nobody was messing with him. He was just upside down.
Haha! We each have our own hobby and likes. Nothing mental man! 
A woman who is the head of a small group had a belt for months and fought off all challenges. When her time to walk away from the company came she issued a final challenge and her second in command who the current champion had trained from a junior and worked with very closely finally beat her after many unsuccessful attempts and ascended as the new champion going forward. It felt significant you know? Like you were witnessing something special happening. The apprentice surpassing the master type stuff.
Wall of text too long and my eyes too tired. Can I get a tldr? Lol :) 
"TL;DR : Basically moved around in my last years of high school, tried several times for university without success, is looking at army or border patrol posts. All in a 7 year period. What about you?"
"I changed schools twelve times in ten years moving households about 7 of those so I know the feel. Are you aiming too high for uni or just can't make the cut? I considered armed forces myself when I was getting out of high school though I couldn't quite agree with how it's used in a general sense my my country and decided not to join. (and I'm allergic to bullets XD)

My life has been chaotic out of high school but nothing too bad. What do you want from adult life? "
"I had high 90‚Äôs average grades in senior year, so i rightly thought i could manage university. Only problem was that those grades were obtained while i had a very strict and organized routine, which completely fell apart in university when i was by myself. As of now, im still searching for my path in life. Border patrol or law enforcement are the paths that seems most natural to me, but i keep an open mind. Main thing i currently want is find something that can make me live a good life (not necessarily money-wise)."
"Ah gotcha, I had a similar issue when I transferred into college myself. Dropped out the first year and went back 2 years later to complete my 2 year degree then dropped out again when trying for my 4 year. Have you considered moving into the general workforce? I recently moved into a position with low responsibility and decent pay so that I can recoup and figure things out. What are some things important to you? "
"I currently am in the general workforce, working in a gas station. I love it, but its a dead end job, without any prospects of advancements. Minimal wage as well, so thats not viable. The most important thing would be to be able to enjoy life, stay happy. I couldnt last a month in a high pressure job (sales for example), because it would suck the life out of me. I tried it, lasted 2 weeks before quitting."
"I couldn't stand minimum wage. üòÖ I was lucky enough to find a low pressure job that pays decent, I'd recommend trying to do the same if there is a large enough job market in your area. Sales sucks which is a position I recently left after four months. Finding your passion is asking too much for the average person so my goal is to do something I'm relatively good at to pay for things that I enjoy. Are you making time for yourself at the moment? "
"yeah, i am making time for myself. I actually dont need to find my passion to work, as long as the job is stimulating and pays enough that i can survive on it decently (dont need to work crazy hours/a second job to pay rent and food)."
"A book I read recently that I can't recommend enough is Furiously Happy by Jenny Lawson. It's a weird, hilarious and inspiring autobiography of sorts. 

Another recommendation I have is Zoo City by  Lauren Beukes. It's listed as science fiction; a good read! 

Finally, Watership Down by Richard Adams is a book my dad gave me as a kid. We had a lacking relationship so it holds a special place in my heart. "
Did you always like reading? It‚Äôs a serious question because I kinda wanna to get into it.
"Currently reading The Hitman's Guide to Housecleaning by Hallgr√≠mur Helgason. I have to admit my reading habits have been lacking lately, because of my current obsession with Japanese movies and series. Still, reading is not a habit I'm bound to lose, and I know it'll pick up again."
"Right now I'm reading the Fearless series by Francine Pascal and The Morganville Vampire series by Rachel Caine. Both of them are kinda cheesy in the best way possible and have some sarcastic/witty humor threaded in with some action and well rounded characters. They are also really quick reads and I'd suggest them if you feel like you need a brain break from the classics.


Speaking of classics...my favorite authors are F. Scott Fitzgerald, Kurt Vonnegut Jr., Leo Tolstoy, and Jane Austen.


My favorite young adult authors are John Green, Sarah Dessen, Cassandra Clare, Tahereh Mafi, Veronica Roth.


Rupi Kaur's  Milk and Honey is a great book of poetry. Y the Last Man is a graphic novel series that I also recently started and fell in love with. "
"Right now I‚Äôm reading The Outsider and working on the Harry Potter series. This summer I‚Äôve went through some really good books you should check out:

Anything by Kurt Vonnegut like Slaughter House Five and The Sirens of Titan.

Ready Player One

The Dark Tower series 

And Fahrenheit 451

All really good books of varying genres.  "
Ever read The Lovely Bones? One of my personal favorites.
That's great. I don't have a goal set but read/listen to a bunch of books every year. Right now I'm in the middle of Don Quixote and it's the funniest book I've read since Catch-22.
"I absolutely loved the Hunger Games trilogy. I don't know if it's for everyone, but they really are the best books I've ever read, and I got through them so quickly."
"I'm rereading Cold Mountain right now. Pretty good. 

I usually like classics. "
"If you are looking for extremely interesting non-fiction books, I have a few recommendations for you. 

Nudge by Richard Thaler who recently won a Nobel price in economics for his work on behavioural economics. 

Naked Economics by Charles Wheelan is a really good and easy to understand introduction to how the economy works and how you can use this understanding to improve your (financial) life.

The above mentioned books are well written with a unique wit and humor. And therefore certainly, very entertaining! The following are very interesting but are more scientific -- for the lack of a better word.

Antifragile by Nassim Taleb is a wild ride through a variety of topics which serve to illustrate Taleb's notion of ""antifragile"".

The Dictator's Handbook: Why Bad Behavior is Almost Always Good Politics by Bruce Mesquita. For a different perspective of why politics works the way it does. "
"What a fantastic variety of titles- I'll look into each of these, the autobiography in particular piques my interest!"
"Yes, I have :) I'm an English teacher now, and have lost the habit of reading for fun, but I'm trying to make more time for it because reading is so therapeutic, relaxing, inspiring... I love it. I'd love to make some recommendations if you want. What are your interests?"
"Ooh, what do you like from Tolstoy? I've never read him but always wanted to. "
Adding it to my list!
"I LOVE Don Quixote. One of my all time favorites, easily. Do you listen to books in your home or in the car? I want to try audio books but don't know if I could focus.  "
"Yes!!! I was on the edge of my seat reading them, and that was when I was in my early 20s - it was refreshing to have a trilogy so absorbing. Thank you for the response!"
I've never heard of it. What genre is it? 
"The autobiography is so good, it had me laughing until I hurt. The book addresses her mental illness which in itself is no laughing matter but her writing style and outlook are refreshing. It's inspiring, eye opening and so much more. It has also helped me see my own, similar situation in a new light. I hope you read and enjoy it! "
"Psychology, philosophy, and music are things that come to mind honestly. I‚Äôm open to anything though. "
Anna Karenina is one of my favorite books of all time. I own War and Peace but have yet to tackle that beast. Most people have told me it doesn't even compare to Anna Karenina so I'm hesitant to start it. 
"By the time I'm finished with it, it'll probably end up high on my favorites list too. 

I listen to something every time I get a chance to, mostly when I'm on the bike going to the university or at my dorm at night.

If the story is interesting, a good narrator will never allow you to lose focus. Listen to some of your old favorites on audio first as that will make it easier to get into the new medium and you're likely to end up enjoying them more than you did on your first reading. :)"
"If you're into Star Wars, I could recommend some Star Wars books. But this interest isn't held by that many people, so I doubt you'd want to read them."
"It's a historical novel. It was made into a movie but I haven't seen the movie so I don't know how they compare. Charles Frazier has a way with descriptive writing and can really paint a picture in sometimes graphic detail. It covers some very heavy topics... war and PTSD and desertion, but it's good."
"I'd recommend two to you: Man's Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl, and The Ocean at the End of the Lane by Neil Gaiman. One is nonfiction, the second is Fantasy. Both are short, but are loaded with meaning. "
I love the films but never explored the books. I'd be willing to try one out! 
"Ok, so far I haven't read any of the ones that are considered ""great"", but I know what the fanbase thinks, so I can tell you some of those.

Lost Stars is a sort of romantic book that's about two people who are in love, but one's a rebel and one's an Imperial. You see the Galactic Civil War (the war from the original films) from their perspectives. Almost everyone who reads it loves it.

Bloodlines is about Leia after the original movies but before the new movies. It shows us some things about the New Republic, the group that got destroyed in the new movies, and sets up the corruption in it and why Leia built the Resistance. Again, most people who read it really like it.

This one is both loved by the fans and my personal recommendation. I haven't actually read it, but it's about my favorite character in Star Wars, and my username is actually named after him. The book is called Thrawn. He's not in any of the movies, but he's still a fan-favorite character. He's an Imperial Grand Admiral who's an alien from outside of the galaxy, and he's incredibly intelligent, which is why he rose up the ranks and is so loved. He has no force abilities, but his intelligence allows him to win almost every battle. It's next on my reading list, and again, almost everyone loves it, so I have to recommend it.

I'd say those three are books that are good starting places for anyone not versed in the lore, and they're all very well written too."
Excellent.  THANK you for the input- I think I'll check out the Leia one first! How cool!
"Make sure to tell me what you think. I haven't read any of these, so I'll be curious to hear if you liked them."
"Yes. Shoot them an email letting them you you're still interested, and you wanted to check in with them to see if you were still being considered for the role. "
"It's okay to ask, just don't pester them. They'll often say something like, ""We have your resume on file and we'll let you know."" Which sucks, but it is what it is."
"I‚Äôm a hiring manager. It‚Äôs absolutely ok to reach out and inquire. 
Just say that you are following up on the interview you had with (interviewer‚Äôs name) on (date). Ask if they have made a decision as to who will fill the position of (position applied for). Say that if not, you are still very much interested. 

No matter the response, reply with ‚Äúthank you.‚Äù

If no response, they filled it with someone other than you. "
"Ok. I will do it. But, i dont know what to say.

Edit: i am gonna message the person on facebook since said person ask me thru facebook before"
Imho via FB messanger is quite unprofessional. I'd call directly.
"You can put exactly what i wrote abive...

Hello (name),

I just wanted to check in with you about the (job title) position I interviewed for on (date). Am I still being considered for the role?

Thank you,
(Your name)"
"Yeah, but, i dont have another way of contact."
I usually copy paste but i need to convert this first in my language. Thanks for the guideline
"Maddie, the truth is that there's nothing wrong with you. I'm sorry that you have to go back into the closet. I'm not LGBT, but I support your right to be who you are and hate that you have ever had to feel shame about it. I'm glad you had a good week, and I hope that soon you will get to be you every day <3"
"Thank you! If this is anything to go by, I can‚Äôt wait!"
I went to one wedding shower and it was a small affair with great people. The host made up games about the happy couple and we had a blast. I hope you have a good experience this time around and that you don't get hurt from the constant eye rolling! üòÖ
"Wedding showers are parties. I don't like parties, and basically don't go to them. "
Well thanks. I did some exercises yesterday with my eye to prevent eye roll strain. Hopefully that helps.
The pizza that is currently on it's path to consumption
"There's a little bookshop on my street that also sells trinkets handmade by the nearby Shaker community. I bought a mid-sized bottle of Shaker-made rosewater from there for $3.00 like two years ago, as a gift to my mom for Mother's Day. Since then, I've discovered that rosewater is good for *everything.* You can put it in your bath to make it smell nice, you can mix it with shampoo to make your hair smell nice, you can put it in your humidifier to make *everything* smell nice, you can make all kinds of pastries with it, you can put it in soda water with some sugar and lime or cucumber to make a fizzy drink, you can make all kinds of pastries with it, you can put it in frosting....... It also makes an amazing casual gift to someone for pretty much any occasion. I've even discovered a bit of a secret recipe where I put a few tablespoons of honey, a few tablespoons of rosewater, a few cut-up orange peels, a dash of vanilla, and like half a cup of water in a saucepan and simmer it in the evening. It fills the whole house with the wonderful, wonderful unique smell that I just love. And then, when you're done simmering, you can just take the honey out (the water having boiled off) and use it as a flavoring, since it's now infused with the tastes of rose, vanilla, and citrus. It makes me so happy, and I think if they ever stopped making it I would die. Or at least be sad and smelly."
"This probably wouldn't help you at all because it's pretty specific and only used for one thing, but the rechargeable battery for my Xbox One controller was a great thing to buy. I've had it for a while, and it makes playing so much easier because I don't have to change batteries anymore."
"Awhile back,  I treated myself to a handmade wood pen on a whim.  I've come to adore the pen - it's aesthetics,  the weight when you hold it,  how it writes,  and the fact that the ink cartridges are replaceable. And the best part?  I've had it over a year and I haven't lost it,  which is no minor feat in my life.  I lose everything. And it makes me feel really fancy when I use it. "
"My sister bought me a coiled Aux cord, thinking it would do a better job than the 3 or 4 months my other cords would last. My phone kept falling to the floor and ruining the cable when I had to make sudden stops, but I've now used this cable for at least 3 years daily. Legitimately one of my best birthday gifts ever. "
"That mini toolkit fromIKEA. Several different heads for a screwdriver handle, hammer, cover for said hammer,..."
"My Utilitea kettle that I use for brewing tea, have had it for quite a while and it still works great. Was sort of a mid priced kettle with minimal plastic contact. Ended up buying a second one, not because it broke but because I just wanted two."
"A $10 socket spanner with Phillip head/flat head and Allen key attachments. 

Originally got it to use the attachments in my drill but I now get it out no matter what I‚Äôm building. Saves a ton of time and pain when using the Allen key part. "
"I bought a dog water bowl that fills itself automatically by being connected to a water line. It stops filling and fills automatically and can be cleaned within seconds by just wiping it with a rag. 

Also inherited a water distiller that I hooked up to a small tap at my kitchen sink and has saved me from purchasing the many and heavy 18.9 Litre bottles every month. 

Of course it helps being handy and installing these myself but they have definitely made a positive impact on my life.

I have a pair of hearing protection ear muffs (not sure what the common name is for them). It‚Äôs what people use to protect their ears when shooting guns or operating heavy machinery. I can‚Äôt remember the cost but it was probably less than $20. I‚Äôve had them for a couple years but only recently realized they can contribute to my quality of life. I‚Äôm a bit of an HSP (highly sensitive person) and therefore get overstimulated by the end of the day. I can‚Äôt remember why but one day I put them on while lying in bed. I‚Äôve been doing it daily ever since. It is the best source of stress relief for me. It only takes like 15 to 20 minutes. The best way to explain how it makes me feel is it‚Äôs like having a brain massage. I‚Äôm not exaggerating. I wish I had discovered that 20 years ago. 
"A lazy pod mobile phone holder (don't judge). I usually watch movies and videos on my phone. I don't have a smart tv so I mostly watch on my phone while working on my laptop when I'm home as opposed to holding my phone all throughout. For me at least, it's a productivity pod. It also lowers the instances where I sleep on my headphones or charger. Oh and it's also great for looking at recipes while cooking (I have smart scroll on my phone)."
"$50 bluetooth wireless headphones.

It's strange how a fantasy I had when I was a kid is just a short drive to Target. No. More. Wires. I use them every single day."

"A fry / potato cutter. I have a toddler who loves fries so I make a ton of them at home for him. Sweet potato, no oil or salt added. It‚Äôs the same nutrition as eating a baked sweet potato, so I go all out for him because he enjoys it and it‚Äôs healthy.

But I was getting pretty tired of cutting up the fries."
"ha, my mind went to my Swell I use for coffee every work day so I get your love of insulated bottles."
The tool kit from IKEA. We use it all the time and it just slides into a tiny space in the TV cabinet. 
I signed up for that new amc stubs a list it allows me to see 3 movies for free each week. I have seen the avengers three times and ant man and the was twice. It‚Äôs allowed me to get out of the house and see movies I probably wouldn‚Äôt ever go see. 
$2 back scratcher
Zojirushi is BIFL renowned. 
I hired a cleaner for one hour a week. Best thing ever
"Just seconding this; Zojirushi is amazing. Have to be careful with hot liquids in them, though. It will keep your boiling hot water boiling hot all day."
Condoms
A pizza that could feed how many people?
Nice!
"Oh right, Xbox controllers ran on batteries... PlayStation was better in that regard. "
She sounds pretty thoughtful and probably detail oriented. 
"Do you drink different teas for different moods or events? 

A tea in the morning to help you wake up, one to help fall asleep, one if you're stressed, etc."
What do you build? 
Fuck this sounds perfect. I also have tinnitus so complete silence is rare for me.  
What are you eating all the time? I only ever need a toothpick if I ate something meaty. 
"Well that depends on the person, it could feed one of me, anywhere from 2-4 teenagers, or 8 kids, maybe 4-5 adults, or a large number of people who aren't very hungry"
"Yes they were, but I don't regret getting my Xbox."
Oh absolutely. Shes the opposite of a softie but it just makes it that much more flattering when she does things for me :)
"Pretty much just whatever I feel like having, also guess the weather can effect my choices. As iced tea on a hot day is always great if I remember to make any. Along with just ones reserved for more serious drinking and some just more casual.

"
Furniture. 
I could maybe eat a single medium pan pizza from Domino's by myself in one very hungry and empty stomach sitting. 
"I regret my PlayStation, so much time sank :p"
She's a softie on the inside :p
What's the difference between serious and casual tea?
The floor is more than capable. 
I've been able to EST a whole pizza since I was ~12 lol
Wasn't it fun time though?
I think in a perfect world she would be much more giving. Its just sorta hard for a broke teen to make nice gestures I guess. But we do have a friendship I wouldn't trade for anything!
Just sort of more focused brewing and tea drinking compared to casual where I'd be drinking tea and doing something else. I prefer more serious sessions when possible but for sure also just enjoy drinking tea while doing other stuff.
I enjoy building furniture. Puts my mind at ease. It‚Äôs like my form of yoga or meditation lol. 
"Lmao, that can come in handy when there's no enough room in the fridge for left overs. "
Yeah definitely. The majority of my life's laughs are thanks to my PlayStation and online friends. 
I never thought tea could be so intense. 
"I really want to get into woodworking, I guess it's kind of similar? Just don't have the funds or space. It does seem super calm and focused like meditation and you make something out of it. "
So you shouldn't regret it!
Some teas just sort of have subtle flavors which is sort of a waste if its a tea your just casually drinking. So sort of have them reserved for when I feel like really sitting down and having tea. Compared to more everyday sort of teas with good flavors but not as much complexity.
"Yea at the end after packing up all the rubbish, knowing it started as a million parts and now it‚Äôs whole, is rewarding. "
"That's true, but kind of feel disappointed since most other people were out living life and having experiences.  It's like playing sports all the time. It's nice, but too much time and it can be detrimental even though you're having fun. "
So some teas are a waste to drink if you're rushing through it or not savoring each sip. 
"In my opinion, as long as you aren't neglecting the things you have to do, you shouldn't feel guilty."
"Yea for sure, although luckily plenty that are good for downing lol. More expensive teas usually are more complex but mid ranged ones seem great for almost any day. Although I do have a bunch of samples to get through when I feel like really committing to drinking them.

"
"I was escaping a lot :p

I could probably have 4 degrees with the time I put into gaming. "
What's your favorite tea? 
But it's important to have time to do things that you enjoy.
"For sure shou pu'erh been drinking a lot of it lately, have some newer factory stuff for daily drinking along with some more aged ones."
"Yeah, I haven't enjoyed life much in a long time. Thanks for the clarity"
"I'll add it to my list of things to try out. It was pleasant talking to you, I'm gonna try to fall asleep now. "
"Yeah, you've gotta give yourself time to have fun or you won't be very happy."
"I think I have to be in the mood to get a quick fix of happiness from something brief like an inspirational video or article. Every once in a while I like listening to MLK speeches. 

What makes me truly happy (or less bummed out) is when I start tackling the stressors I have in life head on. Or going out to play golf. That's probably what gives me the most satisfaction. 

I also like playing guitar and poetry. Although i haven't done those things enough that I feel good doing them, as I've lost a little bit of skill in the last two years. "
"I over think things and find myself in this situation a lot. I would suggest watching a movie or tv show. If you're trying to avoid feeling sad or down I would go for a comedy, I just watched Mrs. Doubtfire the other day. "
"When I‚Äôm lacking motivation to do something, I always listen to music. Particularly, video game soundtracks get me pumped for dealing with whatever stands in my way.  

If you‚Äôre into that, I can offer some playlists I tune in to just for getting motivated. :)"
"Goals, goals, goals. I‚Äôm not talking bout something huge, just set milestones. If this is what I want then I have to do this, then this, then this. Every time you complete something you‚Äôll keep moving forward. Accomplishing something is a huge mental boost. 

Also watch this for some deep thought on creating your future.

I'm always down and sad during the day. During the day I surf the web to pass the time and not feel very depressed. In the evening I like to go out for a run or a walk. I wait until midnight to feel motivated to work. It always works and until around 3am I'm the most focused and productive person on the planet. Usually I study while listening to some music and get a lot of shit done.
"One of the major stresses I'm dealing with right now is that I'm hardly getting any art/animation done. It's been an entire week and I still haven't finish this one small animation and to be completely honest I absolutely hate how it looks. 

I'm a request artist so whenever it takes me awhile to get work done I feel like I'm a failure and I'm disappointing people. It really, really sucks"
"Aaah Mrs Doubtfire. I absolutely love that movie <3 My only problem is that I struggle to find the motivation to watch anything when I'm like this, though I suppose it's worth a try, thank you!"
"Please do! I've been searching for some good soundtracks to listen to, YouTube recommendations aren't the most reliable source of good motivating music"
"I've actually been thinking about making a dreams/goals list to look at when I need a bit of inspiration. Do you think that'll work? Also thanks for the link, it looks like it'll be an interesting video"
I'll give that a go! The only roadblock for me is that I have to take meds to get me asleep so I'd have to wait until they wear off. The sleeping meds I have put me in a really dark mood so it's really tricky not to sleep. Thanks for sharing (:
"I understand completely. I was a freelance writer for a long time, so not completing a gig sometimes meant I could go hungry for a couple of weeks. They took so damn long to pay even when I DID complete a project on time that the only option was to meet deadlines. I was always a bit behind early on in my career. 

Sometimes being in a creative field means simply sucking it up and getting the job done. There were so many times I hated every sentence I wrote for clients, but they still kept hiring me. It's a serious give and take lifestyle. 

I guess my advice is to work on side projects solely for you. That's why I always tried to keep up on poetry. I need to get back into it again. 

Hope that helps :)"
"Sorry I couldn't help more! The only other things I would recommend would be walking or taking a hot shower. I know thats boring but those usually act as ""restarts"" to the day. But everyone is different when it comes to motivation. "
"Most, if not all, of these soundtracks are from indie games that I don‚Äôt see mentioned enough, if you really like a particular game‚Äôs music in this list, I highly suggest playing it!

First playlist is from a game I got recently called hackmud, an MMO PVP Hacking game. 

https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeivzRdz7xckZnMxVOsE6XfVCR3Cv385C

This set of music plays when you‚Äôre getting into the hacking itself, yet, in my opinion, serves as awesome and intense music for non-hacking tasks. 

This next playlist is from a game called Crypt of the Necrodancer, a roguelike game that relies on the music‚Äôs rhythm for turn-based gameplay.

https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhFC8pd7oZvwJYhjmpZVyaKG7CUNoVvae

This playlist includes all the original songs, composed by Danny Baranowsky as well as remixes from A_Rival, FamilyJules and Jake Kaufman. I like to have this in the background particularly when walking, as I often find myself stepping to its easily understandable beat.

My last suggestion comes from a game called Master Spy, a platformer meant to be hardcore, but the music itself left me motivated to conquer its difficult stages.

https://youtu.be/8unsJEpX1ZE

The Mission themes are my go-to tracks for getting motivated but the others are still nice to listen to.

Sorry for this wall of text, just thought I‚Äôd give my sincere thoughts. Hope you enjoy!"
"I‚Äôm a strong believer in the law of attraction, have you heard of it? So for me I believe that your dream/goals list is a good idea and if you keep focusing on those things by reading them everyday then they will come to you. It won‚Äôt be instant, but you will notice how certain people, opportunities, and events will come your way. When they do just make sure you acknowledge that they came because you desired them or you will lose that flow. 

I myself print pictures of what I want to keep those things in my main focus. So far I can‚Äôt disagree that it works."
"It really does, thank you! There are a lot of ideas I've had brewing in my head lately; perhaps taking a break and doing them and working on something I love would help. I don't rely on doing art requests as a source of income (I actually do them for free) since I'm kinda too young to take up a job and knowing these things about working in the creative field is going to seriously help when I'd old and experienced enough to take it up as a job (or as a side job/hobby) Seriously, thank you so much <3"
"Hey, there's no need to apologize. Most people would probably just skip past this without a second thought, so your advice means a lot. "
"Wow, I've never heard of those games before. I'm a huge fan of indie games and rpg maker games so I'll try and give them a go one day. Thank you!"
"Neat, I'll make that list then. Thanks for your help, I really appreciate it"
"Happy to help friend! If there's one last bit of advice I can give is that you should charge for your work (eventually). I remember one day being fed up with payment in ""exposure"" and ""experience"" that I said no more free work. It was the most liberating thing in the world. It took a long time to get there, college and a few internships, but hot damn it only got better from that point forward.

You do you! Work on those projects! You'll feel better, but I already think you know that ;)"
"Advice taken! Again, thank you so much!"
"This cannot be discounted. I remember when I was preparing for interviews, getting that damn thing tied where it didn't look like crap was quite a chore. So congrats because it is really an art."
The only way I can tie a tie is the four hand knot and it always turns out like shit.
"Thank you! I tried a ton and was ready to give up, but I decided that I wasn't tired enough to sleep and had nothing better to do, so i just kept trying."
"I would probably recommend just trying/practicing in your off time if you are bored and don't have anything better to do. What I did  while doing mine was focusing on doing the individual steps really well and going back if something looked off, until it looks acceptable. Don't give up!"
"It does take practice, and perhaps help from those who are pros. I know I sure needed some lessons!"
That's a good tip actually. It's a shame that I can't fit in my dress shirts anymore. I choose to believe it's because of my massive abs but I think we both know that's not true...
"Having gone through the same thing, I guarantee you that that wasp will be your new roommate for the next two days"
"Pretty nice, got rainmeter going on my laptop and it is really nice with the skins I have loaded"
Well it‚Äôs only 11 here. I‚Äôll send your past self a message to warn you
I killed a big ass one the other day it flew less than a foot from my arm and just sat there until my shoe squished the breath from his lungs because hell naw not today you bastard your not stinging me lol
Nice so far. You should open your window btw.
"Sounds terrible, no wasps in here and I'm just hanging out playing some runescape."
"dude I've had like, this happen too me too and there was only two solutions for it, the one I did and the cool kids way to do it. This is what i did: stay up all night, stay up till morning and then gtfo and deal with that shit later cause you gotta get you some breakfast. This is like the smart way: I'm pretty sure they go to light, so like quickly escape bedroom and turn on hallway light, then just keep leading him till you get to a room with windows and open one of those bois, bam, problem solved. "
I'll get the gas can and lighter.  
"Sounds terrible. Reminds me of when I was home alone with doggo and about a handful of yellow jackets managed to get inside the house. I spent so much time trying to get rid of them (simply taking them outside, but I eventually resorted to grabbing a broom and trying to swat them away.) "
Time to burn down the house and move to another country! 
What skins are you running?
The problem there is that it's guarding the window. I'll just wait for it to fly out into the hallway where it becomes everyone else's problem 
That kills the house
"I‚Äôll have to check, but i‚Äôll tell ya when I find out for sure"
"The skins I have are Cleartext, Frost, Honeycomb, Raw Time, and Translucent Taskbar"
Some of the best friends I have I've met online and maintained those friendships over long periods of time. I've met some but it didn't even strengthen those friendships. That was all established online. 
What is your therapist‚Äôs reasoning for this? It just sounds like his/her opinion.  People were penpals for years before the internet...  a connection doesnt always have to be physical!
"I definitely think online friends/relationships have the same value as 'real life' friends/relationships. I have a few friends on PSN who I talk to weekly, if not daily, and we've become very close friends and have stayed friends for a couple of years. I've shared my journey through pregnancy with them and they've shares their lives with me. We get excited for one another when good things happen, and sad when bad things happen. We're Facebook friends as well, so we're always sharing photos, links, etc. I don't typically see my 'real life' friends often either, so it's basically the same thing in my opinion. What matters is the connection you make with someone, whether they're 5 miles or 5,000 miles away. I don't think a friendship or relationship being based online changes that. If it's a good friendship/relationship, it's valid. üíú"
"One of my dearest, best friends and biggest supports in my life is an online friend I met 10 years ago. Until a few months ago where we played an online game together for the first time (and voice chatted) our friendship was purely over text. 

I 100% see her as just as important as any friend I've met. We've been there for each other through so much. "
"They don't have the *same* connection, and it is true that real-life relationships, assuming all orher factors being equal, *are* better...

But that isn't to say online relationships are worthless or not meaningful."
"Your therapist is right. You forget that all these people are in the same boat you are. They rely on the internet for socialization. 

I know I'm going to be downvoted, but I know this is true because I have gone through this, and so have my friends. 

There's nothing wrong with making friends online, and having them be close to you. The problem comes when you rely on these online relationships as your sole source of intimacy. It may not seem this way, but you are actually creating a wall to keep yourself from being intimate with others.

Again, I like to emphasize that I also am working on this issue, and I have friends who go through the same thing (albeit, unknowingly)."
"I think they don't have the same connection as physical relationships, your therapist may have a point however i fully believe that online friends are true friends or at least can be. I am in a facebook group with guys and we drop messages, have arguments, joke about things every single day. Those conversations mattered to me. Sure they may all be about the one subject but they are a sharing of ideas and beliefs. Their opinions matter to me more than mere strangers. Surely that is the very basis of a friendship."
I don't think they do. Could give a fuck about anyone I talk to on here. I'm all about real people and real relationships. This is just text on a screen.
"Online relationships are definitely valuable, but I prefer physical relationships because there are many things you can do together away from the computer, such as playing sports, grabbing food, and just generally hanging out. The intimacy of talking face to face can't be matched online, imo. "
"No they don‚Äôt. They can‚Äôt give you a lift to their airport or visit you st the hospital or help you in rehab. They‚Äôre not there in the happy moments or the sad. They are great for conversation and confiding in - but it‚Äôs not the same at all. You don‚Äôt feel like doing something, don‚Äôt log on. It‚Äôs conditional and all on our own terms. 

IRL if you have to drag your butt out, make an effort, muster up energy. Look someone in the eye and have a hard conversation. Be awkward when you can‚Äôt think of anything to say. 

The dynamics are completely different and so are the expectations ."
"Of course they have value and by your description the therapist did not say they were worthless. 

It is difficult to have an online relationship that is as connected as one where you spend time in person with someone. 

They can happen and maybe yours are. 

Try to consider what the the therapist was trying to do when they told you this. They weren't trying to tell you your online friendships had no value. (or maybe, they were and are terrible therapists.)

They were probably trying to get you to consider in person friendships for some reason. 

"
"I ended up going to a different high school than all of my friends, but we stayed in touch over skype and the like. I only ever got to see them during video calls for 6+ years and I‚Äôm still very close with these people. I‚Äôd say yes they have as much value as you want to put into them"
"I've met some wonderful people on here. I'm quite close with someone I met on this very platform, she's a very very long long way away so I doubt physical meeting'll ever happen.

But she's as good a friend and as valued as any of my physical friends."
"I play a lot of online games and i have connected with a lot of different people trough the years, one day 2 years ago, i was playing R6 with this guy, and i dont remember how the conversation went but he told me that ""we wont be friends in the future because online friendships dont last"". And for me its true, i never connected with anyone for more than a year, they usually last a couple of months for me, then i start to get interested in different stuff and i meet new people and i leave the old ones behind, and they do the same."
"I have a solid group of ppl online I consider friends. I've only met one of them in real life. We all fell apart for a few years but recently reunited and I feel it was for the better. They let me vent and expose me to new ideas just like I feel irl friends do.   

That said, I don't feel like romantic relationships are necessarily the same online. You deserve in real life people when dedicating yourself to someone. 

 In real life, context can also be assured, and you're physical level of attraction is part of the whole deal. The whole package has to be there.

 Online romantic relationships only serve part of the package, and although they may help you develop and grow, I feel they'd always lack something important. "
I know a lot of people who have met online and become awesome friends and met each other in real life too. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs possible to have a great connection. I‚Äôve had it too with a couple of people. Never met them in real life but I definitely have a strong connection with them. I played a lot of games with them and chatted for hours everyday (Yh I sorta have no life lol). Also I read in another comment of yours here that your friendship with this Macedonian person is toxic. I feel like if you can recognise that yourself you should leave that friendship. Happened to me once and I left that relationship too late. There are plenty of people online or in real life that you could meet! 
depends i have some awesome online friends and awesome real life friends i think it can work especially in a busy world we live in
"well, how would you feel if you meet in person your online friends? I agree with her, it¬¥s not te same, but i love my online friend and i look foward to meet them later!"
"I've made a few good online friends. One of them I've known for 11 years and still talk to every now and then. Friends you can go out with and such is definitely a preferred thing, but online friends can be just as fun.


"
"Yes, they can.  I was forced to give up a presence on Facebook due to some personal issues and in doing so I lost contact with people I came to truly came to care about.  Granted, I had never met most of these people, but even now I think about them often and I wonder how they are doing. "
Your therapist is a dipshit.
"I had a few online relationships and many in person ones. They can seem fun at first because simply talking to them and getting a picture of them makes your whole world light up (I was very young when this happened, as most people are in online relationships). That's just the problem. Good relationships don't have you drooling over the person. Good relationships have you being comfortable with that person. That means being in person, doing things together, being intimate (if you're old enough), and not spending 5 hours a day on the phone. Relationships should enhance your life, not hamper it. It's kind of like doing heroin. Yeah, it felt good, but you shutting yourself out to the world for so long everyday isn't good. I know many people want to say they made it work, but some people also won the lottery. Doesn't mean you should buy a ticket and blow off a job interview. For those that made it work, good for you. For others, I really wouldn't recommend it"
"I think it's possible that you're misinterpreting them. Online relationships can still provide great emotional support, but physical aspects of a relationship are important, too. A personal example is that my girlfriend and I are very long distance. Online we can interact emotionally, talk and share experiences by watching movies or playing games together. When we can visit, we can share physical things, like holding hands, sharing a meal, or even just sitting together in the same room when we're too tired to have an intelligent conversation. Both aspects are good and meaningful, but humans are social animals that need a mix of both to be at their best."
"Isn't online technically ""real"" you're just communicating through electronic messaging services meaning you are capable of maintaining good relations regardless of distance. Of course you'd get to know them more if they lived closer but if you are honest and open to each other what's the big deal?   "
"Well she said that you can't really do much with the person, since it's an online relationship. You can't go to the movies, drink beer at home, play video games, etc. You're just unable to have a physical connection with the person."
"Assuming all other factors being equal, an in-person relationship will most often win out."
This is exactly what I wanted to respond with.  Some of the most genuine friendships I've had in my life have been with friends met online.  
Whose to say that they can‚Äôt be real-life relationships?
"Do people have to physically be there to do things for you to be considered a meaningful relationship? I have great friends online and in person, neither of which I request things to be done for me. Very rare that I ask anything of anybody. No doubt, those who can be there to help me in need are great people, but that doesn't negate from a relationship made online. They might be two separate things with different dynamics, but both do have value.  

As well, it comes down to how open a person is to the idea. It's okay if it's not for you, but it can be for someone else. "
I like your username. :)
"I've been friends with my friend from Macedonia for three years now. I actually considered ending our friendship a few months ago, because I felt that she was toxic to me. We still talk often, though. "
"Well she's wrong about the video game part; you can definitely do that online.  And you can both watch the same movie on Netflix or something ""together"".  I've done both.  No, it's not exactly the same, but it counts for a lot."
"She said you can‚Äôt play video games with an online friend? 

Uhm... get a new therapist "
What?
"I think they can be meaningful but I also don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre in the same ballpark. And of course they have value and fulfil different needs. I‚Äôm probably more honest with online friends but that‚Äôs because I don‚Äôt have to look them in the eye when I‚Äôm making a bad decision lol. But they‚Äôre not showing up to my dads funeral with me, and I‚Äôm not bringing them food when they‚Äôre sick etc. 

It‚Äôs different, and if a therapist is recommending more time developing physical relationships it‚Äôs probably because they can see the online aren‚Äôt giving her everything they‚Äôre needing at this point in their life. "
"Don't dead: open inside.

wait...."
"No, I just thought of that"

"When I worked in an elementary school, one day a pupil told me that Im the only adult in the school that actually listens when children speak to them."
A model told me I was a beautiful man. 
"""you're a pretty level headed guy""  A recently made friend said this after a night out.

I strive to be always sensible and clear headed in bad situations because i think it helps as you aren't going to make a rash decision. I really don't understand people that start shouting or become irrational when stuff like this happens, what's the point? You aren't making the situation any better. Doing it calmly and planning out what do to is always my method of solving problems. 

It meant a lot because i had just met this person and we didn't know each other that well so for him to say that, i like to think it was a big part of my character. "
"A girl called me handsome and I could tell she meant it. That was a few years ago, haven‚Äôt had anything come close to that since"
‚ÄûYour voice is so deep and sexy.‚Äú I was 11.

"Probably not exactly what you are looking for, but as the state director of my company was saying goodbye to me at his farewell party, he told me, ""YOu were always nice to deal with. Even when I knew you were upset about something, it always sounded like you were smiling."" Most of the conversations took place over conference call, and yes, others on teh conversation were not as tactful or measured as I was. 

About 3 months later, he recommended me for the director position to a friend of his at another company. So maybe not the nicest compliment one could get, but I really took it to heart and try to continue in its spirit. "
"A co-worker once told me ""Kharn0, you're a genuine guy"" and I realized that it was true, though no one had ever said it to me before, not even gfs.

"Someone called me a ""Filthy Commie"" when I said that we're doing things wrong when 80% of the wealth is owned by around 500 people and almost everyone else is struggling to get by, constantly broke, struggling to pay bills. I took that as a great compliment."
A year or so ago I liked to keep my hair buzzed. One time I forgot to cut my hair and let it grow for a bit when someone told me I had nice hair. I haven't cut it since.
I work at a starbucks and I had someone tell me my voice was very nice and that I should do radio/podcasting. Something small but it really brightened my day :)

"As a part-time job, I help qualified coaches teach kids (usually elementary age) to skate. One day when I was on the ice, a coach was slowly skating with a little boy around the edge of the rink. The coach called me over and asked me a few questions (although I forget exactly what). Then, this little kid piped up, saying, ‚ÄúIn 40 or 50 years, I wanna be just like you!‚Äù For reference, I‚Äôm a guy in my late teens. Still, the innocence, sincerity, and the intent behind his comment left me smiling for the rest of my shift."
"A few years ago I had volunteer ed to go with my son‚Äôs middle school class on a field trip, my other son said something like ‚Äúyou‚Äôre having mom go on your field trip?‚Äù and the first son replied ‚Äúyeah, I want everyone to see what an awesome mom I have.‚Äù He was serious. This is a boy who every night I would say ‚Äúgood night, I love you.‚Äù and his response was ‚ÄúOkay.‚Äù :) 

Today though he is mad at me :) and spending too much time in front of his computer, but I‚Äôll hang on to that middle school comment:)"

"I was told by a close friend that I am a hardworking, successful person. Never felt that way about myself, I didnt think anyone else felt that way about me."
"""You're cute. In your own way."""
"The best one I got recently was from my friend's mom. My friend recently went out to walk her dog, and when that happened, her mom called. Her mom had been really worried about her lately, so to not make her mom worry (since my friend lives in a different city) I answered and told her the she would be back soon.
Turns out her mom really loved my voice and found it very reassuring and charming. I've never heard that before."
You are such an amazing guy how was i so lucky to end up with you.
"I hate to pick one because I don't want to undervalue all the other wonderful compliments I've received, but the one that stands out to me right now is when my high school art teacher called me a ""formidable mind."" She was quite the mind herself, so it really stuck with me."
My friends were talking alignments and they labeled me as a hard chaotic good. It makes me feel like I‚Äôm really becoming a good person knowing that others see me try
"We need more open minded non judgemental people like you :) . I'm sure your co-worker's compliment is true.

"My uncle and I don't always get along, but he's told me a few times that my writing is genuinely good and gave me constructive criticism without taking away from the fact that he thought highly of it. Something I do being thought highly of by him of all people made me happy."
"As someone who's a bit narcissistic despite the extreme lack of any sort of accomplishment in my life, my first ever in person audition for an acting role went extremely well. They were really amazing people and for the past 3 weeks I've been anticipating their decision, as I really really wanted to work with them. I felt that it would have been a special experience, and as a lonely person the script had a lot of love in it that I could relish in for the first time in my life. To have genuine connection. 

I just got an email from them telling me how talented I was, and how they enjoyed my audition and, ""...honestly just you as a person."" This was the best thing I've ever been told. Nothing else tops it. Albeit...that person wasn't the real me during the audition, it was an autistic character that I took a couple weeks to create within me. I wasn't me at all during the course of the audition. Hell, I didn't even make eye contact. As well, that email they sent me was them letting me know that they're going with someone else. 

In the next couple days I'm about to go to Tennessee because I got chosen, with what was only my second audition, for the role of an emotionless killer in an episode of a tv show. In the audition, I only had a few hours to just memorize lines, no less create someone else within me. So I was basically just me. 

Like shit, what does that say? It's actually so poetic, it feels like it came out of one of my depressing script ideas. Hell, I guess I'll use it in a script, it's too good to leave unused. 

At least I can take solace in the possibility I'm genuinely talented (and not completely delusional, like I've been told), even though acting isn't my ambition. Getting chosen, or at least heavily considered, for lead roles (albeit in indie stuff) despite never have being on a film set yet. But damn. I just wanna be happy. The thing is, though, pain creates character. Happy films have never been interesting films for a reason, I guess. The saddest ones are always the best. So I really can't be all that mad at being unhappy. Being the best is all i care about, because being the best nets me better chances at being happy. "
My sister in law cried and said how wonderful I am and how happy she is that I‚Äôm in the family.

"I think its a waste of time. Clothes cost a lot, and you're generally going to wear them infrequently compared to clothes that are inexpensive. It gives a good impression to others at first, but its a shallow impression that's superseded by how you behave. 

But, I mean, dressing up feels really good and when you go in and you look absolutely perfect (based on social standards), then you feel kind of confident about yourself. 

I live in a former British colony and school uniforms are the worst. I could go without it. "
Presenting myself respectably is important. 
">Not to mention the British and their god-awful school uniforms 

As a British person, I agree, the uniforms are god-awful. I hate formality and properness and that stuff. If an event requires me to wear overly fancy getup I just don't go, I don't care how fun or worthwhile the event is, if I have to wear a suit or something, it gets a hard pass from me."
"I'm the first to admit that I like dressing up, but if I ever get married, I think I'll say that people can wear whatever they want to my wedding (barring local decency laws, of course)."
"> It gives a good impression to others at first, but its a shallow impression that's superseded by how you behave.

Bingo!"
It's more how the expectations of how you look and behave move depending on the event. 
"When I first saw the Harry Potter movies, I was very confused. And well, I still am. There are no Ties mentioned anywhere in the books"
"Watch, someone's going to show up in a Potato-sack dress now"
"Well, now I know you're biased :P

We're all human though. As much as society tells me that a well fitting suit looks good on a person and that its attractive, its hard for me not to look past it. That's kind of my gripe with professional jobs anyway. You're forced to wear something that looks 'professional' because it gives others a good impression. "
Yes it is. 
"Ties are an extremely common part of British school uniforms, especially in ""classier"" schools, since Hogwarts is somewhat ""classy"" it'd be almost weird, to Brits at least, for them not to be wearing ties."
"Well, if that's what they're most comfortable in, then so be it, ha ha."
"Ahh, society. Telling us what to think and how to feel for the last 12,000 years or so. No way a decision made by a group could ever be wrong.


And at work, they recently got rid of the dress code, but I still haven't gone full T-Shirts yet. But this winter, there will be 100% hoodies"
"Just, the general idea of school uniforms isn't really shown/mentioned in the books. And let's be honest, taking some rotten apples (Slytherin) and putting them in shirt and tie dosen't suddently make them good"
"Hoodies are a godsend. They're like a blanket that you can just take everywhere with you. If you're not client-facing, why do you even NEED a dress code? No one cares anyway. "
"Oh I know, kids are little shits no matter how they're dressed, they'll find something to bully each other over, or maybe they'll just bully each other for no reason at all."
"If you're meeting a customer/client for the first time, then you should be above a basic standard. But after that, who really cares. Your actions speak louder than how you dress.

"My father has his own, sometimes reckless, way of doing things. So you have one overly worried newbie and one sometime reckless experienced driver who never taught someone else to drive AFAIK.

"Yeah that's why I prefer learning from strangers. With a minimum of preconceptions about me, they're more likely to pay attention to how I'm actually acting, be that confident or uncertain. "
I am going to try this.  Thanks for sharing.
I like to read books. I can get completely into the stories of fantasy worlds if it's a good book and block out everything around me. I'll also binge watch Netflix series when I don't feel like reading and take some melatonin about an hour before bed. The melatonin helps me sleep and wake up fully refreshed and able to focus. 
"then tomorrow you look at everything you just said right now and go 'what a load of spiel, i don't even care that much'. i think that questioning every choice, thought, and opinion you have is very important but it is also very easy to get stuck in a thinking loop and devolve into complicated, self-absorbed chaos. Much like everything you've posted right now. 

I think realising the idea that the next day, everything you said previously, everything you poured all your thinking power into to produce a paragraph of introspective knowledge is well... Useless. You've just said what you needed to hear, but in reality the next day you won't care because, man, you're more worried about breakfast or something. I don't think the anxious mind can escape its paranoia by rationalising it in extreme detail, because in a sense it is that extreme detail which creates your anxiety in the first place.

I'm a really anxious and paranoid person too who dreads everything in life. I need to find a healthy way to become more confident but I know from experience trying to silence my inescapable thought machine with more and more theories and ideas as to how my inner problems work doesn't help at all. this was a good post thank you"
"Quit thinking. Quit being so emotional. 

I go through the same thing, and tell myself what I posted above. Can be hard, but that's literally all you have do. All we're doing is stressing ourselves for no reason. So dumb."

Overthinking is mostly caused by emotional ties to hopeful ideal.
"I kinda like telling my personal stuff to people online, they comfort me."
"I have the same problem üò•üò•üò•
I think of over thinking as a gift and a curse at the same time. If you're the one who's controlling your mind, then it's a gift, but if your mind is in control, then it's your worst nightmare. I honestly don't have a way to counter that. I kinda want to discover a way to turn off my mind to put my self at ease, but in the same time I'm afraid that I'll lose that gift. What I'm hopefully trying to do is to stop over thinking and start doing instead. Instead of living in the dream, try to use that time and effort to do something in real life, but still I have a long path to go. "
"I don‚Äôt really think I have this problem, even though I do think about possibilities and outcomes of events very often. I‚Äôm glad you found a helpful way to control it! It‚Äôs so cheesy but in moments like that, things like the ‚Äúdeep breaths, count to 10‚Äù and other related tactics help me a lot personally to clear my mind. :)"
No problem :) 
"Reading helps me, too. But the same compulsion that causes me to over-think sometimes leads to me reading compulsively in order to keep my brain busy. "
"Yes! I marathon Lord of the Rings or That 70's Show whenever I'm stressing out. I can just take a break from my own brain and be a part of another world. This doesn't work if I'm super anxious/depressed, though, because I won't be able to fully immerse myself if there's still a dumb part of my brain that won't shut up about something."
"I hear you, but I think we're opposites here! Rationalising my paranoia is really the only way to get myself to calm down. I find confronting my ""inescapable thought machine"" (I love this phrase, btw) the easiest way to get me stuck in my head wondering why I'm so paranoid about every aspect of life when, as you mentioned, it probably doesn't even matter. I find my method doesn't really silence my thought machine, it just allows me to slow it down by assuring myself with rational thoughts. Typically, I would rely on my SO or my mom for assurance, but it feels good learning how to do it myself. :)

I hope you're making leaps and bounds on your journey to a life less riddled with anxiety and paranoia! I'm here to talk if you want."
"It really is dumb. But idk, I feel that forcing myself to just stop thinking makes it worse. I prefer to tell myself ""ok, that's an interesting thought, but we're done with it now"" and then move on. "
I'm getting there. How else have you overcome overthinking? Seeing as to how you wrote in past-tense leads me to believe you've gotten over your problem?
100&#37; correct. I should probably start working on letting go of a hopeful ideal to deal with the root of my problem.
"Yeah, if I have a real dilemma, the internet is the first place I go. "
It really is a nightmare when your mind takes over. The worst is when it's not even about anything you have control over.
"I do read compulsively, I'll admit. Drives my wife crazy sometimes."
"I'm not sure if it was clearly overthinking, but listening to music helped me a lot. Not just a few songs from time to time, but I'm basically always listening to something that I love now, and I stopped caring about other people's judgement. If I want to listent to hard rock or death metal, so I do. If I want to listen to video game's music, same thing. It's simplified a lot but I can explain you in PM if you want."
"Dressed like a cow to get free chick fil a.That was pretty awkward, but free so I‚Äôm not complaining."
Thankfully few if any. I try to run the opposite direction of them.
"I saw a classmate at a college tour in a different state. We've interacted with each other enough to be familiar with one another, but not enough to talk to each other unprompted. We've also known each other for 4 years and have separate friend groups that combine in a sort of middle, venn-diagram area.


Yeah so we keep taking peeks at each other and looking away when we thought we were spotted. Okay..."
"Haha that‚Äôs something I could see myself doing. I always ask for everything on my burger though, all toppings are the best topping.

I went to Rite Aid a few days ago to pick up an oral syringe. So I go to the pharmacist and ask for an oral syringe, and she looks at me with the strangest look and asks ‚Äúwith a needle??‚Äù She thought I was looking to go shoot heroin or something haha... I‚Äôm like no, an *oral syringe*"
"Some friends and I went hiking, and she has a terribly tiny car and I‚Äôm not a terribly tiny man. After the hour car ride along with hearing her and her friend sing Disney songs remade by famous peeps, I tried prodding her out of the car by poking her rib. I missed and poked her titty and she wasn‚Äôt mad or even irritated, but I felt so uncomfortable. 
(The moment I got out however was relief, as I reached for the sky my entire body became a bag of popcorn in the microwave.) "
"i sat down next to a guy on the bus and he said ""wow, your eyes are really big."" 

i thought it was a bad thing and i didnt really know how to respond so i stuttered a bunch and said ""um...sorry...""

he was really confused about what i was apologizing for and he told me it was a compliment, then we had to just sit there in silence for like 30 minutes "
"Absolutely! That same friend and I went hiking again recently where we climbed up a waterfall, it was gorgeous. The clean, brisk air with the greenery encapsulating all sight. Get some hiking in! 

She‚Äôs pretty chill in general, plus I was vocal about wanting out of the car while she intentionally wouldn‚Äôt move, kept to her phone and told me, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to take my time just because you want out.‚Äù 

Do you have a lot of hiking spots around ya?

(Whoops. Wrong kind of response.) "
I walked in on my boyfriend's brother mid pee today! I felt so bad. I was a little drunk and kinda started at him for a couple seconds too long before realizing it wasn't my boyfriend!!
"Not really an awkward encounter but I just remembered, yesterday, of all the cringey things I‚Äôve done/said to this girl I‚Äôve had a crush on. I was kicking myself about it lmao. But, I‚Äôm trying to work on myself so hopefully next time I see her I can make the best of the situation. "
"I was at the store buying dog food. The cashier was a ridiculously pretty, tall blonde girl. She says ""do you have a big dog or a small one?"" I reply ""I've got two big ones."" Then I chuckled for some reason, which made her instantly know that I just thought of my testicles. Both of our faces got red and we smiled and she said ""two big dogs, got it."" I just replied ""yup!"", grabbed my bag and took off. I can never go back."
Went to get my car worked on told the lady I‚Äôd wait on it she ends up calling me while I‚Äôm in the lobby. 
"Falling asleep in pre-employment. Bumping the wall with my chair every once in a while, first impression on a guy with a really dope fucking beard was me nearly falling over as I stood up."
Hey free food is free food! Was there a special event going on or was this a dare? 
Yep the situation where you see someone you know and you don‚Äôt know if you should say hi or wave to acknowledge their existence. It seems like the both of you were probably wondering the same thing haha 
"Which is why I think my little blunder paid off because I‚Äôm not picky with my toppings and it was pretty good :) 

Oh man, your pharmacist must‚Äôve been confused and worried about you for a second there "
"Hiking is a healthy thing to do in the summer, I should go sometime. Good thing she was chill about it, especially because it was purely accidental. I‚Äôm a girl and there are moments when I unknowingly elbow my female friends in the boobs. I always apologize and they just laugh it off. It happens more than I‚Äôd like to admit. "
"Aww your first reaction was to apologize. Don‚Äôt worry, what he said was a pretty weird conversation starter. I know some people mean well but sometimes it‚Äôs difficult to know what to say. 

I‚Äôm Asian and there was this one guy on the subway who came up to me and said, ‚Äúmy uncle works with silk‚Äù and I didn‚Äôt know what to say so I just said, ‚Äúgood for him!‚Äù 

He then kept going on and on about his uncle, silk, and China. "
"This might just be the inspiration I needed to get my friends together and go for a long hike! 

Your friend loves messing with you it seems haha 

I‚Äôm sure there are some hiking spots near where I live but I‚Äôve never really sought them out y‚Äôknow? "
It was cow appreciation day so chick fil a was giving away a free entree to anyone dressed up like a cow.
"When you walk down a hallway and see an aquaintence, make eye contact, but don't know whether to say hi.


When you walk down a hallway, you and a friend see each other from a distance (or you see them), and you don't know when the appropriate distance is to say hi.


When you see a past teacher in the hallway, make eye contact, but don't know if you had a good enough relationship with them to say hi.


Oof my anxiety."
"I‚Äôve had moments when I would wave at someone and they turn away just in time to miss it.

In high school I had a teacher first semester who I was friendly with. As second semester rolled around, our greetings would get more and more awkward. It then turned into ignoring each other completely as we pass by each other in the halls, although with a glance here and there. "
"I vote for Ms. Trunchbull in Matilda, but I hate kids, lol"
Hell yeah. All the time. Tired of the vanilla cookie-cutter ending.
"You're not alone in this as I do the same thing the majority of the time because ""heroes"" have become so criminally underwritten and underdeveloped in movies and certain TV shows. It's the anti-heroes that are taking things over and have become the obsession of nearly everyone (Tony Soprano, Walter White, Don Draper, etc.). Typically, the villains/anti-heroes have far better lines of dialogue than the heroes, have more interesting story lines/arcs than the heroes, and are more nuanced and duplicitous than their heroic counterparts. "
Villains are always the most interesting characters in TV/Movies. It's hard not to root for them. 
"I hope this doesn‚Äôt sound too snooty mcsnoots, but I often find myself rooting for more interesting characters in general. Even ones like Thanos and Kylo Ben Swolo, while showing some differentiation, their backstories and personalities have the potential to really wring out some gorgeous nuances. But maybe I am just being a snot. "
"Well, there's a fine difference between ""anti-hero"" and ""villain"", as u/coolHandLeek9 mentioned. but if you're talking strictly villains, one I really rooted for was Hugh Laurie in Tomorrowland. 

Long story short, the main characters go on this mad heist to find this secret World's Fair-esque society of innovators, and the villain basically rags on the protagonists for wanting to fix the hidden society when there's so much terrible stuff happening in the real world and whatnot. I was pleasantly surprised by that kind of depth in a Disney movie, of all things. Unfortunately, the movie's not very good save for Laurie's performance. Brad Bird has better movies."
"Villains almost always make you question your morals, which to me makes a character more interesting if they're able to do that. Billy from Scream was my favorite growing up. Thinking about this question you posed, Moriarty from BBC's Sherlock is the one that is really sticking out for me right now. I loved watching him. "
"Did you know that in an episode of Tom and Jerry, Tom got FUCKING BEHEADED?


Tom was guarding his king so he could sleep and Jerry and his nephew tried to steal food and cause a ruckus. Trying to quiet them and guard food, Tom was unsuccessful, and you can see the rats look at the guillotine drop down from a distance. Then the nephew says, in French, ""poor, poor pussycat. That is war,"" and continues marching happily and triumphantly.


Honestly I'm rooting for Tom most of the episodes."
"A decent amount, at least. Most of the time try to figure out the motivations of characters - don't really like characters where they're ""just evil"" or ""they're simply just good"". ""Evil"" characters I get the impression often have interesting backstories.

In addition to that more general thought, villains tend to do horrible things. But why? I find stories about people doing bad things with a goal of greater good in mind fascinating, not least because it raises philosophical questions.

Also I think the ""bad guys"" generally look cooler. As in, they are visually more interestingly designed - cool spikes, a dope suit, a cape of pure darkness...

These points are a bit all over, but yeah definitely find myself from time to time thinking that the villains should win."
"I rooted for Thanos mainly because I somewhat agreed with his solution. I don't know why but I just did. Also, the whole scene with (SPOILERS AHEAD) 

Gamora dying 


just made me appreciate him more. 

Also, How reddit format. Send help "
Mainly when its Tom and Jerry.
"This is why I love movies with no real hero and no real villain, only protagonist and antagonist. I love Lestat in Interview with a Vampire, but he becomes the protagonist in the following books, and I still root for him because I love my brat prince <3"
"That might be why I do it, at least partially. Happy endings are so overdone and boring. I want something interesting, and the villain winning is interesting."
"I appreciate this fact though, because random, boring villains really drag a movie, TV show, or whatever down. I feel like good villains significantly improve the quality of their media."
"That's what I think too. Interesting villains are really memorable to me, far more memorable than interesting heroes most of the time."
"Unrelated, but I love your username."
"Oh no, you're not being a snot at all. In fact, I'm a huge fan of both Thanos and Kylo because of how interesting they are."
"That's interesting. My favorite kind of villains are those that are doing a very evil thing for a noble reason. But really, I like most villains."
"I know, Thanos from Avengers Infinity War actually made me think quite a bit. He was a villain with an evil goal but for noble reasons."
"Poor Tom, he was such a good cat."
"When I play GTA I always gotta do bad shit because most movies and media don't ever allow the bad guy to get away with stuff, mostly."
"I like to think its partly due to a natural curiosity of a villains mind set and motives. seeing captain America whoop ass is fun. but there's not a lot of layers to him. the true joy I get from a film or show is when i realise that I'm suddenly sympathizing with a character that has killed people. not because I condone what he did. but because film give us a chance to explore the mind of someone so polar opposite to the idea of a hero. captain Americas motives are obvious. the cool thing about Thanos is that while he is a murderous figure. he still offers justification that you cant deny hold reason. ever watch nbc's Hannibal? this guy not only kills people. but he makes sure the last moments of his victim's are undignified and a insulting and humbling experience. he destroys minds. but you cant help but like him because of his intelligence. elligance. larger than life picture. if anything. he's so impressive at what he does, even if that means killing. that one cant help but appreciate the intelligence and deep planning and understanding how minds operate. it's easy to root for the hero. but to root for a villian introduces complex psychological questions. and isn't that why we watch movies? to enter a world or the mind  of someone that couldn't be more different to us, but still it gets your mind thinking. and helps you appreciate perspective and just how they justify what they do"
"They genuinely do in my opinion also! No one wants a one-dimensional villain that's going to monologue, have one, static and un-interesting goal in the grand scheme of things, and just be there as nothing more than a gloried plot point for the protagonist to overcome in the third act climax. It's insulting to the viewers and severely cripples the story as well as its re-viewability. "
I‚Äôm optimistic that Pt. 2 will further Thanos and his character development to gives us a magnificent and memorable ending. :)
"Can't blame you, they have the most fun."
"Oh absolutely. I was watching that and thinking, ""But is he wrong though....?"" I mean how many times have you been asked, ""Would you sacrifice the lives of a few if it meant savings hundreds or thousands?"" And sure....his number was bigger than a few...but you know what I mean lol. And honestly, with all of those damn super hero fights, how many innocent bystanders have been injured because they happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. But it's okay because it was for justice, right??? üòí"
"Oh yeah, in GTA 5, I don't even do the missions that make you money very much. I just go around killing people in various ways. It's fun."
"I've never seen Hannibal, but your description of the villain kind of reminds me of Thrawn, and he's my favorite character in all of fiction."
Exactly my thoughts.
"It better. If part 2 is bad, I will be very very very disappointed with Marvel. But I trust the Russo brothers. I've loved every Marvel movie they've put out."
"Lol, that's true."
The age of heroes has come and gone. It's time for balance.

"They do know how to make a damn good movie, but my gripe is inherent with having such a huge cast. Although I could still be salty that Steve Rogers was given maybe two and a half milliseconds of screen time. -__-‚Äò "
"Perhaps I will. It's unlikely because I spend most of my time with TV watching Star Wars or Marvel shows, but maybe I will."
"I do really hope they do something with him in part 2, he needs some character time."
"This. Life is so much negatives but you just have to patient for the little positives to show. There's lots of big bad things but if you waste your time waiting for the big positive things, well you're probably only going to be even more let down. Life's all about the little things. ~ just a little piece of my mind. Hope you have a great week man. "
"It always feels good to be truly appreciated, especially after being treated like crap all day. "
"I'm sorry to hear about your shit day but I'm glad it got better in the end! My day is alright, not doing much."
Thanks. Just had another dumpster dive incident rn lol. It‚Äôs a pretty good feeling putting smiles on the face of people after dealing with shit.
I agree. Normally this place is really chill and this past week it‚Äôs just been terrible. Hopefully it gets better.
"Nice, that‚Äôs what‚Äôs summers about lol"
"Yea don't pay no mind to all the others, pity em if anything cause obviously they're not enjoying life. Not much is worth getting upset over. Be chill lol"
I‚Äôm just a bit frustrated about it all and trying to channel it into a conversation on here lol. I‚Äôm sorry if it sounded like a rant.

"I'm all kinds of geek.  Let's see...

- Literature, especially modernist fiction.  Besides reading and studying them, I also like having some first and other special editions.  
- Music, especially jazz.  I also like classical, blues, soul, funk, some rock, and a bunch of other stuff.  
- Musical instruments, especially pianos, saxophones, and guitars.  
- Audio gear.  I hesitate to use ""audiophile,"" as I haven't spent *that* much, but I like having a totally groovetastic system.  
- Related to audio gear, vinyl LPs.  I usually stick to the old ones, though.
- Driving and cars.  I love taking a fun, nimble car with a manual transmission for a drive.  I wish I could spend more time with track days and the like, but sadly not thus far.  I don't really care for stratospherically expensive supercars, though, maybe because I've met too many insufferable people who owned them.  
- Learning stuff.  Pretty much anything.  Even when shopping for a gift I'll spend an inordinate amount of time researching and learning about them.  Or simply decide to read a subject that's sparked my interest.  


I'll stop, this has probably already gotten obnoxious.  So, yeah, I'm a total nerd."

5. Any academic subject besides world history and English, so literally any STEM, US history, ancient history, geography, and arts."
"Oh yeah bro sorry for not being specific. Picard is so thoughtful and diplomatic but will still tackle a dude if necessary, what a man. Love you btw."
I could geek talk about sports and games in general for hours.
"Star Wars, Marvel and DC comics and movies, Lord of the Rings, Fallout and Resident Evil lore, Pokemon and especially The Office!"
"Grey's Anatomy, for sure!"
"For sure tea and stuff related to it, kinda just know a bunch of random stuff along with hands on experience for brewing and a scale to weigh my leaves."
"Oooh all i would say is at least give Next Gen a go, the first two seasons are not the best but if you can relate and stick to those characters long term you will go on an introspective psychological journey.

DC Comics particularly classic Batman stories 
"Anything I get really obsessed with..

Currently, it's The Good Place. I swear, I can watch each episode multiple times without getting tired of it. It's gotten to the point where I try to find interviews and podcasts of the producers, directors, and actors/actresses talking about the concept of the show or anything relating to it! I recommended that show to everyone I know üòÇ"
"Romanticism. I feel like it's really niche, but I am just in love with art and literature from the Romantic era. I love the emphasis on nature. Whenever I read poems or essays or whatever from that period, I feel like I really get it, or it gets me. I'm kind of a shut-in, so the school of thought that nature and individuality lend value and meaning to existence makes me feel good about life. And art from that period is so beautiful. Specifically the Hudson River School. The light and scope of the landscapes really captures the wonder of nature and existence. 

In short, works from that time period make me appreciate life's beauty, which means a lot to me since I'm recovering from depression."

"*  computer

* anime & video games

* car

* plane "
"* Comics
For some reason I got really into comics in the last 3 years or so. I think the main reason is that they have A LOT of original and creative stories in this media, such as Sandman and Preacher, for example. That simply amazes me. I also like DC and Marvel superheroes stories, but I guess those are more likely to be less interesting to me (but I buy tons of them anyway, heheh).

* Mangas
Same reason: creative stories that don't appear in other media. I'm currently reading Berserk and One Punch Man, but am also interested in some others titles. Unfortunately they are all sold out, so maybe in the future I'll have the opportunity to read them.

* Books
I like most genres, but mainly a well written fantasy such as ASOIAF and The Kingkiller Chronicle. I also like to know about classics of other countries, but I do lack them in my collection.


Aside from that, which could basically be simplified as ""liking to read"", I think I don't have any other ""geek"" interests."

- as of late, Japanese movies and TV shows, particularly certain actors and actresses"
"Mathematics, Overwatch, and Choral Arranging"
I‚Äôm an absolute Metal Gear geek. I love the story; there‚Äôs plot twists throughout the game and upon replaying the games you‚Äôll notice the inconsistencies that make the twists make sense.
Martial arts and gaming. Just had my first bout of Longsword fighting with a friend on Thursday and it was fantastic. We had some great exchanges and I even got Sparks to fly off of his blade.

"Computers, history buff, photography, metal detecting, and coins. "
"I like to say that I am a numbers guy. 

Whenever I see numbers, whether it‚Äôs sports, games I‚Äôm playing, or data in general, I can‚Äôt resist the urge to want to record and graph it or make up some math problems regarding the data I see. 

I guess it satisfies me seeing a ton of numbers simplified into a small, readable format."
"About football players.  That too about upcoming stars/young players , I  don't know why but I really like young players who perform well and I like to follow their career keenly. I really don't know why I have this knack, maybe too much football manager had this effect on me."
"Warhammer Fantasy, Warhammer 40K, Judge Dredd comics."
"Many things. But if I'd have to chose one I'd say fiction. Not a fan of books really haven't read many but movies/anime/manga.    

Don't mean to brag but, I watch each one of them very carefully, relate to it, try to enact it sometimes, always try to find a deep message and learn from it. I am not a casual watcher. Give me any just any work of fiction I'd be interested enough to start watching will make me obsessed with it for a few days.  

I just love interesting stories and I'd love to make one one day. Maybe the one I'll make would be fiction or my own life if I work hard enough for it :)
"
"So Star Trek then? Correct me if I'm wrong, but that's what it sounds like."
"That's interesting, I've never seen this interest before."
Either I see you a lot on this sub or there are a lot of users into it lol. Almost makes me want to check it out!
"I'm a fan of Japanese pro wrestling  and have been for about 3 years now ever since I've watched my first NJPW match back then. I know very very little about Japanese womens pro wrestling other than the fact that Stardom is currently the biggest company there and recently some of their biggest stars are jumping ship (or have already jumped ship) to WWE.

I've seen only a few japanese women's matches from the 90s when All Japan Women's Pro Wrestling was a thing and I was quite entertained and surprised by how athletic some of the women were and that they were performing on a level that rivaled the men of their time! 

The surprise I guess was that it was such a stark difference from women's wrestling here in North America in which the women weren't even close to having matches nearly as competitive until only recently whereas these Japanese women have been on fire for basically 20+ years."
"I love the Judge Judy answer, it's very unique."
What an intriguing combination of interests.
"I'm also a geek about audio gear. An audiophile is who I am, I love my systems.

"Ooh, I have a friend who loves Nintendo games. Two actually."
"Umm, thanks?"
Any specific sports or kind of games?
"I relate on the first three, except not for comics."
LOTR for the win! Movies or books of both?
Interesting. I don't know anything about that.
I guess that's a good interest because you can get something out of it.
"I have always wanted to give Star Trek a try because it's considered a ""sci-fi geeky thing"", and I like those sorts of things."
I never read comics but I've always loved Batman.
What's it about?
That's a very interesting interest.
It's a tiny scene made up of groups of around 5 separate companies which have around 10 people each. No exaggeration. It's ridiculously niche outside of Japan. Such a damn shame because I think the stuff they put on is amazing.
"I am in here quite a lot. I also talk about it quite a lot. If you are interested, you should check it out but be aware, it's not WWE. Nothing like it."
"Stardom is getting big but there a few groups who have potential to be around the same size if they play their cards just right. One woman is currently in NXT and another is joining her very soon which is good in a way because they will get to show the world what they are capable of. I will miss the one that just left but to be honest, it clears the way for other people to fill in the gap which is interesting. AJW is something else. They wrestled the hell out of each other. Night after night. America has started to put real effort into their Women's divisions but in my mind, it's too little too late. Japan is way too far ahead at this point in time."

"Groovy.  My setup is in transition as I've been replacing some older components, but right now my sources are: an older Macbook currently with USB Audioengine DA converter (undecided on the converter), a 90s Rotel RP-855 turntable with a Nagaoka MP-110 cartridge (considering upgrading the table), a seldom used Sony CD-R, and an Outlaw Audio Bluetooth receiver to stream music while working. 

Amplification is an 80s Rotel RC-1010 preamp (considering replacement) and a Bryson 2B-LP amp. I also have a Marantz 2216B (my first decent component) and the Rotel RB-1010 amp, but neither are currently working correctly.

Speakers are now Ascend Acoustics Sierra-1s.  I'm impressed with them. 

I also have a circa-2000 set of PSB Alphas AVs hooked up to my digital piano with a small NuForce Icon amp, which was my ""get by"" system while moving around and dealing with some of life's downs.  I have a set of Paradigm 5SEs stored in the basement, which were my first decent speakers.

Regardless, pick them up tomorrow and enjoy! "

Oh my gosh that's amazing.

"Perhaps she was lonely, though you'd think she'd choose a better place, I see the NYC subway has a lot of similarities to the London underground, or British public transport in general, don't speak and don't sit next to people if you can avoid it.

>When was the last time you were confused by something you encountered?

Friday. I'm not sure here is an appropriate place to go into detail but let's just say I saw a supersized version of a certain playing implement and was confused as to why it was that big.

>How normal is it for strangers to talk to each other where you live?

Very abnormal.

>What do you do to distract yourself on long commutes?

Gaze out of the window if possible, if not I retreat to the corners of my mind.

>How good would you say you are at carrying on conversations with people in person? Be it someone new or someone you've known for a while

I get tongue-tied very easily and often run out of things to say, this is less of a problem with people I know but it still happens.

I'm actually awake this time, woop woop."
"1. n/a  I have a lot of perspectives

2. not sure since idk who is strangers and who are not.

3. I ride a bicycle, i just listen to music during my commutes

4. Just depends on the subject.  if it's about sports? i can't go anywhere.  if it's anime, video games, judge judy, etc. I can talk for hours"
"I'm Finnish, and we never talk to each other on public transport. In the rare cases that we do, both parties will probably feel uncomfortable even if the conversation is pleasant. We also never sit next to strangers unless there is no other option. It's often seen as rude but on the flipside if someone asks if they can sit there it's considered rude to say no. We're weird ~~sometimes~~ all the time about our space and boundaries. 

I was once on a bus and even though there were free seats all around us, this middle aged dude sat next to me. I'm a big guy, he was a big guy. There was not a lot of room. I felt really weird but then it became apparent he was mentally challenged and had the mind of a child. To be honest that made me even more uncomfortable, but I was less judgmental of his behaviour. Luckily he didn't try to engage me in conversation. He just sat there and acted like I wasn't even there. That suited me fine."
"> When was the last time you were confused by something you encountered?

Every day I drive somewhere I am confused by the actions of other drivers. Also enraged, disappointed, and generally just frustrated. 

> How normal is it for strangers to talk to each other where you live?

Pretty normal, I guess? It's not like we just go around saying hi to random people, but if you're standing in a long line it's entirely possible someone will start talking to you. I haven't been on the metro in many years but I think it's probably the same as the subway- you just put your head down and ignore everyone else. 

> What do you do to distract yourself on long commutes?

I try to drive as efficiently as possible while also seeing as many sights as I can (safely). Also, lots of music!

> How good would you say you are at carrying on conversations with people in person?

If we've got something definitive to talk about, pretty good! If we don't have much in common, pretty terrible. I could talk to anyone about guns or books or video games for a long long time, but I can't really do the same with shows or movies or music (well, maybe music). "
">When was the last time you were confused by something you encountered?

I don't remember

>How normal is it for strangers to talk to each other where you live?

Not normal at all, considering I'm basically in the same area as you.

>What do you do to distract yourself on long commutes?

I bring a book whenever I take the train.

>How good would you say you are at carrying on conversations with people in person? Be it someone new or someone you've known for a while

Obviously I'm better with people I've known for a while, but generally I am bad at conversing."
"> Perhaps she was lonely

Could be possible. She mentioned going to work next week, but this week was basically just a bunch of different activities (I didn't learn the rest after Coney Island) so maybe she is taking a week for herself to enjoy what NYC has to offer. She also said she was living here for a while, so it was a tourist situation. Dunno man, I hope things are going fine in her life.

> British public transport in general, don't speak and don't sit next to people if you can avoid it.

Isn't that how most of Britain works to begin with, not just the subway? :p

> I saw a supersized version of a certain playing implement and was confused as to why it was that big.

Probably imported from America, we make everything bigger for no reason

> Gaze out of the window if possible, if not I retreat to the corners of my mind.

Watching things roll by the window is always nice! I've seen the same views though from my (not underground) subway for four years now that it's not as exciting though

Letting your mind wander though, that's always fun. Just conjure up a daydream and let it play as you let everything else go by

> I get tongue-tied very easily and often run out of things to say, this is less of a problem with people I know but it still happens.

With new people that makes sense, until you find a set topic to talk about it's just a back and forth struggle looking for things to say. 

> I'm actually awake this time, woop woop.

Eyyyy!"
">Isn't that how most of Britain works to begin with, not just the subway? :p

Yeah, pretty much. You want to talk to random strangers, find a drunk one at the pub.

>Probably imported from America, we make everything bigger for no reason

Needless embiggening seems to be a speciality of the Americans.

>Letting your mind wander though, that's always fun. Just conjure up a daydream and let it play as you let everything else go by

Sometimes my mind wonders to dark places, mostly good dark, but sometimes not.

I was woken up because the power went out for a short while and my fan stopped suddenly interrupted the nice air flow I had over my feet as weirdly my feet seem to be the part of me most in need of a fan."
"I'm a resident family medicine doctor!  It took me a while to get here...

Both of my parents were doctors, so I was absolutely determined to do literally anything but that, although I did spend a ton of time volunteering in hospitals and hanging out with my dad (pediatrician) at his place of work when I was in elementary school.

In high school, I was sure I was going to be a professional musician.  I was a great percussionist and got multiple full rides to prestigious conservatories.  However, I decided that I wanted music to be a hobby.  I think I was worried that turning my passion into a career would spoil it a little.

When I was choosing a college, I was thinking hard about what career path I wanted to take.  I asked myself who had influenced me the most, and there were two answers: doctors and teachers.  So I decided I was going to be a teacher.  I loved literature, so I spent the first year in college taking English literature and education classes.

However, I discovered that it wasn't the challenge I was looking for.  So since ""teacher"" had been ruled out, I guess I might as well try ""doctor.""  I thought my parents would be proud of my choice.  They were mortified and thought I was crazy, and this was after they had fully supported my prospective careers in music and education.

I did a biochem degree in 3 years and applied to medical schools.  I didn't get in, mostly because I didn't apply broadly enough and I kind of sucked at interviewing.  My heart was broken, but I didn't give up.  I spent the next 2 years reapplying, getting my EMT license, teaching the MCAT, working as a sterile processor, shadowing doctors, and doing clinical research.  

Eventually I was accepted into medical school!  And then realized I was in over my head...  After 3 years without school, I had lost all my study skills.  I bombed the first test, hard.  I had never failed anything before, and this was devastating.  I passed the first 2 years by the skin of my teeth at the very bottom of my class (but I still passed, which some others couldn't say) and I (barely) failed my boards the first time I took them.  I passed the second time.  During my clerkship (the 3rd and 4th years) I actually did very well.  I crushed the tests and honored many of my rotations.  I loved my family medicine rotation so much that I applied for early match into the program, and they took me!

So now I'm a second-year family medicine resident, and I love it!  I know this is what I was meant to do.  I honestly love coming to work every day and seeing patients, keeping up to date on new medications and recommendations, and working with a wonderful crew of compassionate and intelligent doctors.  It's a dream come true, but boy were there a lot of tears along the way.

The next step is where to go after residency.  I hope to stay in academics because teaching is still a passion of mine, and I would love to be faculty at a teaching hospital.  Either that or set up my own practice somewhere underserved that really needs it.  But that's my story!  Thanks for asking!"
"I didn't end up in the field I went to college for. I started out heading into aviation then swapped over the business/management for my degree because I couldn't transfer to finish the mechanic program. Fast forward and I ended up getting a career in electronics. Currently waiting for a possibly interview for an engineering job to advance to. If I met myself ten years ago I would never have guessed it.  I started out wanting to do engineering, had to change degrees, went way left field from that, only to end up right back there. Getting in the door was a bit of lucky life circumstance but it was a rough several years of proving myself to get where I am. I don't really think there is a straight path for everyone, just determination to wind up where you wanted to be once you figure out what that is."
"Just odd bits and moments. I work at a place that I previously interned for but boy was it quite the journey to where i am now. It started when I was going home for the summer after my sophomore year of college. My moms friend was on the board of an organization and so i applied there and was able to intern. From there I found out about my eventual organization that I‚Äôd be working at and even got to work with my eventual boss. Loved it all and so I tried to apply for an internship there. I was rejected that initial semester. My original plan was to try and go abroad that spring semester, but instead I reapplied. This time around I got accepted after someone else rejected the offer. So I intern there while I do an e-internship for another member of the organization. I then do two more relevant internships my senior year. Overall in college, I had 8 internships and five were all about this one niche cause of the organization. 

So at the end of my senior year, I volunteer at their big annual meeting and learn they have a couple of positions opening up. I apply to both, one unofficially and one officially. Both interview me but the unofficial one asks me to pick and I choose to pick the official one. In the end they both end up rejecting me. 

I‚Äôm pretty downtrodden because I had to job search when most of my experience was only in this one niche area that just didn‚Äôt have anything opening up anywhere. So I find a temp job. I aced that interview so hard the lady found me a position immediately and it turned out to be literally the perfect position. It led me to gain the skills I needed to know, to learn the language I needed to learn. Because unexpectedly right as the temp job was ending a position opened up at that organization I interned for. It was the perfect blend between tech and the niche cause. It used the skills I had come to learn and love at the temp job. It‚Äôs given me a career that will allow me to leave the niche when the time comes and maybe even easily enter into the private sector. 

It‚Äôs been a journey but I‚Äôm in my dream job in a dream organization and couldn‚Äôt be happier. "
"Well right now I'm trying to get a job in humanitarianism and just got turned down I had applied for and volunteered at for a month and a half (5 days a week as well). Right now I'm just looking for other organizations to apply for. 

As for how I ended up where I am, I was talking to a person here about stuff they might find interesting and after recommending humanitarianism to them it occurred to me that I would really like it as well. "
I ran into multiple gates and lots of traffick. It was either fight it with the good guys with the skills avoiding it taught me....or be a victim. I chose the path less traveled and it has made all the difference
Thank you for sharing! It is wonderful to hear that you tested out so many different opportunities for yourself before finding what was the best choice for you! I hope you have an incredible trajectory from here. 
Thanks for sharing! I hope the interview pans out for you. Are you just trying to settle on a date? Or hoping to a call back? I guess the trouble I have had is finding out what I want. I had a particular path in mind and that I realized wasn‚Äôt the best idea to pursue. It‚Äôs been a few years now and I haven‚Äôt quite landed on what I want to pursue now. I know I will find it eventually!
"That is interesting! Can you tell me more about that field? Sometimes I think I‚Äôm the only non-STEM person on Reddit. Are you working for non-profits, NGOs or gov? It‚Äôs hard sometimes to transition out of a volunteer or lower-level role because people have a certain perception of you already. More opportunities will come!"
"I realized somewhere along the way that it's so, so important to constantly challenge the path you're on and what your goals are.  I recently read an article which said that, when asked if they would choose another career if they could do it all over again, 1/3 of doctors said they would.  1/3 of doctors don't want to be a doctor!!  How insane is that?!  

But I believe it; I see burnt out, bitter, cynical, and frankly lazy doctors every day.  And honestly, becoming that is my greatest fear.  But I don't think it'll happen, because I was forced to re-evaluate my goals at many points along the way.  I had to ask myself constantly, ""Are you SURE this is for you?  Are you SURE you're not just wasting your time, barking up the wrong tree, when the right path is in a different direction?""  And even when I asked myself deeply and absolutely honestly, I knew the answer was yes, and now I'm so happy I stuck with it."
"Thank you. I have to wait. The position will be open for a bit longer while they gather a pool of potential people. I hope to get an interview but I won't know if I made it that far until the opening finally closes. 

You will find out what you are after eventually. It took me a long time and I am still perusing things outside of work. Think of it this way. Your 9-5 doesn't have to be your passion or your life. It pays for your passion and life. I am not passionate about electronics and the field doesn't define me. It pays well and has benefits. For me it pays for the things I am most passionate about like art, painting, writing, etc. It is the funding for what really does count.  "
I can't say I know that much yet. I'm actually coming out of STEM to do this ironically. so far non-profit/NGO. 
That‚Äôs a good view to have. I‚Äôm sure it is helpful to have family in the same field as well. It‚Äôs great that you found that would work best for you. 
"I agree that your work doesn‚Äôt have to be your passion. However, it is a bit hard when your skills don‚Äôt align with what is valued financially. Despite what reddit thinks, not everyone is fit for the STEM field and it may take more time to be financially comfortable. Also, it‚Äôs pretty miserable doing what you dislike for most of the day 9-5. It‚Äôs just take some people more time to find that balance. Congrats on hitting that! It‚Äôs a great place to be. "

Let's not skirt around the fact that you decided to lose weight and then you totally did *exactly* that! You're a winner in my books :)
Which is a good thing!! You lost weight! Congratulations. Keep positive

"Cheers babes xxx so glad someone understands <3 So frustrating that some people just don't get it, throwing around slurs like ""This is illegal"", ""I'm calling the police"" and ""I just want my daughter back"". Some people are so thoughtless. "

I would totally get one on either the outside shoulder or inside wrist bc that sounds like it‚Äôs as good as a window into your experience as any
Thanks! I'm thinking of getting an almost empty bar to begin with and updating it annually based on life progress. I tried making a character sheet for myself when I was younger to motivate self progress like I want to advance game characters. Ink with a purpose. XD
"I totally agree, outside shoulder is something I've been leaning towards though inside wrist does sound like an interesting alternative if I get something smaller. I know from experience though that the area really hurts compared to the outside wrist. XD"
"Neat! The bar segments will fade over time, so you'll get a gradient of more pigmented bars that are more recent. 

I'd be tempted with tattooing a character sheet (like from tabletop RPGs), but I don't want something like ""Charisma 20"" on the back of my arm for the rest of my life haha.

"
Is the pain worth it is the question üòÇ what if you get it long ways on your wrist so you don‚Äôt have to sacrifice size either?
"Same! Going full on character sheet sounds great, though it takes up a lot more space and has more details that can be outdated as time goes by. I'll really have to think about what to do if I go that route! "
"I would have to agree, there was a lot of teeth gritting in the process though. XD

I'm considering expanding the exp bar idea to some sort of character sheet by now that you mention trying it lengthwise it sounds really cool. üëå"
"It seems a bit narcissistic as well :P

If I had a character sheet tattooed onto me, I'd put in jokes in the 'traits/perks' section relating to things I've done in the past few years and update it every once in a while. 

There's a group of moles on my chest that perfectly recreate the little dipper starting from my abdomen up to my right breast. I've always entertained getting a line tattooed so they make the little dipper but it would ruin the point because the moles would look like they got tattooed on. "
I actually have an inside the wrist tattoo of a M√∂bius strip that represents how my body could represent forever and bc I like shapes like that. It didn‚Äôt actually hurt too bad because my whole wrist went numb when the needle touched my skin üòÖ.
"I was thinking instead of traditional stats just go for personal accomplishments/life events, at a certain level I don't mind being self absorbed with my own skin. XD

That sounds awesome! I support this Idea. My only tattoos currently are two chains (one on each wrist) as if I was locked up. I don't notice them sometimes but I don't regret them at all. üòä"
"Ooh, I can respect it. I currently have two chains (one on each) that encircle my wrists. I like the motif and I've considered adding around my ankles and neck, though maybe that's taking too far? üòÖ The inside wrist hurt like a bitch but the outside honestly wasn't that bad. "
You could always put a level/exp bar or something and then have lines under it with meaningful or jokey perks/traits/skills that you've acquired. 
"I mean you do you man because what you want best represents you that‚Äôs why with this exp bar people will get a sense of who you are and what you cherish. The funny thing with tattoos that I‚Äôve experienced is that once you get one, you want them all."
"I'm bad at witty jokes. XD ""Mutiplied! +1 minion and 50 exp!"" for having a baby. I'd have to run them all by a jury before getting them done. Lol"

"I'm trying to improve my guitar skills. I'm completely self-taught and I have a weird way of playing so it takes a lot of work.

I have this weird habit of curling my thumb around the fret bar to play the E string. Some blues and jazz musicians do this when playing an acoustic guitar. I play metal on an electric guitar and I don't think I've ever seen anyone do this with metal. Can't tell if it's my thumb or my lack of skills holding me back. Could be both."
"One problem with my is I can't way no. And even when I do say no I feel like I'm trapped into a position of saying no I can't because I know others will look down on me or be disappointed with me..  
  
I want to be able to say no without feeling guilty when I shouldn't that's what I'm working on."
Learning about incorporating. 
"It is going to take much longer than this week, but I want to work on discussing my feelings in a healthy and productive way :) Mainly when something upsets me, how to bring it up and discuss it with my bf or friends "
"I don‚Äôt know much about guitar, I rarely ever hold my acoustic and the last time was surely at least five+ years ago. Is it possible the way you position your thumb may be your way of playing, or is that to only delete any furthering progress? "
"That‚Äôs a quality that will take you far, I can without hesitation understand how mastery can seem daunting. But life is YOUR journey, it‚Äôs YOUR adventure! Saying ‚Äúno‚Äù will cut out the people not worth being in your story, while the one‚Äôs who truly care will continue to gravitate towards you. Truly, this risk will reap you the heartful reward. :3"
"What‚Äôs incorporating? 
I looked it up, but I‚Äôm still not sure."
"Well, it's generally discouraged to use your thumb at all because it can limit you from more advanced techniques forcing you to re-learn the basics to learn the difficult ones. The only techniques that can benefit from using your thumb are inversions and even those can be played fine without it. I wish I'd known this when I started playing in the first place. Well, I'll just have shape my own style I guess.

So it's not necessarily ""wrong"", it just doesn't offer any advantages over playing regularly. It's a gimmick basically."
"It's just sometimes I want to say no and then people will be like ""Unless you know, you don't like us anymore"" as a joke or something and I know they're joking but it makes me feel like if I say no they're really going to feel that way."
"Creating corporations. LLCs. C corps, etc. "
"Then return the joke, and reassume what your goal was initially. My go-to‚Äôs when friends joke around in similar veins are, ‚ÄúOh, you thought we were friends?‚Äù or on a gentler rebuke, ‚ÄúWhen did we start dating?‚Äù 
I understand the guilt of not wanting to hurt friends, but what about the guilt of letting yourself down? You are your only constant, forever and always, my friend. "
I had never thought about it that way! Yes that does seem like the best way to do it haha

Nice!  Ive heard good things.  Dont have a PS4 but my buddies really liked that one.  Have fun and enjoy the booze!  I'm about to make myself another green ghost cocktail.  If you own a house you have to know how to make at least one cocktail, right?"
Hmm... what about a DVD built into the In-room TV. Besides Porn
But maybe.. just maybe they will have uhh an unusual fantasy with It....
I know. That's why I've stopped trying lol.
"Time is like... well I don't know what it's like, suddenly your just ambling about then your in the back of time's van with a bag on your head.

If you say so, I don't know how to make any cocktails, I spose I could just crank out the ol' search engine and look it up these days."
"Which DVD is essential that is not the porn?????

Hrrrm.

I'm not sure, I'd just put the first like, 12, seasons of The Simpsons on the TV."
"It's possible, people get hot and heavy over all sorts of things."
"Well, I mean, there's a real possibility that there could be children traveling with their parents. But the early Simpsons seems like a good choice. Got any questions for me?"
"OOOOOOh yes.

Make a wish, however your wish must cost less than 1000 of your local currency to carry out, this genie isn't really magical and is on a budget.
"
"Let's have that genie get my car re-painted. I hate the grey color that it is, I wish It could be Honda Clover Green Pearl

1,000 pesos is like 50 bucks. If I was mexican, that'd be a pretty shitty genie. "
"It is shitty genie, I know, bad genie. I dunno what I'd get for ¬£1000. Probably some... things and stuff.

Question time:

What would make you most happy in the short term?"
I have no idea. I'm content with how things are right now
"That's pretty neat. I'm not content, but I have no idea either. Well, at least no idea on the ""most"" part."
"Oh, hey. It's you (I don't pay attention to names usually)"
"Yeah, is me.

I recognise your name, from around here."
"Same. Like I said, I don't pay attention to names usually"
"I have a few names that trip things off immediately

the lady with the daily questions, the numbered posts lady, the knee jerk assumptions guy/woman. A couple of other friendly non-faces. Most names though just kinda blend into the background."
"I recognize you, u/Milkthypeg, and a few others who have since deleted their accounts :( "
"I love /u/milkthypeg 's posts, I just always seem to wake up too late to meaningfully contribute... damn timezones."
"Same. They're around midnight eastern. But honestly, I've noticed that I like the idea of things more than the things themselves, so I guess it works"
"For me they usually turn up early morning at around 6 or 7am, but I am usually still asleep at this point, by the time I'm up and ready for stuff, it's around 10am and then it just feels like the opportunity is gone."
I agree. Anything over an hour or two old is too old for me. Yet I've had posts with responses 24 hours later. 
"I comment anyway, just so I feel like I'm participating, and because she seems like a genuinely nice lady, but I don't often get replies unless I'm lucky enough to catch the post within the first few minutes."
"Alright, question for you. What are your thoughts on 'Formal' Activites like Dances, Weddings, Etc. "
"to you and /u/AkronSnape 

D'aww this conversation made me happy. And I really want to reply to the comments I've missed the for the past month, I have to dedicate all next week to it. I feel so so so so so bad for not replying as much. Do comment though on any and all posts I make, I love seeing people enjoy the posts :)"
"No thank you, I hate ""formal"" stuff with a passion, so many rules and so much pointless ritualism."
"Aww don‚Äôt feel too bad about it, life has a way of... something or other, but I do really like your posts, both reading and replying to them. "
"Yeah, I think it's stupid too. But yet, it exists, and hasn't gone away. Just an odd reminant of the past (Same thing with Marching bands)"
"People cling to the past like it'll help them, the past isn't even as certain as they'd like to think, their view is distorted.

As some video game bad guy said ""Nostalgia makes the heart feeble"".

I'm not even sure exactly what point I'm trying to make here."
Bandannas are made for golden retrievers. The are just so perfect together. Imo best pet accessory.
"Do you need a support group? Or do you just want distractions. Because I can provide you with both.


Binge watch ""Vine that cured by depression"" or ""important video"" on youtube, or /r/whatisthisthing and /r/facepalm.


Support groups at /r/raisedbynarcissists. Always friendly and contributing."
"Have you seen that 6min/14min video repost on /r/funny ?

What kind of fandoms are you a part of?
Into any types of sports? I can argue about some of them.  
"Ever hear of beach house? They are a great band. Any musik suggestions?
https://youtu.be/-3frA_rj918"
"God, you deserve better than that. Trying to maintain a peace of mind when there is anything but peace is quite a pill."
"Dude you have great taste Mac and Yellowdays, are you perhaps a fan of the Lazaylazyme daviddeanburkheart, the worst taste? üëåüèæ"
"you know, that is a concept i have never really thought about before. and after googling it... ur 100% right  "
"i'll check out those subreddits! i don't really know if i need a support group, more like just someone to talk to i guess. and i love watching vine compilations, they always cheer me up "
"I was expecting exactly the same song when I clicked in, ayy good one too"
"hmm. well i like a lot of things so, i'm a huge fan of marvel. iron man will forever be my favorite superhero, i also love the good place/parks and recreation/brooklyn nine nine! all amazing shows to watch if you haven't, michael schur is a genius at comedy. i've also been getting more and more into the game detroit become human. how about you? "
i'm kinda into hockey + baseball + basketball (but after the cousins signing...eh) feel free to argue about any of them!  
"i have not! i'll definitely give it a listen. and as for music suggestions...hm i'm a huge indie fan so i really enjoy rex orange county, vampire weekend,  hippo campus, the walters, mac demarco, yellow days...etc "
thanks. i just hate hearing people slam/hit things because it gives me pretty bad anxiety. the silver lining is that i move away for college in a month :-)
"Also check out /r/pettyrevenge, /r/prorevenge, and /r/maliciouscompliance, the top posts. Maybe /r/talesfromretail or /r/talesfromyourserver, but I guess that's enough and maybe you'll waste a lot of time :P

Captain America/Bucky girl here! I dabble in just about everything I read or watch haha. I grew up with Harry Potter so it's a big one. I had the full Lord if the Rings VHS set so it's less explored but I'm a total geek for it. Right now I'm in a bit of a slump fandom wise just because I'm so busy :(
I‚Äôm not a huge basketball fan and so I‚Äôm out of the loop about the Cousins thing.  What‚Äôs going on with that?
"Good for you to get away from it. The noise and unpleasantness can be a nuisance, particularly when those who are supposed to act like adults behave like hooligans. "
"aw man do you think captain america is going to die in the next infinity war? i hope not but i believe chris evans contract ends after infinity war part 2 D:. what hogwarts house are you? i like to think myself as a slytherin, but according to pottermore i'm a gryffindor  "
"so, the warriors who already are a powerhouse super team just signed demarcus cousins, a great player for cheap...some people think this is unfair and gives the warriors a huge advantage over the entire league. which i'll have to agree, they've already won 3 nba finals + basically it's not fun anymore because you already know who's going to win."
"Honestly I adore Chris Evans but I would also love to see Bucky take up the role, so I'm fine with whichever way they choose to take it!

I'm a Hufflepuff! By Pottermore and my own intuition (and MANY others) hahah"
"Ahh, I see. Maybe Lebron going to the Lakers will shake that up a little bit? Also, I guess it‚Äôs hard to fault any team for doing what they have to do to keep their dominance. Sucks unless it‚Äôs your team though. "
"Holy shit yes 100%! I'll break out a random Carlton here and there just to give myself a giggle. I'm a 6'4"" 220lbs gym bro geek looking guy and I think the thought of people walking in on me busting it is hysterical."
"I mean, I dance alone when sober."
"Im kinda surprised this seems to be such a well-established thing to do, judging by the comments."
you're not alone. I can tell you that. lol I do it all the time.. even sometimes when i'm sober because i think i'm cool
At least monthly. 
"I dance a lot at home, but not drunk and not always with a mirror. I just put some rock and dance, it's a good way for me to do some exercise while also listening to good music ! =)"
Love dancing/singing by myself. Feel like I'm at a huge rock concert and everyone's going nuts!
"At least everytime im drunk. Im not a dancer, but I love music, so it just controls me"
"I love when I‚Äôm drunk in a bar or restaurant and go to the toilet, having just about managed to walk in a straight line to get there, and as soon as I lock the door behind me I can stop pretending I‚Äôm sober and dance like a total spoon. "
"I don't do that when I'm drunk, I can't, drunkenness makes me feel as though I have lead limbs. I tend to just hug pieces of furniture."
"Rarely. I'll sometimes subject my poor mates to a torturous rendition of ""Lying Eyes"" by The Eagles after we've had a few too many beers, though. Don't I'm cool enough to dance around, even on my own. "
Never.my preferred drunkenly posting was on IRC
"I haven't been drunk in a long time, but I've still danced daily, and often do it in front of the mirror.  My brushing teeth and mouthwash dances are damn spiffy, pity hardly anyone's seen them.   "
"Never. drunk or sober, wouldn‚Äôt be dancing, let alone in front of a mirror. and I don‚Äôt get drunk very often, and never alone. not sure how I feel about it - at first impression it seems really pitiful, but after reading the comments, maybe just carefree"
I don't need alcohol to do that. 
I don't even get drunk and I do this. 
"If a girl - normal
A guy - weird "
Hahaha so happy I‚Äòm not the only one!I‚Äòve had my ex walking in on me plenty of times and he was like ‚Äûoh you‚Äòre doing your thing again.‚Äú
"To be honest, it makes me feel like an alcoholic for some reason o.o ? I always feel guilty afterwards."
Yay! I think I‚Äòve done it sober once but i was less creative xD
Why though? 
Lmao that's fantastic
"Alcoholics usually act like sloths, so I'd say you're fine."
I dunno. 
That made me laugh xD does that mean i‚Äòm ACTIVE?! Yes!
"This seems like a classic grief dreamüôÅ. On the other hand, it sounds like the beginning of a great sci-fi novel."
"Went to a concert yesterday with this girl I am dating. I am pretty tired today, but feeling great!"
I am sooooo boooored. Working security and got nothing to do. I hope your baby box feels better! :) 
"I was just complaining because I‚Äôm about to go to work and be by myself all evening, but then you reminded me that it is NOT my time of the month, and it put me in a better mood. Feel better! "
"I installed a subwoofer in my car and it doesn't work. -_- I reviewed the wiring, and it's all good.  I suspect an internal fault or damage in the unit.  I really don't want to have to take out all the wiring to return it to Amazon, so I'm hoping I can send the unit to the manufacturer for a warranty repair or replacement.

I was looking forward to bumping in the whip, but alas, it may be a few days."
Just got back from the gym nothing more to do in this boring as hell summer.
"I just went shopping. It was okay, came back with some things."
"I'm okay. Just drinking some coffee and watching Twitch. I wish I could have the window open so I could enjoy the thunderstorm, but it's too humid out."
"I gained 1 whole kilogram ha ha. It‚Äôs going super slowly but I‚Äôm also burning a ton of calories running, working out and swimming. Preparing for exams I‚Äôll have in December. Plus my legs hurt as f*ck from today ha ha. But I imagine it‚Äôs nothing compared to your pain. "
"Yeah, something which i didn't expect happened today. I was seeing this girl and things weren't going as usual between us. She was avoiding me for a while and i didn't take it seriously enough until today when i saw her with another guy :("
Spent some time with my family. I live in another city and don't see them that often + I will leave the country in 2 weeks and don't know when and if I will ever move back.
"hahahah  
funny way to deal with it!  
i¬¥m a master degree student and that is making me stay away from my friends cause i never have time for them.  
Never felt so lonely in my live before.. reddit is helping me to deal with it"
I slept until noon. I would have preferred another hour or two TBH.

Tbf the eating chocolate part of your post doesnt sound all that bad lol i munching on some rn

I almost passed out at work TWICE yesterday (potentially because of that)

Stay strong!! It'll be over soon :)))"
"I‚Äôm in the same boat as you, Aunt Flo is visiting....I‚Äôve just done all my laundry. My daughters are giving each other makeovers. Husband is mowing the lawn. Thinking about making a drink and sitting on the porch! üçπ"

"I'm having a lot of headaches these days and can't study, but other than that things are awesome, haha.

Hope you are doing well!"
"Came back home today after a 2 week long vacation in Europe. I‚Äôm really exhausted and have some jet lag (It should be 11PM right now, but it‚Äôs only 5 since I‚Äôm back home). I learned a lot about how other countries/cultures work and a new outlook on life.

What about you, anything happen that you‚Äôd like to share?"
hello
"So this is the only reason I'm glad I'm a transgender woman. I'll take the terrible dysphoria to not have to go through all that, since I have no interest in reproduction anyway. Sorry you're having a rough time :("
"Ugh, I know that feeling....hang in there girl!!!"
"I gotta know, Is the pain during the actual bleeding, or leading up to the bleeding? Or is it a more like a crescendo? When exactly do these cramps ""kick in""?

Also. Im sorry for your pain."
"Today i did nothing :\ i didn't get enough sleep today, so i am not in the mood of do anything productive. So what i did was pass all the day listen music and redditing."
"Today I started turning my life around! :)

I'm trying to exercise more and make my body more healthy for my futures sake."
"Hey do you feel better now 
"
Great! I'm happy for you :)
Aww thank you! :)
"Haha, I'm happy to hear that you will not have pain for a week! Sometimes I really wish to be a boy.."
Oh I'm sorry to hear that :/
"I really hate summer, I can't stand the sun and the heat :/"
"Hope you had a great time, even if it was only shopping!"
I really love thunderstorm! I prefer those over this sun and heat.
"Legs' pain are annoying as well, but hope you'll feel better soon! :)"
"Oh I'm sorry to hear that, but don't be sad, or I'll be sad as well :("
"Oh wow, where are you going after these 2 weeks?"
Oh I'm sorry to hear that :/
"Lucky you, I really envy you."
"I'm really sorry to hear this, I can't imagine what are you going through right now,and if you want to talk about it, here or privately, I'll be very happy to listen and be there for you. I've been through a lot myself, so you can talk to me or someone you feel comfortable with."
The only problem is that I'm too lazy to get up and get it hahaha
"My god, I hope you feeling better now?"
That will be really relaxing!
"I really wish I could go out too, but I'm one of those lazy piece of crap haha"
Thank you and hope your headaches will be gone soon! :)
"Not really, nothing happened that is particulary interesting but I really want to know in wich european country have you been this past 2 weeks?"
Hi!
"Thank you and don't worry, I'm a tough girl! :)"
Thank you girl!
Nice doctor questions doc 
"Lol, well the pain is during the bleeding AND before the actual bleeding. The cramps came every 4-5 minutes or, sometimes, there's no pause between cramps. It sucks so much being a girl :("
"That's me al the time, during summer I can't find the will to do anything."
I'm happy for you! :)
Not really but thank you for asking! :)
"What about you, dude?"
Same here I just miss feeling the rain on my body(well technically clothes).
"It was an okay time, I did get a big bottle of vodka for myself though so I‚Äôm just going to get wasted tonight. It‚Äôs been ages since I‚Äôve been wasted. I feel like I relate to your username on a deep level haha."
Me too! I wish we could get them more often.
"Well, it sucks! 

I've been bouncing around for years until i decided to spend the rest of my life with her. But hey..........................."

I guess just grab the nearest food item near u ik thst always cheers me up lol"
"I am, thank you! I hope you're feeling better now too!"
Just trying to decide what to haveü§î wine? Or go fancy???
"I actually toured around Europe. It would‚Äôve been a better idea to just stay in 1 or 2 countries the whole trip, but my family wanted to see as much as possible because they‚Äôre afraid we‚Äôd never go back as a family again. We went to Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Netherlands, France"
"I'm just watching Jojo with my mom and my brother, nothing much :/"
"Same, I love rain so much!"
"Lol, I've never drank alcool in my life but I hope you have fun :)"
I'm really sorry..
Really nice :)
"Well, currently is 10:30 PM and I've done nothing all day because of all these cramps and I'm sweating like crazy:/"
"I really can't sleep that much, I always wake up before 8 :/"
"Don't be so hard with yourself, I had a situation very similar, but she was my friend, so I'm sad that you're going through the same. Sometimes it's better going on with your life and leave those people out, because they're gonna hurt you everytime you're with them."
"Food always cheers me up as well, I love eating so much hahaha"
I am and thank you :)
"Go fancy girl, always the best haha"
"That's pretty awesome, but you should've come to Italy too so you could have visited me haha"
"That's awesome, dude. Jojo rocks!"
"Dude, your mom watches Jojo. That is awesome."
"Oh I will.

Or my liver will explode.

We‚Äôll see."
"Hey, It's okay. Calm down. Why are you being sorry? You did nothing. "
"My syster had those crazy pms until she got her IUD. It¬¥s a life changing!
now i¬¥m curious... where are you from?"
"You have my condolences üòÄ

That said, I have trouble waking up before 9 and makes it difficult to live if I have a job that requires it. No amounts of sleep schedule erases the fact that my body just ""wakes up"" around 9pm and I don't get tired until 2 or later. Even on days I've woken up early it still happens."
"Thank you, and thanks for listening to my rambling... I appreciate it."
"I would‚Äôve loved to go to Italy, it was just too much of a drive. How is it there this time of year?"
"She really loves it, and I'm so happy that we're watching it together! :)"
"Well I'm sorry to hear that you're sad because of that girl. Maybe the hormones are speaking, but I don't like seeing sad people, because I always happy or being positive, so I'm sorry that I can't do anything to make you happy."
"I'm from Italy, so my english it's not the best if you ask me :)"
Thanks for the condolences hahaha
"You're very welcome, and if you need to talk about anything I'll gladly listen :)"
"Hot, really hot, but really relaxing as well, or at least here where I live!"
"Its probably the hormones. Nah, don't worry about me, i'll be just fine. I just need someone to fine tune me haha.

Anyways, what's up?"
"I¬¥m not a native english speaker as well, so no judgment here!
i asked because of the time difference. I realized you should be from Europe! =]"
"I'm fine now, I think, besides I'd hate to impose on you.

Just...

I've been thinking about your words and the situation itself for a few hours now. It's probably for the best to keep distance.

Anyway, I hope your pain went away, and you are feeling better."
It‚Äôs really hot in the US too. The weeks I was gone it was 90+F constantly. I came back to burnt grass everywhere. Is the shore not far from where you live though? I‚Äôd imagine the beach would be a cultural thing in Italy since it‚Äôs a peninsula and all
"I have some cramps right now that hurts pretty bad, but other than that I'm all good!"
"Yeah, currently is 11 pm, pretty late."
Thank you and I wish the best for you :)
"Yeah I live 30 minutes from the beach, but it's not really pretty because here where I live the water is not clear at all. :/"
"Oh, That must be awful. Hope you're holding up?"
are you feeling better now?
"Is the water normally clear in Italy? The only places I know that have clear water are the Bahamas, and certain beaches in the US that get clear sometimes"
"Of course, I'm a tough girl, I'm not going down with a little pain haha"
"Well, in the south the water is really clear and beautiful, in the north too, in the central part of Italy, some beaches are really dirty so that's why I don't go to the beach usually."
"Attagirl! 

So, you're into video games i see?"
That sucks. What about things like lakes with beaches?
"Yeah, I really like playing videogames, but with this heat I can't find the will to play anything :/"
There are none here where I live :/
"I understand. Usually, what games do you love to play?"
I‚Äôm sure the beaches can‚Äôt be *that* bad though. Just keep looking at the ocean and you won‚Äôt even notice that bad parts!
"Well, my favorite of all time is The Witcher 3, and Mass Effect 1-2-3, I also played Fallout 4 but I'm taking a break because, as I said, I don't wanna do anything with this heat."
"Maybe you're right, thanks :)"
Wise choices i would say. Did you check out the new Fallout 76? What do you think?
"I'm not really into online game, I prefer playing solo, and I don't really like it. If all the people came from the same Vault, why would they want to kill each other? I don't really understand and that's why I don't really like this new Fallout :/"
"Me neither. Once everybody gets their hands on the nukes, they gonna nuke everybody's shitty shacks they spent hours on left right and center and one guy who's gonna be pissed is going to spend the rest of his life everyday for a hour or so nuking the shit outta you."
Yeah it's pretty dumb if you ask me.
Yep!
"> I do love meeting people but I feel like I intimidate others or is just not that interesting for other people. 

>What I meant of being that ‚Äòfriend‚Äô is that I feel like I am the one in the group who always adjusts to other‚Äôs needs.

Reading this I really see my 20+ year old self within this post, hah.  My two cents of advice is you really have to take care of yourself first and foremost.  No one person is going to be there for you 100% and folks will come and go through your life.  You can still have close friends that you connect with deeply but those come (more frequently) after you learn to love yourself more otherwise people tend to take advantage of your good nature.  Taking advantage of you isn't malicious but it's like if I always do the dishes every day and then suddenly stopped and got mad that my wife wasn't helping.  My wife isnt a horrible person for not helping, she just became accustomed to me doing it every day and didn't really think about it.

So rather then aim to meet and befriend people instead go out and do hobbies that you enjoy.  Tackle hobbies you've never tried and go to events around town.  Chat with folks not to become friends but rather just to be sociable and get to know people.  Don't try to just meet people you're attracted to - be awesome to everyone and learn to be happy being alone.  Once you're okay with that suddenly people wont leave you alone, haha.

Anyways Ill get off my soapbox.

"
"I'm 28 now but I had a relationship like that. He was supposed to be my best friend and we had a lot of history together, but in the end it felt like I was the one making all the effort to stay connected. So I decided it wasn't worth it and I stopped and I waited to see if he'd call back. He didn't. So I didn't and then finally I get a pissed phonecall 1-2 years later demanding why I didn't tell him I moved home, well, you never bothered before so I didn't. Now it's my fault? whatever. 

There's loads of back story but that is it pretty much in a nutshell. interested? I got loads more."
"I don't really feel like I intimidate people, but I'm really awkward and bad at talking to people so it's hard to actually become close to people. Sometimes it feels like all my ""friends"" are really just acquaintances who sometimes include me in things to be nice because they feel bad or something."
"I recently have been thinking about this and came across [this](https://pca.st/0WEQ) podcast that I found somewhat reassuring/helpful.

You are definitely not alone in feeling this way!"
"I completely understand. I just transferred to a university as a senior and I can't really seem to make a close connection to anyone, not even co-workers. My friends back home can walk up to strangers and speak to them as if they'd known them for years, but I've been at this school for a few months and can't even get someone to remember my name..."
"Haha thanks, man! I can say I‚Äôm working on taking care of myself more the past few months. Still, the frustration is there though. But I think you are right about enjoying things I would want to do and just being sociable in general. It‚Äôs a work in progress but I hope things will look better soon üôÇ"
"Thanks for sharing, man! Sounds like you have some pent up emotions and so much history, man. Sad on how it went through though. 

But I‚Äôm glad you had someone to call as your best friend. Never had one and it‚Äôs pretty sad to think about it. Haha"
"I understand how that ‚Äòacquaintance‚Äô feeling feels like. I know friendships are a two way effort but when I think about it, in a circle group of friends, I‚Äôd get picked last since they all have better friends than I am. And it‚Äôs not because I‚Äôm sucky but because simply that‚Äôs the case. I think I haven‚Äôt found my best friend yet so that makes it difficult. (I don‚Äôt want it to feel like a necessity but it just feels like one sometimes üò©)"
Thank you! Will check it out üôÇ
"Yeah, man, some people just have that easier and figured out than us. 

I think we need to give ourselves a break, lower our expectations in meeting people and just try to be more sociable to everyone while doing the things that we want and enjoy. At least, that‚Äôs what I got from the responses and I think it‚Äôs true since being self-aware is more likely to help us move from this. "
"Its definitely tough and I know my words that you probably already know dont fix much - I guess I always look back to my 20s and realized just how much I was trying to be this ""good guy"" who just wanted friends when I wasn't taking advantage of just doing the hobbies and conversations I wanted to have.

But thats friggin awesome that you're working on it and yeah vent away - its never an easy experience and people can be incredibly fickle.  Just keep filling your plate with volunteer work, events, work, book clubs, movie night, biking tours whatever suits your interests and eventually you'll find the ones that are less inclined to bail.

Any new cool hobbies you found as of late?  Anything you're hoping to try out in the next few weeks/months?"
"I dunno, though. I don't have many friends now, if any at all. I have my wife, my two children who I love dearly and means the world to me,  and my work colleagues. That's it. I don't trust to bond with other people on a personal level. "
"Thanks for the encouragement! You seem really positive about this since you‚Äôve been through the same thing yourself. 

For the hobbies, idk I have to think about it first (I‚Äôm more of a house buddy so it‚Äôs bit of a challenge too) I hope to try out many things though (maybe audition and be part of a theater play, do more volunteer work)"
"Have you tried reconnecting with your best friend or is it a closed chapter now? 

I respect that. You seem pretty content and happy so I‚Äôm glad you have that going in your life. "
"Oh, no, it's definitely a closed chapter now. You say you're 20? Are you in work? For someone such as myself, work is pretty much the only avenue I'd get of meeting people, so it's definitely a great help if you are. 

You probably have more in common with your colleagues than you realise. It took me a year and half to realise that a colleague of mine & I share a common interest. So now we meet up every fortnight or so and do that. It's pretty great.

I'd recommend it. "
"Agreed, man. Yeah, I do have some close friends at work. I think I‚Äôm just looking for something more constant and mistakingly looking it over the company of some friends. "
"Also from the UK. 18-21 was good fun. 22-26 was great. 27-30 was an absolute disaster, but it's slowly gone uphill since then. 36 and I don't think I've ever been happier. 

No doubt the universe will conspire against me at some point in the near future, but it feels like I'm in my prime now."
"Myself and every other guy I've ever known seemed to agree that the best years of our lives were around our late 20s. We're not worrying about the pressures of school, we have the financial freedom to go out and have fun every once in awhile, and women seemed to find us more fetching when we have a little more years to us. 

Then again, I'm only 31 so I could probably have a lot more to look forward to as well. Could be the same for you too."
"idk. I find it's usually the relatively young (30 +/- 5) who wax poetic about being 18 again. perhaps it's because they can *remember* it far better than a 50 year old. or, relatively speaking, it does look attractive, as opposed to one's stereotypical late 20s & 30s, when all The Responsibilities are all yours.

but, passing through and mostly conquering or at least coming to terms with all that (the foundations of kids, careers, finances) i gotta say I wouldn't go back to being 18 for anything short of a billion dollars. my 40s were fucking stupendous, and my 50's only shine with at least as much promise.

and anyway what's the point. I'm never gonna be short. I'm never gonna be a runner. and I'm never gonna be any younger. make hay while the sun shines. "
"""Prime of life"" is a completely meaningless catch phrase."
"I think this is a 'thing' as we look back on the past with rose-tinted lenses. Anyhow, turned 26 this year if that's anything to go by.

This year started off rocky as hell for me (diagnosed with depression, stuck with a job I didn't like) but got better once I addressed a few issues- got therapy help, got a job I wanted, forcing myself to be more social. 

While I don't have as many friends as I did when I was in high school, my interactions with my colleagues and acquaintances feel more genuine. Still working on myself but I feel better than I have in  many years.

So a rambling story cut concise- the 'prime' of your life doesn't really count for much since life has its ups and downs."
"Pretty relatable, had a lot more insecurities at the end of my teens than in my twenties! 

Did you actively look for solutions for your issues or did they kind of solve themselves?"
"Oh, very much so.  Life's getting better as I get older.... "
"Yup! I had a kid at 18 and spent years working and going to school and building the life he deserved. Had no fun and no social life. 

That kid is now 15 and in the last few years I‚Äôve had the chance to make some great friends. I‚Äôm now madly in love with a wonderful man. I feel like I finally have all the things I always wanted. "
I‚Äôm 30 and feel more energetic and happy and prepared for shit then I ever have 
"I feel you, man. I was severely depressed through most of it too. Unsure about everything including myself. Still minorly depressed now, on and off, and still minorly unsure about everything. But I'm only 22, so I think I'll figure it out."
"Oh yes.  For me, the ""prime of my life"" was 30-onward.  I grew some self-confidence, overcame a lot of my psychological issues, and just became happier in general.  I'm in my forties now and still feel like I'm in the prime of my life. "
"I am right there with you. 18-21 was tough, and I hadn't really ""discovered "" myself yet. My good years were from about 25-30. "
I am 44. I am definitely in a better place than I was at 21. Both financially and in my confidence 
"Great to hear so many of these answers. I'm 22 now and I believe the best is yet to come. I think it's also the mindset you approach life with and the clarity you gain on things...

You're in a much better spot because you know yourself more and you have a clearer idea of what you want to do/not do..."
"My life certainly hasn't been conventional but I will say 20-25 was more my peak. Since it's been pretty shit, but I enjoyed my hobbies more, went out more, eventually had a friend move into his own place where we would hang. Then and now is like day vs night"
"Korean here

Prime of life here is mid 30s

Fuck me right"
Yeah I think it's more the mid-20's. At least it was for me.
"i‚Äôm only 19, about to turn 20 in less than 3 months, & so far it‚Äôs been tough. it‚Äôs getting a little bit better for me the older i get, but i‚Äôm still kind of lost on who i am & what i want out of life. it‚Äôs not starting to look like the prime of my life."
"I just did dumb shit and was still kid enough to not worry about consequences

Now I do my drugs at home like a grown up"
"Completely agree. I'm 25 now and I've never been as happy and independent than I am right now.

I would actually argue that 15-18 was the shittiest time so far for me. "
"Also from the UK and this is what I've been thinking about pretty regularly. I'm in my last year of Uni but I commute due to how much living costs are, among a ton of other stuff and I feel that I've missed out on a ton of things whilst not being there. 

Also, I've lost a couple of family members to illness throughout the last few years and it's been rough. 

I've got a great group of friends but they all live a few towns over and we never really do anything all together, and although I've met some amazing people from Uni that I'm close with I can't help but feel that I could have done so much more with this time, I feel like I've just pissed it away really. 

But oh well, I'm working on living a bit more and I'm looking forward to see what my 20s bring.  "
"I'm pretty much in the same boat, friend. I remember being at my college graduation party and saying to family members that what everyone describes as ""the best four years of my life"" are over so it's all downhill being a boring adult from here. 

But I struggled with some mental health stuff through the first three years of college and I think I was still in a high school mentality and now that I've graduated, I think I'm growing into more of my own person and discovering who I really really am. I've lost over 20lbs, putting me at a lighter weight than I ever was in college, and I'm just all around a happier, better person. "
"What? Who says this? Making a sweeping statement about what years the best of someones life is a silly thing to do. You still haven't lived all of it. I guess we tend to romanticize the past pretty heavily, so we might look back on the times when we had the most memorable fun as the best, even if the the majority of that time wasn't great. Like, when I look back at high school, I generally remember it pretty fondly, I think about that feeling when you are sitting in the last class of the day on the first really warm sunny day of the year, hanging out in the computer lab playing Magic: the Gather or StarCraft Broodwar, or just wondering around with friends and not worrying about anything. Those are the things I choose to remember, but they sure as shit are a fair representation of what it was actually like. A majority of my time there was spend pissed off, unhappy, alone, and stressed. But when I look back, the first thing that comes to mind is the good, even though there was decidedly less of it. I think for most people it's the same with their late teens-early 20s. You remember hanging out with friends, going out on weekends, staying up late, what it was you enjoyed at the time. Everything in between those memories might have been dull, or down right not enjoyable, but that does't always leave a lasting impression. The past is polarizing, we tend to either remember the best of it, or the worst of it. "
"I'm hitting my peak now, actually.

I was severely overweight, heavy depression in my teens.  My 20s genuinely sucked.

Im 31, lost almost all the weight (another 30 pounds to go), got my money right, my career right and my passions right.  I ride my bicycle a lot and eat healthier than I have in twenty years.

I wish my hair wasn't going grey quite THIS early, but considering the stress levels I had the past three years I'm just glad it's not coming out in clumps."
"18-21 was *not* the prime of my life. I'm 30 and I feel like I'm slowly coming into my prime now. 18-21, for me, was just about being stupid and drunk, with a few exceptions (married at 20, first child at 21). Several of my elders claim that their 40's were their best years. As much as I don't look forward to aging (I'll only admit being 30 on reddit haha), I do look forward to more wisdom, more possibilities, and more gain for the future. "
"According to everyone else's comments, it's okay that life is blah at 19. I guess I have some thing to look forward to. So I have that going for me at least."
"I‚Äôm 26 and I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôve hit or passed my prime yet i know it sounds weird, I guess I just gotta get out of my funk and put myself out there, glad your doing better OP hopefully I hit my upswing soon"
Absolutely. Feel like my prime has just started and will rise for a long while.
"Yeah, those weren't my prime years. I enjoyed college but had a lot of issues with doubt, anxiety, and depression. Life got much better when I started seriously addressing those issues."
"Personally, highschool was ok, college was a gauntlet of work and tests and now 23+ is amazing. I landed a good job that ENDS AT 5. I was so astonished the first few months, nights to myself.   A crazy thing. "
Mine was 24 to 30
18-21 wasn't bad but if that was the peak of my life then I'd be very disappointed.
"Appearance-wise those were pretty good years even though i didn't realise it at the time but otherwise those were very shitty years filled with self-doubt and emotional issues. Currently i'm doing good and feel the most self-assured and grounded than I ever have but i think i've still got a ways to go. For some reason though, I have this image of my early 30's being the period where i really have my shit together."
"The best time of my life started last August and I'm 26. Prior to that, it was a lot of just going through the motions and sorta stumbling along."
Mine was 25-35. And I‚Äôm 41.
"I'm 27 now.  The last year is probably by far the best of my life, and I'm still working on a getting some things in order so hopefully 28 will be even better.  25 and earlier basically sucked in comparison.  I think I'm on track for my 30's to be my prime, which means I've got something to look forward to."
"I'm 21 right now and it definitely seems that way! Now I know I am young enough to be currently in the supposed ""prime age"", but I can already tell (in the most humble way possible) that I have so much potential ahead of me. I'm in a really good spot physically, mentally, professionally, and financially, all things considered. I'm not by any means saying I have everything figured out, far from it really. But I realize that there are so many opportunities and experiences ahead of me that life is only going to get better with time."
Abandoned. 
"Why a disaster, if you don't mind me asking?"
31 is a good age.  Old enough to know better but young enough that the treadmill still males a difference.
"Supposedly people in their 40's have the best sex of their lives, but they could be kidding themselves."
I agree. 
I'm in a similar situation- how did you force yourself to be more social? I'm trying to meet like-minded people but holy hell going to events alone terrifies me üêï
"I continued to workout regularly, look after myself, stay clear of drink and drugs, work on my hobbies and not chase women - but perhaps most importantly I got therapy. This past 7 weeks has drastically changed my mental state!"
"Lost a job that I'd been working really hard at, didn't have much in the way of savings, there was no money coming in. Had to dig in deep to get myself out of that situation. It was a miserable time."
Remind me in 19 years and I swear I'll let you all know how it goes. 
"Just keep confronting the negative 'what if...' thoughts with 'so what?' responses. That helped me get out, then focusing on things like how blue the sky was or the thing I wanted to do helped. I've not met anyone yet but I'm out of the house more often and that's a good thing.

I'm not a qualified therapist but I'd recommend seeing one and getting some strategies to overcome the anxiety"
"You should watch The Girl Who Leapt Through Time if you haven't already. The anime movie, not the Live Action adaptation which is pretty bad."
Love groundhog day Bill Murray is a legend
"Your Name is, in my opinion, the best animated movie of all time"
"If you want to go even further, try out The Shape of Voice. That one messed me up pretty bad, but not in a bad way. People compare it and Your Name I think, but this one's more grounded in reality with no supernatural stuff. I did love that about Your Name though."
"I love both films, but Your Name is the best animated film (2D or otherwise) I've seen. 10/10. I don't consider it a chick flick though. Yeah, it's about romance, but there's so much more.

If you haven't, check out 5 Centimeters per Second."
"I've heard of Groundhog day but never got around to watch it, and i rented ""Your Name"" on the Itunes store a couple of months ago. The movie was truly a masterpiece. "
I worked in punxsutawney lol
"You may appreciate this song from Your Name, the lyrics are beautiful - https://youtu.be/0FW6ddWwhy0 :)"
"Your Name left me speechless and I'm tears afterwards, and I never cry at anything. I've been listening to the soundtrack and it's helped me through so many slightly darker nights."
"Yeah, second this. It plays with a lot of smiliar themes, and itbgit ne a bit emotional too."
"I did actually

That last scene

https://youtu.be/ifsnD6AFEeA?t=5187

cries"
Its a shame it couldn't hold a candle to the live action garfield
"Lol

No way

I yhought they just made that up"
It gave me The Sweaty Eyes really bad.
Yeah..............
no its a real place just not the place thats in the movie the real town is small but famous its very real
"I'm drinking by myself and generally being a mouthy redditor as my 2 friends are otherwise unavailable

My IRL friend, is prolly tired out from a music thingy he just went to.

My online friend has gone away. Just away. She'll be back, but she is away."
I‚Äôm staying home. Maybe I‚Äôll order some takeout. 
Came to another city which is 130 miles far to chill with my friends of this city. And in few hours moving ahead again 140 miles for a road trip cum attending batchmate wedding.
I am watching a movie about Bigfoot called Big Legend. Surprisingly watchable. Better than i hoped.
"Right now I'm just chilled out on the couch, listening to Ninja Sex Party. Why them, I'm not sure; I've listened to many different bands already this evening. But if you need a recommendation, Orgy for One is a great song. 

I'm alone too, and I'm just going to relax. Probably watch some shows. "
I‚Äôm going to this party / kickback tonight in Los Angeles. My old high school crush invited me so damn right I‚Äôm driving there. Tomorrow I believe I am going to Disneyland for my aunts bday before my annual pass expires and I don‚Äôt renew it. Then back to work on Monday woot.
It's 7am. I haven't slept. I'm just waiting for my eyes to tell me to shut off.
"Drinking by myself! One of my best friends from undergrad, who I like, has a girlfriend. He lives several states away, and I know we'd never really work (or maybe we would?), but it still hurts. 

I think I'm gonna find a movie to watch, or maybe I'll just read. But cheers to spending the night at home alone!"
Playin Rust alone hoping some dicks don't ruin my night
"At the bar alone, friend is supposed to be updating me if we're going out but have a feeling it won't happen."
"Read, helped mom move, saw family, went to dinner, now home again relaxing. It's too hot out to do much else. I enjoyed getting to hang out with the kiddos of the family this afternoon. Now I'm hoping to be able to finish the book I'm reading as I only have about 50 pages left. "
Working till 11 my dude. What's up.
I cancelled a first date with a 44 year old woman. I'm 31. Now I'm watching How It Ends on Netflix. 
Lol I‚Äôd be drinking too but I‚Äôve still got a year till I‚Äôm allowed to buy it legally and my stash has run dry 
"Be thankful you live in an area where you can get food delivered, I live out in the country so I don‚Äôt get that luxury "
Damn that‚Äôs a lot of driving lol
Is it on Netflix?
Don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever heard of that band but with a name like that I‚Äôve gotta listen to them
"Good luck with your crush tonight, and say hi to Micky for me lol"
Turn off the phone and turn on some quiet music my dude you need some sleep
Cheers right back my dude
Lol I‚Äôve heard that came is full of colorful characters 
Well hopefully he shows up and you two have a great night 
What are you reading?
"Eating popcorn and watching YouTube, how‚Äôs work going"
"I'm 22 and British, I've been legal for over 4 years, haha.

Being drunk is nice, but don't do it too often, your liver will write you a strongly worded letter of complaint, and it'll stop being fun if you do it too much."
Yeah! But two of friends are accompanying me to drive the car. 
"I ""found"" it online."
"Oh yeah, you should. My brother told me about them recently, but they've been around since like 2010. They're a comedic duo, and they have a lot of weird and raunchy songs that are often dumb in a good way. Plus some awesome covers. "
What's your favorite drink?
Depends on the server i think but most of them are shite i think. I stay to beginner ones or at least no kill on site
**The Couple Next Door** by Shari Lapena. 
Sounds like you got it made. I'm on hour 14 of my 16 hour shift and I've caught my 3rd wind. It's all gravy from here.  What YouTube are you getting into?
"Yeah being an American means I‚Äôm stuck waiting till I‚Äôm 21, and don‚Äôt worry lol I‚Äôve had my fair share of hangovers and they‚Äôve made me become more a chill drinker then a party drinker"
Oh yeah that‚Äôll definitely make it go by faster 
"Just listened to Orgy for One, definitely gonna be spending my night listening to all their songs, thanks for the recommendation!"
"Awhile ago a friend made me a drink that was Mountain Dew mixed with honey bee jack Daniels that I really liked, once I turn 21 though I‚Äôll be able to expand my tastes though lol"
Seems like a good way to not get fucked over
"I‚Äôll have to look into that, been awhile since I‚Äôve read a book"
"I‚Äôm currently watching a video about some movie news, where do you work that you‚Äôve gotta go for  16 hours?"
"I just like to get very very drunk, not very frequently.

Though frequency of drink may increase as I have graduated am nutjob, don't know where to go in life and stuck in rural England.

rural England is shit, pls avoid living there."
"Nice, glad you liked it! You're welcome. "
"Hahaha! I really like Jack Daniels, can't go wrong with it!"
"I'm enjoying it so far! It's a pretty quick read, too. "
"I love diving into YouTube. I watch it more than Netflix.  I work at a hospital, but I'm not on reddit while taking care of patients so no worries. "
"Trust me rural Ohio is no fun either, unless you‚Äôve got a fetish for corn fields, but good luck on figuring out your life "
Good to know lol I‚Äôll look into it
"Oh yeah there‚Äôs plenty of stuff on YouTube and I can never find anything good to watch on Netflix, and it‚Äôs good to hear that no one is dying thanks to this conversation lol"
"Corn....

nah, can't get fetish there.. it comes out in your poo, how can I fetish something that isn't polite enough to be dissolved by stomach acids.

Stupid corn, bastard... non-dissolving poopmonkey... bleurgh"
I love watching people build things. It gives me satisfaction like I've done any actually work.
If that ain‚Äôt your thing we‚Äôve got a fuck-ton of beans too lol
I take it your a fan of Primitive Technology?
"Yea! That's a good one.  I Make Stuff, and Black Magic Craft are both great. "
"I‚Äôll have to check out the other two don‚Äôt believe I‚Äôve ever heard of them, if you want to watch something more on the comedy side of building William Osman and Michael Reeves are great"
"Oh man Will! Did he ever get a new place? Last I heard was when his house burned down.  I hope he did, dude was talented."
"He is currently living in a RV at his parents house lol, but hopefully he‚Äôll be able to move back into a real house soon"
If you‚Äôre not crazy fussy then freeze portions of what you cook so you can mix and match throughout the week - you can somewhat reduce your portion size when cooking while still making the act of cooking itself worthwhile.
"If the super market have a discount on some meat, I buy enough so I have for a couple of days and then I freeze most of it down, so I have for another day. That is what I do, idk if that was what you meant?"
The only real cooking I do is fry meat on a skillet. Occasionally I also put chicken in the oven. I fucking love chicken. I used to like pork but I've eaten so much of it that it tastes like cardboard nowadays.
Hmm how long do you keep it in the freezer till you think it‚Äôs gross? I‚Äôve always been a sole believer of only icecream in the freezer at the most frozen packaged vegetables
"Until I need it, meat can be frozen down ofc. As long as it frozen down nothing will happen to it. Meat can be frozen down for months without nothing happening to it."
"You're in quite a pickle. Pulled in two directions with reasons to remain and leave. But it appears the scale is balanced at staying as opposed to leaving, even though where you are in life seems rife with complications that leave you less than happy."
r/advice
"It‚Äôs so amazing that you have this crossroads, is it not exhilarating to have the world literally at your feet? You may not consider yourself smart enough or strong enough but it is human nature to improve, i genuinely believe you have a gift to enhance the experiences of those around you. The fact you are willing to question it is enough to convince me that you are doing the right thing."
"Personally I think putting a timeframe on getting married/having kids is usually not a great idea. Trying to force something like that in your life will just cause you stress because you'll always be thinking about it since you're trying to stick to a ""plan"" for life, and life isn't something you can plan out like that (to a certain degree yes, but you just never know what's going to happen). 

From what it seems you two aren't on the same page, so if you really want make sure you have a family within the next ~5yrs, you need to find someone else. OR you need to relinquish control and take the planning down a notch (this is coming from someone who used to be a super ""go with the flow"" type and then became more a planner, and then found a good balance of the two). Especially since you want to get a new career AND finish your degree, trying to put a family in the mix is just asking for unnecessary stress and disappointment. I'm not saying it *can't* be done, I'm just saying it'll be extremely difficult and is unnecessary to all do at once. Focus on one at a time. If it were me, I'd try to find cheaper housing and work at whatever shitty job I could get while I worked on my degree, and then focus on career. I don't know what career you want, but that could also affect your timeframe for having a family, especially if you're wanting to have a baby yourself instead of adopting.

Also, strictly from this post (considering I know nothing else about you), it seems like you left your hometown, had an awful experience, and then after going back home to recover, are having a really hard time making yourself leave again because you feel comfortable/safe there. I'd never tell someone they *have* to leave somewhere they feel safe, but going out into the world is good for everyone. It gives you life experience, you see/understand other cultures, meet people and have adventures you'd otherwise never get the chance to have. Regardless of whether it's with your boyfriend or not, I'd recommend leaving at some point.

Lastly, again strictly from just this post, I'm assuming you're young, like mid-20's. If that's the case, you have SO much time. There's no reason to plan out those huge life events in such a way that you start to feel bad if you don't accomplish X in Y amount of time. I totally thought I'd be married with kids by the time I was 25. Well guess what? Now I'm well past 25 and still not married/kids, but life is pretty good! So if I were you, I'd try to find some balance and dip into your ""go with the flow"" side occasionally, starting with small things. Cheers!"
"Seems like you two are just not in the same stages in life. He seems like he‚Äôs got a lot going on career wise and is working towards that. And no offense, you seem kinda all over the place. If you aren‚Äôt in the right place right now, not having your degree yet, having baggage from a abusive relationship, and struggling career wise than I would worry about you two helping each other get to a stable stage together. Him moving is probably gonna help the both of you if he has a good job he‚Äôs moving to. Moving might just help you career wise. Honestly kids would be the last thing I‚Äôd be thinking about in your situation and is the wrong thing to be thinking about when making this decision. "
I agree I also wouldn't mind him moving out there getting stable and then me joining when I can. Hes moving in 2 weeks while the earliest I would be able to would be in about 2 months.
I'm also trying to think long term as living here in my current situation only seems to be ok in my present circumstances. 
Thank you! What do you believe is my best path?
Thank you so much for the advice! I'll try and just go with the flow as it seems that's all I can do for now.
Hmm ok 
I wish I could give more information as it may seem from my post he has it going for him career wise but that's not the case. I cant say too many details on a public post.
"If you two feel this can work, that sounds ideal. Secure your college results, find a temporary but more harmonious domicile, and get affairs in order. And time apart might be good for both of you...give you time to realize what is most important."
"Exactly. You are looking at the overall picture which is indeed smart. You have a lot of things that are just not bringing you much joy. But you seem to dig the current beau and even if the two of you haven't reached complete synchronicity, he seems to have things you consider significant."
"It‚Äôs really inappropriate for me to give lift advice on a life situation that i don‚Äôt fully understand, but what i can say is to keep your options open. Develop your skills and be ready to bolt at any time because you are worth so much. I am drunk and tired i will finish this comment wheni wake"
"Well then if neither of you are stable than kids is the last thing you need to be considering even if it‚Äôs years away. That shouldn‚Äôt even be in your mind until you are stable enough to support a kid. So you need to be thinking about him and you and how well you all work with each other and if that‚Äôs what you want, not wether or not he wants kids soon or not, because you shouldn‚Äôt be having kids soon. "
Thank you very much this makes me feel much more positive about this situation!!
Yes he does I love him to death! We have very little in common but theres just something about him we just click and get along so well! 
I am 100% financially independent. I have been for 3 years now since leaving college and living on my own. I got a roommate so I could save money to buy a house and I breed on the side for extra income. I dont make what I would want to in order to have a family but if It did happen accidentally I wouldn't be in any trouble. It does matter if he wants children or not and when because that is what I want in life at some point in time. You seem to have a very negative outlook so I'll end the conversation here but thank you anyways.
You're welcome.

"I didn't eat anything for 48 hours and whilst in the shower I almost fainted, I thought I was having a fucking heart attack. Shit scared the shit out of me."
"Well i haven't eaten anything today yet, i woke up around 3pm, and it's 9:30pm now.. i should go and eat something..."
"I can develop some severe tunnel vision and commitment if I get on a project I'm really into, usually working on my car.  I will reach a point at times where I forget to eat or drink.  Sometimes 10 or more hours if it's a long project.  I have been working on slowing my pace and taking breaks if it's taking a while or if I get frustrated with something."
"I've done this plenty of times. Sometimes I just don't feel hunger. 

The longest time I've ever went without eating was 2 and 1/2 days and every time I stood up my vision would go completely black and fall over, oops. I ate after that happened. "
"It's actually quite healthy for you to skip meals.  Our early ancestors did not have access to 3 square meals a day. 

View #fasting and #omad for more tips. "
"I have this huge problem where sometimes I skip lunch at work because i'm not paid by the hour, so the faster I go the faster I get out. And eating is like ""i'm going to be in my car eating for 20 minutes when I could use that 20 minutes to just hurry up and finish up already"". It's very physical work too, and I eat when I feel like i'm ready to collapse.

I've gotten better at it since though because it makes more sense to give yourself more energy than to drain it all half way through work and be tired all day even after eating.  

"
"I generally do that very often at anime cons.

I'll not eat all day since I usually cosplay shirtless characters, then at night when the parties start I get super drunk and wake up like ""wait did I eat yesterday?"" "
"I need to eat quite regularly, properly and at set times just to stay functioning. Skipping a meal is not really an option if I can help it, cause my blood sugar and energy levels plummet if I do and I'm essentially a zombie at that point. I don't have type 1 diabetes or anything like that, it's just how my body works currently. I often envy people who in comparision to me can survive on next to nothing."
"I haven't done this before, but I know that I most likely will at some stage. I've set up a routine for breakfast and dinner, but not lunch, so I often forget to have it."
"Fasting is actually really good for you, lots of research to back it up. I'm 18 hrs in right now (had coffee tho) and will probably break around 21. I do this at least once a week."
aw what a sweet bf u got :D
"Yes, but I have bipolar and it comes with the territory!"
Ah interesting. You learn something new everyday! 
"I don't eat much most days, and it isn't that uncommon for me to not feel hungry unless I work out or something. I don't work in a very physically demanding job, and I focus very intently sometimes to the point I just don't even notice. By the time I stop it's often far past the point it makes sense to eat, so I just ... don't?"
"Oh my 48 hours!? That's a lot, I'm not surprised you almost fainted but good job it was nothing more :o I wonder why it is we can forget to basic needs"
"48 hours, holy damn! When something similar happened to me just after Christmas it was only like a day without. Shit was still scary, though.

Took a hot bath for a while and when I was finished got up and started to feel wobbly. Sat on the edge of the tub at first and then on the toilet. Next thing I know, I wake up face down on the floor of my bathroom.

The day after I realized I could have split my head open if I didn't get out of the tub that quickly and that spooked me quite a bit."
Is it like a white static intro playing in your head? (just like when the tv is down)
yeah you probably should
"I can understand the forgetting when busy, I can do that too, but the fact that I was doing nothing is a bit worrying haha. "
"Yeah I wasn't feeling hungry but then once I'd been asked if I'd eaten I felt hungry. 
Glad I didn't get to that stage of falling over haha "
Ooo 
Ah at least you're working on being better and not completely depleting yourself. 
"I've heard tell of the 6.2.1 rule for larps and cons and festivals. 6 hours of sleep, 2 meals, and 1 shower each day. Preventative medicine, basically."
How come you don't eat because it's shirtless characters? I'd be more worried about spilling food on a costume over skin haha 
"To be honest I'm not really really specific with my eating times. Not because of anything physical like this, it's just a mental thing if certain meals are eaten between certain times and I don't like to deviate. "
I more often than not just skip breakfast because I don't get up early enough and I just wait it out till lunch
Yeah he's pretty great <3
Ooo I didn't realise that was something related 
I sometimes do that when it's too late so just don't bother 
"Well, I was fasting, so I knew that I hadn't eaten.

I was washing my body and just thinking about food and I started feeling weird, went to brush my teeth and had no energy to get the toothpaste out of tube, started feeling weirder, got out of the shower and everything started going dark, you know how you look into a light and it stays ingrained into your eyesight for a while? That happened from just looking into a mirror,felt  extremely dizzy, then I could feel my heart beating through my chest and plodded to the fridge and ate 3 pinches of shredded cheese and I felt normal again. 

"
"Is this a regular daily thing for you though? There are actual benefits to fasting IF you fast properly, which you may unintentionally be doing. 

Maybe you can use it to your advantage"
"I bloat easily, and I look like shit.  Lol I diet pretty hard when I go to anime conventions so I usually don't drink or eat anything until I'm done cosplaying for the day.

Like last con I went to, on top of my usual workouts, I rode my bicycle 2,000 miles in 5 weeks, (averages to like 57 a day?) to drop the last of my weight.

I didn't do all that to eat and be bloated "
Yep! It‚Äôs part of being hypomanic / fully manic. Decreased need for sleep  and food are some of the symptoms.
Oh man that sounds scary! 
Shredded cheese is the revival potion!!
"No it's not regular, just slipped my mind today. "
"Oh I didn't think about that. Shows my level of adulting when my concern is making a mess haha. 
That sounds like some real dedication to your art though!! "
Your comment reminded me of how I worked *so hard* to lose weight to look good in a bikini in Las Vegas but when I went there we ate at buffets and drank all day! My dieting was pointless. 
"I just have some really bad image issues, lol (I don't even shower w/ the lights on, lol)"
Oh no I'm sorry about that
I had to check my MIL's butt for a stuck piece of poo. 
Pretty average day for me. Family was getting on my nerves but sticking around for pizza made it all worth it. Should‚Äôve read but meh. Otherwise completely average/just chilling out.
"Pretty average here

I'm starting college in the fall so I don't have much to do this summer until my orientation which is almost 2 weeks away. I was mostly just chilling and watching Netflix but my family made me come with them to some family friend's baby shower + dinner which was kinda boring"
"My day's just started but yesterday was awesome. I went to a carnival with my family, went on rollercoasters and rides and all that. Fucking exhausted today but worth it.

I'm sorry your day sucked, here's hoping tomorrow is better ^^"
Sorry for laughing :D That just made the fact that I combed through my black carpet for poo a bit less annoying in hindsight.
When doesn't family get on our nerves? Had a phone call with my mum too. She still doesn't know shit about anything but is still very eager to talk about everything.
Oh man. I couldn't take that if I'm honest. I don't like crowds or my family and two of them together make me very uncomfortable. When I'm forced to go to family party I isolate myself somewhere in the house and play with their dogs or cats if they have any. I can't even get drunk because no one in my family likes alcohol and the parties are always 100% sober. I'm also the driver because I absolutely refuse to be a passenger in a car if my mum's behind the wheel. She loses her temper way too quickly when driving and when that happens she can't think and when that happens you shouldn't be driving.
"Your awesome day would be uncomfortable to me if I'm honest. I don't like my family, I don't like crowds but I used to like carnival rides until I lost my ability to keep my food in. I still like rollercoasters, especially if they make loops but I hate anything that just spins in place and does nothing else. Haunted houses are my absolute favourite. The cheesy and outright crappy scares are so funny I usually come out with my sides hurting. I like smaller carnivals because they attract less people and the lines aren't too long either."
"At least it was your own poo. And you didn't have to look at your MIL's butt.  So see, it could have been worse. "
"I hear ya. Can‚Äôt complain all together, I mean they treated to pizza so minor annoyances aside they were fine. "
"Huh, neat. To each their own I guess. I actually have never gone inside a haunted house before... Seems like they'd be pretty fun, though. I'd give it a try if I ever had the chance.

Yeah, smaller local/community carnivals are definitely less crowded."
But I bet you haven't managed to burn noodles to a crisp.
"I just hope the pizza toppings were for your liking. My family likes everything I dislike on pizza, such as tuna, mushrooms, pineapple and tomato slices. When I go out to get a pizza I usually get one of those fantasy pizzas where you can choose your own toppings and get as much meat on there as possible with blue cheese."
"It's funny how my taste in carnival rides did a complete 180 at some point. As a kid I didn't like haunted houses because they scared me and I once got a concussion from running into a wall when I got scared. I loved everything that spun however. I've always liked rollercoasters though, but even with them my taste changed. I used to like those where you sit upright in a car, but nowadays I prefer the ones where you're suspended from above in a lying position like [this] (http://www.ltcstudentweb.com/mahlikshana/Images/superman%20%20w.jpg)"
You've got me there.   Here's to a better day tomorrow for both of us!
"Really? Those are pretty cool. And, yeah, preferences change a lot as people grow."
"My dad once managed to burn potatoes when he was around my age. Just left the pot on the stove until they were black, crispy and tiny. He peeled the burnt parts off and ate the potatoes with his girlfriend. They weren't very good apparently.

I really hope tomorrow will be better for both of us."
I just don't understand why I started throwing up so easily. Ruined a lot of rides for me.
"Aww. That sucks, I'm sorry :/"
I‚Äôm in the same situation. I work for the largest steel producer in the world. Benefits are amazing Pay is great all the OT I want. I just hate factories I‚Äôve worked in smaller ones in the past and I knew I‚Äôd hate it when I took the job. I took it cause it was double the pay over triple if I‚Äôm willing to work OT. I went to school to be a lineman for utility companies. They don‚Äôt hire often unless I willing to travel. Good news is tho my local utility is hiring and I‚Äôm praying to god I get the call.
"Not me. I have an insanely smart friend. He's a naturally gifted speaker, loves learning, retains information incredibly well, and can find logical links quickly. We might be discussing a book by Charles Dickens and he can find all sorts of references to theology, English history and politics at the time, Greek mythology, etc., even if they involve symbolic meanings that aren't even easy to spot. He often bests my teacher.


Anyways, his dad is a pretty successful lawyer and hates his job. Even told him, ""you know, you can quit school whenever you want. You're over 16. It's legal now."" I just mentioned the whole previous anecdote to show how his dad hates his job so much that he wouldn't mind his smart son quitting school."
"Good luck! Being a linesman is actually pretty similar to what I do. I sometimes come across them in my work. My local ones have mandatory on-call/overtime and such too and get a bit grumpy when you call them out at night, but otherwise they seem to like it."
Quite surprised to hear his dad even mentioned quitting school as an option. I do feel sorry for someone who hates his job that much and sticks with it though.
It sounds great to me I‚Äôve wanted to do it since I graduated high school. 
"It's really weird, too. Mom is a doctor and he told me they could very, very easily live off of the dad not working. He asked his dad why he doesn't just quit, but the dad doesn't know. Maybe he needs something to do? Maybe quitting is a big life decision? I don't know. If it makes you feel better, his dad loves being part of his education. He's in debate and his dad helps assess his arguments and chaperones tournaments.


I don't want to reveal my friend's identity or anything but he has won several prizes and it's always great to see his dad there. He always seems happy. "
"I think this poor guy need to keep his job but find some very satisfying side activity.   Volunteering, doing pro bono work or what ever would bring him joy.    "
"Did you tell them you were taking a break? It's possible that they felt you were a close friend and stopped talking to them out of no where. They might be feeling similar to how you are?  
  
If not some people can be arrogant but what you describe seems more than most people are. I hope you the best
"
"Thanks. I believe that could be true. Last year I was gone without a trace, and many people thought I blocked them. It‚Äôs a bit late to explain my case, but the only discomfort I have with people now is their lack of interest and sympathy to others. This is something I see with people I haven‚Äôt met either."
"Imagine you have a friend and they ghosted you for year without a word then they just try to reconnect out of no where?  
That's probably how they feel. If you tell them you decided to take a break it will make them feel better and understand."
Congratulations.  Best wishes to you both
"That's an odd living arangment, but whatever works for you guys. Congrats. How big is it?"
"So exciting, congrats!"
"Jesus from an apartment to a 3 bedroom house ? Congrats, bro !"
Yeah bro good on you for doing something so bold and out of your comfort zone in the first place 
"Aww, gratz!"
Congratz bro! 
Congrats! are you excited ?
Yeah dude you just gotta have trust in yourself and your decisions and it should all end up fine 
"Living with a best friend, what a dream. "
Thank you!
"It‚Äôs pretty small, but we all lived in the same apartment complex before, so it‚Äôs quite an upgrade over the previous situation. And my fianc√© and I didn‚Äôt have the financial resources to move into a house this year, so we settled on bringing in a roommate, and decided on one of my closest friends because he is very clean, and wouldn‚Äôt overall be obnoxious to live with. Currently, we are both about to get significant raises at our respective jobs, so our plan is to be financially stable at the end of our lease to move into a house with just me and my fianc√©!"
"Thank you! I‚Äôm having to control all of my anxiety though! It‚Äôs such a big change for me. I grew up living in an apartment. I have no idea what I‚Äôm going to do with a backyard, but the possibilities are going to be endless!!"
"Like I said above,It‚Äôs pretty small, but we all lived in the same apartment complex before, so it‚Äôs quite an upgrade over the previous situation. And my fianc√© and I didn‚Äôt have the financial resources to move into a house this year, so we settled on bringing in a roommate, and decided on one of my closest friends because he is very clean, and wouldn‚Äôt overall be obnoxious to live with. Currently, we are both about to get significant raises at our respective jobs, so our plan is to be financially stable at the end of our lease to move into a house with just me and my fianc√©! But we are very excited nonetheless! We couldn‚Äôt do it without a roommate, but one roommate is better than a ton of roommates!
And what‚Äôs crazy is between all 3 of us, overall it is costing us less than living in the apartments!"
I appreciate it! We‚Äôre so excited!
"Thank you! I‚Äôm ready to finally have the space, and only share it with people we want to! I‚Äôm so tired of having to be involved in other people‚Äôs business!!"
"I‚Äôm very excited, but dealing with a lot of anxiety. This will be the most money I‚Äôve put down on anything, and I‚Äôm stressing over almost all of the little things. Like tonight I planned on getting my truck and trailer in anticipation of having it for Monday, however something has come up with work so that I can‚Äôt get it until tomorrow (which I know is still plenty of time) and for some reason I‚Äôm making that into a bigger deal than it is. So it‚Äôs a good thing, but I‚Äôm ready for it to pass so I can not worry about it. "
"Yeah, the woes of being a worry wart everything will be fine, and I‚Äôll be happy to have it done!"
"The idea of renting houses is still new to me, but that makes more sense. 3 Bedrooms still seems kinda overkill, but whatever works for you. "
I feel you. I'm moving into my first detached home at the end of the month. We have a small dog that's used to apartment life and I'm so excited to have a yard for him to run around in.
Wow thats amazing hope you guys have a great time :) 
"I mean, you have to have a man cave"
"We didn‚Äôt want to rent, but didn‚Äôt really have the time frame to secure a loan, and find a home we didn‚Äôt have to ‚Äúsettle‚Äù for. I‚Äôd rather settle on a rent house for a year that doesn‚Äôt have everything I wanted, and search for a home that is exactly how I want"
My pupper is gonna love it. She loves going to grandmas because there is so much yard and other dogs to play! 
"I‚Äôm just excited for the man cave. One thing I never realized when I was young. I always thought the man cave was a room that the man chose to have to himself, and that it was selfish.but as I near getting married, I realize that I have no choice but have a man cave, because she doesn‚Äôt want all of my nerd shit laying around the house!"
Man Cave --> Office --> Nursery --> Baby's Room
Precisely 
"The man cave is gonna double as an office, with all of the computer stuff in there. And we don‚Äôt have any plans to be pregnant within the next year or so, but if we were there is an option. "
"RIP Man cave. 

Also, ever notice how grammatically awful the phrase ""We're Pregnant"" is?"
"I‚Äôve noticed it, and choose to ignore it. I think it‚Äôs a beautiful thing between people that love each other!"
Indeed it is. 
I agree and now I realized that this post is pretty much useless 
"It is possible, but you'll have to do your research first. Obviously, you will also need money to set it up. You'll need materials to build your farm or whatever, animals, seeds, etc. And solar panels if you want electricity at all. It is also possible that you will be confronted with unforeseen problems (like animals getting a disease, losing your crops, etc.) that will make you get back to civilization for supplies. And that's no longer living off the grid. :P "
"This is my (totally impractical) dream. Find an isolated patch of woods and set up camp... Never mind I have no survival skills whatsoever. I read *Walden* not too long ago and it just made me want to do it more. Although Thoreau was still going back to civilization pretty regularly.

In reality, I think it would take a whole lot of dedication, preparation, experience, and knowledge to actually carry through with something like this and to have it work for the rest of one's life. I think it's possible, but not accessible to most people. I think the really tough part would be finding a piece of land where nobody would find or look for you."
"It's a nice idea, but in this day and age, it would be incredibly tough. You'd be pretty screwed without a bank account, electricity and an internet connection."
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off_the_Grid:_Million_Dollar_Manhunt
"It's not useless. Being completely self-sufficient is the ultimate dream, but we kind of have to rely on other people, nowadays."
"Oh, and you could also get sick and die, lol. "
I mean the Amish seem to be doing fine
Never heard of this show before I'll check it out thx 
"Are they properly off the grid, though?"
"Yeah, met a community up in Ohio who held good farmers markets (They could sell pretty cheap due to their own grown food and little other expenses) and drove proper horse and wagons on the roads.

But yeah, most groups are. Not sure you‚Äôd need to go that extreme, but they make do "
"When you get supplies, whatever they might be (toilet paper or toothpaste for example) you're not living off the grid. Just saying. "
"That's kind of what I was saying. They like the idea of being off the grid, but still rely on other people to get by. It's the world that we live in."
"They do. 

But none afforded for me, so Thanos snap awaits them /s LOL "
"Personally, I think people generally can change and so a shot at another chance should always be open. It will just be a matter of choice for the other person if he/she is willing to give that person another chance. Just always remember that people can learn from their mistakes and doing something bad in the past doesn‚Äôt necessarily equate that you‚Äôd be repeating the same thing. I know people are also a creature of habit so I know where the hesitance might come from but there are always two sides of a coin. So yeah, what I‚Äôm saying is just to keep an open mind. "
"Depends on the person and what they did. Some absolutely deserve a second change, but some people manage to waste all of their changes at once if they do something particularly bad such as steal my favourite t-shirt, rip holes in it and throw it in a pile of dog vomit. Fuck you Jarkko, you fucking prick. Fuck you."
Only if you feel they are truly sorry and want to put actual effort into making up for it.
Thanos should have held trials lol
"Keep an open mind that's good advice, thanks. I'm just worried some people truly want to change but can't help themselves"
"That's pretty messed up, why would any sane person do that?"
LOL
"Agreed, it‚Äôs a tough call too at times. "
I know :( It was an Arch Enemy shirt too...
You got him to pay you back right?
I filled his shoes with water and decided to call it even.
"All the time. I really don't like just being around random people while I eat. I know I'm a messy eater, for one, and I don't want people judging me. Also, I just like peace and quiet. Other people's noises are very mentally distracting and I also don't want to be engaged in small talk or conversation."
"I travel for work several times a month and I so enjoy the rare solitude of the trips to and from (all in-state travel, so 3 hours or less). I always eat in my car so I don't have to look or feel awkward or conspicuous sitting alone in a fast food restaurant. I mean, their ambiance isn't ever the best, and they're also usually too cold for me. Unless I have to use the restroom, I'd just rather grab, eat quick in my car, check my phone, play a game, etc. and then be on my way in peace. "
All the time!  Wendy‚Äôs is my fave but their dining areas are always disgusting.
I did exactly this at midnight last night. Nothing beats sitting in your own personal restaurant.
"Are you fucking kidding me? Why would I go sit in some shitty ass, hard-seat ass booth with sticky ass tables surrounded either slightly frustrated construction workers, stressed out moms, and old people circling words on the newspaper when I could sit in my comfy car seat and listen to dank podcasts while I eat?"
"There's a small park near my work with a small parking lot. Loads of trees all around. And no one knows about it, so it's always empty. I'll grab lunch and take it there most days (drive through or brought from home)."
I love listening to music in my car or watching a video while I eat. I could put headphones on and eat inside the place but there's a sort of privacy in your own car that I really like. It seems like there's always someone else eating in their car or finishing up when I park lol
"Oh yeah... all the time. It‚Äôs 105+ all the time, I‚Äôm not getting out a The fuckin car."
"Seriously, this is one of the few reasons I regret not learning to drive. I wish I could do this, just for a few minutes of peace and quiet and an uninterrupted meal"
I do it for lunch almost everyday. It‚Äôs my get away. If I go to my office I guarantee I‚Äôll be interrupted. 
"Its the ONLY way I eat fast food. I cant even remember the last time i was inside a fast food place.

My car is comfy, I control the interior temperature, what music/podcast/youtube video I watch/listen to and I control the volume.

Its fantastic. I ESPECIALLY love it when it is raining or snowing and you can appreciate the beauty of precipitation without getting caught up in it.

I'm pretty sure my local Taco Bell knows me as the guy that rolls up stoned as fuck, orders food for 2 people, and then proceeds to devour it all in the parking lot. "
"I do that a lot, nothing really weird about it. Funny enough, one of the suburbs near where I grew up had an ordinance against eating food in parked cars because their McDonald's parking lot would get too crowded back in the day. Nowadays, if it's still on the books, it doesn't seem to be enforced."
"Not me, I feel more comfortable eating on a table. "
My mom and I did that when I was a kid at White Castle. We'd park and watch the cars go by. Still do it even though I'm nearly 30 now when I visit. 
"Wow, sincerely, I just had this idea like five minutes ago, wild.


Picture this- a Park Park. (The name might need some work, lol)

 
A nice little scenic spot with a pond, or maybe a mural or sculpture, and some parking spaces. Somewhere people can drive up and sit, look at something pleasant while they eat or space out or cool down or meditate or whatever. "
I didnt realise there was any other way to do it. 
"Frequently get a frosty or ice cream and listen to my audio book in the car while I eat it, damn proud of it."
I would if the patrons and restaurant permit smoking 
yup! I even bought [a little shelf](https://www.etsy.com/listing/241001650/oak-steering-wheel-ipad-iphone?ga_order=most_relevant&ga_search_type=all&ga_view_type=gallery&ga_search_query=steering%20wheel%20desk&ref=sr_gallery-1-4) that hooks to my steering wheel to eat on. I requested they leave off the cup holder since my car has one.
"It's perfect- no people, controlled temperature, and I can listen to my music or podcast while I eat. "
I'm just lazy and don't want to get out. Plus I can listen to my music in the car. 
"I fucking hate the loud ass music in restaurants, especially fast food, places now!

Like, I don‚Äôt wanna feel like I‚Äôm at a nightclub while Im stuffing my face with a 1500 calorie double bacon cheeseburger. "
Total 80‚Äôs dad move.
Zen
Almost every time. If I'm getting something at a drive through it's because I'm just not up for a lot of human interaction in the first place. It's relaxing just listening to music or streaming Netflix while I chow down. 
"I always need to watch TV whenever I eat, (good or bad habit, you decide) but i‚Äôll go as far as to grab food through the drive through, park, pull up a show on my phone, and sit there watching. I feel like going into the restaurant and watching something just isn‚Äôt the same because of all the factors you listed. "
"I go through the Schlotzky‚Äôs drive-thru and get a cheese pizza and a Diet Coke, then drive across the road and park behind the trees in the empty back parking lot of the Liquor Barn and watch YouTube and eat...as a treat to myself. I love when I get to do it. It‚Äôs stupid, but relaxing and nice. "
I thought everyone did this. I've been doing it since I could drive!
"I love the feeling of going drive through, ordered my food and the drive around at night to find a perfect spot to eat and chill with buddies while listen to our favourite jam. Sometimes is better than eat - in or do it at home."
You are definitely getting judged.
Whenever I go to a McDonald‚Äôs it‚Äôs late at night and always quiet 
Guilty as charged.
Yeah. It‚Äôs more comfortable to eat alone. 
For sure. Also I can listen to my podcast or music and whatever. It‚Äôs the best. 
Literally did just that about an hour ago. Listen to some music or comedy and it's a nice relaxing meal with no other humans around
I've seen people do this a lot! Won't the car go smelly if you do this?
Pretty much always if I‚Äôm by myself. I can read my Kindle in peace.
Havent eaten fast food in 15 years but I used to all the time.  They don't let you smoke anything in the restaurant!
Almost every day on my lunch break! There‚Äôs a Wendy‚Äôs right in the parking lot of where I work and I usually just go through the drive through and sit in my car watching a youtube video or listening to music. Way better than bringing it back to the break room to have awkward conversation with someone I work with.
Almost all of the time I'm eating fast food it's in town /city centres. I just walk to get food so I either carry it to work or home and eat it there or if I'm out and in my local ill eat it in the pub. If its nice outside I might eat it outside but I spend almost no time anywhere where there's a drive thru unless I'm with people in which case it's nicer to eat inside so I'm not talking to the back of a car seat
All the time I do that. It's the best especially with a freind. Even alone :)
"My wife and I call this ""park and munch"", a term I imported from my stoner days. Back then, there was no waiting to eat. Once the food is present, it is devoured."
"Don't forget the TVs locked on HGTV or Food Network yet are muted anyway. No, we don't know where the remote is. There probably never was a remote.

I'm a fan of going in the parking lot and having a picnic on the rear of my car."
"I thought I was the only one.
There are dozens of us!"
Constantly- I prefer to listen to the radio and may have a phone call. 
"I did the same, since I don't want to be that guy who seat alone on a big table and cause other to not have places to eat."
I'm more likely to eat in my car than to go inside and eat.
"Why not? 

Eating in the car is an underrated pleasure. As long as you take care and clean up"
I feel worse eating fast food inside usually. If you can get the smell out of your car all is worth it. 
"I do this all the time, mainly at Chick-fil-A. I only ever get a sandwich so it feels ridiculous to park, walk in, and take up a whole table just to eat one small sandwich lol"
Reading this made me feel so much better about eating lunch in my car every day. I need the mental break from work and my car feels like the only place I can eat in peace/decompress for 30 minutes!
"If there‚Äôs no reason that I‚Äôm required to go inside of a fast food restaurant- (getting food with a friend who insists we go inside) then I will happily go through the drive thru and chow down in my car. 

Fuck all those random ass people and their loud conversations. I don‚Äôt wanna be around them. 
The drivers seat is far more comfy than any seating at a Wendy‚Äôs or whathaveyou, there is exactly ZERO reason for me to be inside. 

We would get along. "
Just did this today! I do it all the time. 
"All the time! My dogs can't go in, so I stay out too."
Yes
"You're fine. It's like, i wanna sit and eat, bit I wanna smoke and listen to *my* music while I do it too, ya know?"
"I do this when I'm on the road (I travel long distances by car several times a year.)

It's easier, I don't have to deal with people or be around them at all, I can eat in peace and quiet (or with my own music or whatever playing), the car is infinitely more comfortable, and I can hit the road again literally 30 seconds after I'm done.  Plus, I don't really like leaving my vehicle unattended for very long in unfamiliar places (other than hotel parking lots) or sketchy areas.

I'm really, really anti-social though...and when I'm on these trips, I prefer to stay in my own world/bubble. (On top of all of the aforementioned reasons.)"
"All the time, dude. All the time."
If I get an ice cream I do. Otherwise it melts.
"I rarely go to fast food restaurants, but when I do I typically use the drive through or get a to-go order.  Then I'll drive to a park in the area, a place with a view and benches, etc., to eat.  I avoid the fast food din, also avoid eating in the car, usually get a little air, and if I'm in a park and have time I'll walk around to burn a few of the calories.  "
"In most of those places, the tables are nasty.  I'll go find an outside bench or just eat in my car. "
"All the time.  My job means Im constantly in my car.  I go though the drive though, park, and enjoy some AC and my podcast while I eat."
Super often. Like I know I'm weird for doing it. But it feels so much better than being  surrounded by people. Fuck people 
From time to time. The music in my car is always better.
"Since I don't have A/C in the car, I go through the drive through and drive my happy ass back home and eat in silence, all whilst trying not to die of heat stroke. "
I'll eat my burger at red lights & munch on fries while I'm driving. The milkshake I'll drink as necessary. So far I can finish my meal before I get home. Like a 10-15 minute drive 
"I literally just ordered a small pizza from Domino's and am sitting in the parking lot waiting to go get it and come back to my car.

I would have ordered in person but I had to go online for the 50% off."
"A lot, I don‚Äôt wanna get out. "
"Thankfully I live near water, I love going for lunches and parking near the lake to watch boats and the waves in general. Waters calming for me I feel."
"Absolutely! There's this little sushi place near my house. Sometimes I go buy a double salmon roll and drive to a little park not far away. It's got a small artificial lake and I park my car facing it, roll down the windows, lean my seat back and eat while watching the geese and ducks swim in circles in the water. It's meditative. "
Literally every time I go for fast food.... which is too often lol. 
"Yep, I love it.

Sometimes I will eat as a drive, othertimes I will just go throught drivethrough and wait until I get home / back to work.

Fast food restaurants are not very nice places in eat in. Messy, never clean, and not always the best customers to eat around."
"I hate going into restaurants for social reasons. Talking to someone through a box is definitely easier then talking to someone face to face. Also it‚Äôs pretty awkward to eat in front of people. If the place has a kids area, it always smells like feet and that‚Äôs just incredibly disgusting to smell when I‚Äôm just trying to eat my burger as well as the screaming kids can get very loud. Parking is easier just because it‚Äôs hard and dangerous (that‚Äôs what she said) to eat food while you‚Äôre driving, and by the time you get home your food is probably cold."
I do it all the time when I order fast food haha. You're not alone.
"I do this all the time as well! Mostly for drinks and ice cream. It's just so comfy in the car, usually faster, too."
I do this from time to time before work. Maybe once a week or everyother week. I just enjoy the radio with the windows rolled up and the ac cranking. yeah good times.
"Drive thru is sometimes faster than ordering at the counter or, even worse, using those self-order machines at McDonald's. I also ate a lot in my car when I was on maternity leaves or had kids with me: it saved me from unbuckling kids from their seat, get the double-stroller, buckling them in, ram the door with the stroller, order, redo everything in reverse while holding my coffee. "
"yea, i might even like to get out of my car and sit an nearby table sometimes, i still feel judged for it, even if no one is around"
"OMG I do this all the time!!!  I have 3 kids so it‚Äôs easier for me to get some chick fil a In the drive thru, pull up to a shady parking spot, let them out of their car seats and have a picnic in mommy‚Äôs car and keep the DVD going!  I do it when I‚Äôm by myself too as well!  I have no shame!  It‚Äôs what I like!"
If I do this I go to a park or someplace with a nice view.
Just did it. I feel the same way
"Im general, being in your own car alone when you're not driving is always pleasent for me."
"Bright lights, noise, human interaction...nah, no thanks. The only thing it has going for it, is the bathroom."
"trust me, you aren't being judged for that lol. tons of people do it, it's nice to just sit there kinda doing your own thing without tons of little kids screaming, people yelling that they're order's messed up, and all that other crazy stuff. I do the same thing sometimes, lol I feel you bro"
"Of course! One time my mom and I parked to eat our meal and I realized that we were surrounded by people all doing the same thing. Some were listening to their own music, most looked like they were eating in silence, It was like a convention of introverts."
Used to but now my car is so nice I don't want to fuck up the seats. First world problem.
"I always do this, I figured it was normal. In the car i can listen to my music/podcasts and eat in an environment I‚Äôm in control of. When i was a kid we always took fast food home to eat rather than eat there, eating should always be in a comfy spot."
Holy fuck I was about to do this the other day but it was too hard to turn around and park. I had no idea there were other people who did this
"I went on a solo vacation recently and so much of my time was spent hanging out in my car alone. Breakfast, killing time, didn't want to head back to my hotel, waiting for my scheduled event to start, talking on the phone and not ready to head inside, traveling, etc. Spent so much time just hanging out in my rental car."
I never realized I did this until reading your post and thinking ‚Äúgod that sounds familiar‚Äù
"I literally just did this tonight, got carryout from Put back steakhouse, drove across the street and ate my dinner in the empty parking lot lmao. A little bit later some guy pulled up a few spots down and I assume he was eating as well since he had the lights on and was in there for ahwile before going into the nearby building. "
My boyfriend and I do this all the time! (:
"i do this all the time, i finish work and drive to a local food joint. Grab some food and just pull over and eat. i watch some clips on Youtube eat up Sometimes i just need a break from going straight from Work to home . Sitting in a car park my brain switches off sometimes i'll watch cars go by and have imaginary conversations it sounds crazy i know but it just lets my brain go from 100% to 0% "
"I thought that was normal lol we do it all the time. I never thought about being judged or any particular reason just get the food, eat, get out to throw away the trash, get back in the car and leave"
Think about going to a park and having a private little picnic. I do that often. It's great!
My colleague used to go to KFC a lot and when it was busy inside he would take the (almost always empty) drive through then go sit indoors...
"Where I'm from it's a common thing amongst teenagers who have recently passed to go to a drive through with friends and then park in the car park to eat.

About a week after passing I took my mates through McDonald's drive through and they all did the same with me. "
I do it all the time when I‚Äôm working! I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs weird at all! 
Every time! 
I do! Tinted windows help 
Gotta keep the podcasts going while I eat. It's not like you're going to make a new lifelong friend at Burger King. 
"I used to do that, usually when I was in a rush, but not enough of a rush to have to eat while I'm driving. Felt a little weird, but whatever."
I love doing this when I got stuff to say to my friends. We all eat in the car. Then it smells food for 1 week.  
I never eat in fast food places. I do ot a lot when I'm  by myself/traveling. However I have done it close to home cause I was starving. I'd be the car with the seagulls around it because it's funny to see them go nuts. 
"Only time I get to listen to my podcasts. My car is comfy and reminds me to clean out my car, I‚Äôll look around and throw other trash in bag then do a circle to toss the bag. It‚Äôs great!

Drive ins were popular for a reason "
"Have people never heard of a drive-inn? Look up The Chick-Inn in Ypsilanti, Michigan. They had girls in roller skates bring  you your food, like sonic before sonic. They're still around, since the 50's I think. You eat where you order or drive away. No shame in being a lil piggie, oink oink."
"Whenever I go out, I normally order take out since I don‚Äôt go to fast food places, and we eat in a parking lot. Normally it‚Äôs a Lowe‚Äôs that‚Äôs nearby. It‚Äôs become like a tradition. 
"
"Of course, privacy, adjustable temperature controls and the ability to control your entertainment.  Plus a seat that reclines when you regret your food choices and need a bloated moment or two.  What's not to like?"
"That's my favorite thing to do. 2 days ago I went to Burger King after work (it was about 1 am), ordered me some food and ate in the car, in the parking lot. There were a few cars around that did the same. I turned on the radio and lurked on Reddit while I ate. It was marvellous. "
"Pretty much the only way I do it. Most fast food joint seating areas aren't designed for 6'7"" 300+ lbs. Besides, my music is always on in my van."
I do this with my kids haha I thought I just did it because that's what my dad used to do with my siblings and I! 
I drive a company owned van and most of of the the time my lunch break is in the driver's seat. Even if I go inside to order I go back out to the van to sit and eat. It's just more comfortable to be in my own space. 
"You know, I have. Kind of like Sonic, you kind of just order then sit alone in the quiet without all the noise of life. Sometimes we just need that. Because life can be exhausting with all its demands. I particularly would pick a certain corner in one of the bigger parking lots, too. Just off in the distance. Let my eyes close and chew, haha."
"Pretty much every single time. I get my own music, sit back comfortably, and I can leave literally as soon as im done eating."
"All the time. It‚Äôs quite peaceful and I truly get my own alone time. Heck I don‚Äôt even have to go through a drive thru to do this. I‚Äôll heat up lunch in the break room or bring a sandwich and just grab my food and go out to my car. If I have room I‚Äôll move the car further away from my place of employment, otherwise I just crack the windows open, push the seat back and eat my food watching nature or reading something on my phone. "
Eating in a parking lot is an underrated emotion. It instills a cosmic sense of peace and tranquility in me. 
"Of course mate! It's actually really common here in the UK anyway. Sometimes the inside is just too full, sometimes you just want a quick drive by, but most of the time it is simply more comforting.

  


You have your music on, maybe watching some footy highlights, its warm since you never turned the engine off... you aren't disturbing anyone else and nobody is disturbing you. It's incredibly peaceful, like a private booth.

  


Also sometimes when you fancy a cheeky drive thru you don't bother dressing or looking decent ;)"
"I used to go to a grocery store, buy food, then sit in my car to eat it. I liked taking a few minutes to myself, away from society. Don‚Äôt have to listen to noisy people at a restaurant, I can blast my music in the car, and honestly I just like sitting in the car sometimes. "
"Dude me too. I like my air conditioning, my space, and my music. "
"My favorite thing to do. I have an addiction to taco bell, so I'll run through the drive through, park, and eat. 

It's amazing. I can continue to listen to whatever I want, while happily devouring my food. I just wish I could make those times last longer. "
All the time. I want to listen to the radio in peace and solitude. Then take a 10 minute catnap before I go back to work. 
Last time I did that someone attacked me saying that I should be giving those car spots to people who needed it instead of hogging one all by myself. The entire parking lot was practically empty. I stopped doing it from that moment. 
"Nah, never and will never. Kind of a germaphobe. Don't want to get the smell in car or have an accident. Plus the food and/or bags can get oily/greasy or whatever. Crumbs, etc. Doesn't matter how many napkins, wet wipes, or hand sanitizers I have. Don't like eating in cars or places other than the kitchen or a restaurant. "
All the time. Me and my GF would buy something at ChickFilA's drive-thru and then just eat food in the car whilst talking about random shit you shouldn't say in an all-Christian establishment.
"Yes, doing it right now"
"I don't like being around a bunch of strangers (somewhat introverted), but I also don't like the trouble and danger of eating while I drive, so fuck it, I'm gonna sit in the parking lot and eat."
"I refuse to go through drive thrus. If it takes forever, or I suddenly have somewhere I have to be and I'm in the drive thru, I'm stuck until it's my turn. If I am inside, i can easily get out of line. "
"I do it, but I don't like it. Would much prefer a table. 

Probably because the only time I'm doing that is when I'm in a rush and need some food. "
r/doesanyoneelse
"I do this at mcdonalds almost every morning... but I'm one of those weirdos that believes drive thru's should only be used for ordering drinks... I get furious thinking about people ordering meals for multiple people in a drive thru. So I GO INSIDE, and order, then leave and eat the food in my car."
Same. I‚Äôm always nervous when I eat in a public place. I‚Äôm not a super messy eater. But I am still somewhat of a slob 
This plus I want to be able to listen to my music through awesome speakers (or at least better than headphones) in peace. 
"Unless your being messy & obnoxious, no one will look/judge you. I'm not sure if its the main reason you don't go in or not. But if it is, I challenge you to go in, it wont be as bad as you think, most people just keep to themselves anyway, maybe you'll even start to enjoy yourself."
Yeah I feel the same way. Maybe pop in to use the can but my car is just more peaceful 
"Same!  I'm usually listening to a podcast or audiobook in the car anyway.

I don't want to pause The Adventure Zone while I chow down on a chicken sammich!"
"Did you ever get judged sitting and eating your food in your car? Once, I was eating in my car and a few dudes pointed and me and sort of smirked/chuckled to each other..."
A kindred soul!!
You should see their kitchen!  Oops 0_o 
"That's funny! I was actually about to reply with, ""Only at Wendy's, because the tables are oddly sticky."" That's really the only fast food place I sit inside for, though. "
"Yeah a lot of the Wendy's near me are old and haven't been renovated in decades, so they're just depressing as fuck to eat in, especially if you're alone. Parking lot all the way."
Exactly. It‚Äôs just sometimes scary to be alone in the dark in your car
Exactly 
I will always think of it like this from now on.
"> old people circling words on the newspaper

AHAHAHAHAHA that made me IRL LOL.

HAAAHAHAHA I love it because it implies that they're doing word search... not crosswords, or sudoku... too dumb for that. Fucking word search. Oh man, I'm sorry but i'm actually LOLing at this thought."
EGG ZACHARY 
"You forgot to say ""ass"""
I had a cop come up to my window while I was listening to music and eating my nuggets in my car at a park. Apparently the park closed at 10 and I should leave as soon as I finish my dinner. I think he felt sorry for me lol. I was just enjoying the view of the duck pond.
I listen to complete concerts so for sure I want to sit in my comfortable car instead of some yacht rock piped in.
"Me, too!"
for some reason this really made me laugh lmao
Yup
Not learning to drive is not really an option where I live. No real means of public transportation unless your in the cities 
Yeah it‚Äôs that last part that always makes me feel judged. Like they saw me in line. They saw me order my drive through. And then they seek me just turn and park in the parking lot 
Hey you do you man 
You mean like a park?
Oh that‚Äôs super cool. But off $10 shipping 
Same
"The only time I liked the music they play in the restaurants is the old songs (like 50s or 60s rock & roll/pop) they play in my local KFC and Steak & Shake, it doesn't feel like nightclub just an an old diner with a jukebox.
"
Very 
All the McDonald‚Äôs around here only have the drive through open late at might 
Right! 
Star Trek or Star Wars? Coke or Pepsi? Pepperoni or sausage!
Oof. Yeah having no heat/ac definitely makes doing that suck more
I dunno if I could count talking to the employee that takes your drive through order socialization. But yeah totally 
The only thing I worry about is spilling on me. A lot easier to do in the car. Especially if you go to like Dairy Queen and get a chili dog and a blizzard 
Self order machines? That just gives my soylent green and those gray hoop burgers from that one spongebob vibes 
Oh yeah. I have that problem too. Like I go to class early in the morning and sometimes I just sit there in my car at the campus parking lot until I‚Äôm like ‚Äúfuck I sat here too long I need to get to class!‚Äù 
lol. A convention of introverts would be the most awesomely boring thing ever. 
Well there‚Äôs your solution. Get a crappy car. I got one. Wanna trade? 
Rental cars are probably the best. Way nicer then what you drive normally and you don‚Äôt even have to pay for cleaning 
Put back steakhouse? What‚Äôs that like. You buy it then you have to put it back? Lol :p
Well given that it‚Äôs rainy here today I don‚Äôt think that would‚Äôve turned out well lol. I‚Äôll keep it in mind though!
I know of drive ins. But like you said. They aren‚Äôt very common any more. We used to have one here in the Cities when I was a kid. Don‚Äôt remember if we do anymore 
"There still are some such places out there, just not as many as there used to be. Dog 'n Suds still operates in Grayslake, IL and also Fox Lake (Ingleside part of Fox Lake btw), as per what I remember. There are at least 2 in Kenosha(The Spot and also Big Star). And of course, Superdawg still operates in Chicago and Wheeling, IL."
Totally 
Yeah. It‚Äôs kinda weird. It‚Äôs like your own little bubble of peace. The feeling is just doubled when it‚Äôs raining 
Are you me? That‚Äôs exactly what I did when I posted this. Went and grabbed some taco crack parked and ate my deliciousness 
Even without the radio. Just chilling. Looking at nothing relaxing. I dunno. It‚Äôs just peaceful. Way more then just hanging out at home in the basement. Idk why 
Well obviously they are just a cunt. While I was doing it there was a truck (semi though) taking up like 5 spots 
Fair. I don‚Äôt mind a bit of a mess so I can see how that differs. Well enjoy your eating wherever it may be 
I'm lazy.
"I eat a lot of stuff like asian soups that you can't really help but splatter, so I get shit everywhere all the time. But I just don't like being watched while I eat."
"> But I am still somewhat of a slob

We know, you eat fast food in your car by yourself. 

(I‚Äôm just joking with you by the way.)
"
"***S A M E***

First off I eat regular food like a pig unless I'm invited to dinner or something. Second, I spill blood like some kind of slaughterhouse worker. I have towels in my dining room and parlor designated *just* for blood. "
Is your car full of wrappers and fast food trash?
That's why I have a poop jar
I sat in a Culver‚Äôs parking lot today and listened to Murder on the Rockport Limited!
Not that I ever noticed.
"I love Wendy‚Äôs food, but the kitchen makes me want to die every time."
Oh no!  :(
Glad I could awaken the snoozing BIRD
Oh man that happened to me and a friend too. Except the cop wasnt very nice and since my friend was kind of a smart ass back then we ended up being detained lol
"I got into an incredibly stupid argument with someone on fatlogic who claimed driving everywhere is why Americans are fat. There's no public transport anywhere but a city, even if there is it has weird hours. 

Like where I live there's a bus, but it doesn't go everywhere. My house is 5 miles to the nearest stop but it's a winding country road with no sidewalks and a mountain on one side and creek on the other. Not safe to walk or ride a bike. 

Bus doesn't run on weekends and last bus on weekday is I think 9 or 10pm. You have to drive. "
"I live in a fairly small town, everywhere I need to go can be reached by walking fairly easily, and if it‚Äôs a bit far there is usually a bus ( though a taxi is often cheaper) so I guess I‚Äôm lucky. "
"Honestly, its kind of a good thing. They ALWAYS hook it up with the sauce when I roll up to the window to pay.

I guess it also helps that I'm as nice as possible to them and have made the employee taking my order laugh on occasion. "
"Way smaller scale. 

Glorified scenic parking lot basically "
"Yes, I know. But it's not the maker's fault. Shipping is just dang expensive in general! I think he just pops it in a priority mail box, IIRC. I've been amazed at how much it costs to ship a small box from NV to TN. It can cost more than the item inside. When I buy a gift locally to send elsewhere, I just consider the out-of-pocket cost to be double. "
Awh man. I live in a poor area so McDonald‚Äôs is like your dining room. 
"Oh god. 

I enjoy none of those things. 

I take it back. 

We have one commonality, and that‚Äôs avoiding people in fast food restaurants. 

I wish you the best. "
I really would if I wasn't so in love with the modern tech features.
"I suppose I should've said I only do it when the weather is lovely. In the cold of winter, no, or the heat of summer, also a no. And of course it can't be rainy either lol! However on pretty days, it's wonderful to take a moment and enjoy the outdoors along with a bite to eat."
"Sonic is a cheap imitation. I eat in my car while driving due to my job. If you're hungry, eat. If someone stares at you look at it like you love it and are making love to it lol. "
Do they make rootbeer? Dog n suds rootbeer is the best but I'm not sure if it's the same company. I can't find it in michigan anymore. 
Me too
"How do you splattter soup?

Edit : I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs the same way I put three T‚Äôs in splatter?"
...blood? I might need some elaboration here
"Ah yes the poop jar, pee bottle, and cumbox, the cars humbler version of RV bathrooms. "
I mean who doesn‚Äôt? And when it gets all nice and full you go be a Good Samaritan and dump it in your neighbors garden 
"""Well, sirs! I don't know about any of that, but this Frozen Custard is pretty good!"""
"Same here except we didn't get detained and my friend was my prom date and we knew the park was closed (I think)  and we almost got caught doing...things. 

I think he he knew it was prom night and sympathised that we were just a couple of kids, so he just let us off with a warning, thankfully. "
I... what? People have been driving since the 70s hell the 70s had much more of a car oriented culture than we do today. For some extent I say he‚Äôs right. It‚Äôs definitely a fat and out of shape thin for me when I drive down the block to get some snacks at the gas station instead of walk. But whatever 
You don‚Äôt like any of those things?!? What kind of person are you! Lol. Well I wish you the best of times eating in your car as well

"I consider online and long distance relationships to be different. If you met online but never met irl, then I doubt it'll last. (of course there are exceptions, there always are.) 

But LDRs (people who have started their relationships irl) can survive depending on the people involved and the nature of the relationship. It takes a lot of work, effort, committment, honesty, etc. It's really hard, so they don't often succeed, but I have seen it work out."
"I do. We've been in a long distance for many years (I mean, half of our lives) and recently we ended up moving together and planing our future wedding."
"Mine was odd, she was technically local but worked 9 hours away for two weeks at a time. Then she moved 3 hours away and i only saw her some weekends. Now she is local and we get married in two months. Can work. "
"Define long distance, also it varies by amount of commitment both in the relationship have, two people from my school have stayed together for 2 years so far and they live 2500 miles apart, they see eachother twice a year "
"I have been in two, but they did not work due to some beliefs that were expressed but not taken seriously. One was long distance for a year and the other for 2 years. One of my guy friends was long distance from his current fianc√© for a year, but they moved into together after that. So yes, depending on the situation. "
"Yes, but you really have to be in it for the long haul and put in a solid effort. It's worth a shot, though! Keep communication open and try to do small gestures to show your love and appreciation despite the distance. "
"It would take maintaining a dialogue every day, and serious commitment, I reckon. But the physical availability could be a problem. Seeing each other on Skype, messaging, talking, but not being close to each other, at least every once in a while, could serve as tiresome and even heartbreaking."
"Oh absolutely!! My husband is Australian and I'm American, we met summer of 2014. We spent 2 years long distance and been married 2 years this October. It was definitely a rough and rocky ride but worth every moment!! I wish you all the luck if you try it again. It's not an easy thing to do but finding others who have been successful definitely helps!"
"I was long distance for 5 years. We even got married, we had plans for her to come her to the states. Her paperwork was basically done (it took a year), and then her twin sister died. She no longer wanted to move over here with me. She wanted to stay in her home country and she left me.

So we survived 5 years LD. But ended up splitting when she no longer wanted to make the move. I think it's possible, but it is significantly more difficult."
Yes. But you need to spend a lot of time talking to each other to make it work. It‚Äôs very easy to just slip away or forget and slowly drift apart. There‚Äôs a lot of commitment to it and it can be worth it. 
"Absolutely, if it‚Äôs with the right person.  Mainly, as long as the trust is there.  My husband and I were long distance (2,000 miles) for 2 years before we were able to move to the same city.  "
"My girlfriend and I did long distance for two years in high school before we got to college together. I'd say it most definitely can work if both people are willing to put in work and are really compatible with each other. 

Unfortunately, people do change and sometimes that means people can fall out of LDR if they change too much. That happened to me in my first one. It's a gamble you have to be willing to take though. "
"I feel like yes, but personally only if it's a means to an end. I could do long distance if it was for sure we would meet some day. I think without that I wouldn't be able to justify it, as I want a house and kids and a life with that person. But maybe for the right person it could work. "
Oh wow that‚Äôs great! Kudos to ya üòÅ 
"I guess I mean like they don‚Äôt get to see other much and meet very rarely.
And Yh I agree both parties have to be very serious and committed when it comes to long distance relationships "
Ah I‚Äôm sorry it didn‚Äôt work out for ya. Same with me. It‚Äôs just hard to know how much gravity they give to things they say when it‚Äôs not face to face 
That's really great! I guess it's all about finding the right match of people
For sure! If the people really aren't right for each other it'll never work. But I'm convinced he's my one <3
"I would ask people directly instead of posting it on social media. That way you don't plan for people to come over and no one does, or too many people come over and you get overwhelmed. Ask someone else to host! Maybe you can just have a quiet party and play board games! Something simple and not too overbearing. It's your day! So do what you like to do!  "
"Try going out for drinks or food. I'm 18 and whenever someone in my group has their birthday he would take us out to a place of choice and maybe also pay the whole bill. It doesn't matter if it's beers, wine, clubing, eating etc. Just gather some friends and go out"
"I guess one of the reasons why social media (I would have posted it then saying to ask me for the details) is because I wouldn‚Äôt know exactly who to invite and those I didn‚Äôt wouldn‚Äôt have to see I didn‚Äôt invite them because I could have just said I made a post about it.

Thank you. Right now I am trying to see if I can get someone to host but I am trying to be respectful"
I miss these parties. My friends in high school loved to sit around and play cards before they went to college and the type of partying changed to what you would expect.
Where do you live around?
Fair enough! You can always ask those you know you want to invite and then post it on social media! That's what I would do. Best of luck OP! If I knew you I would host it at my house! 
"The college I attend is regarded as a ""party school"" and there are still plenty of people who enjoy just hanging out without being crazy. Just gotta join some clubs to find those people!"
Greece
Thanks!!!!!
That's a good point. I've always really wanted to play D&D but I can't find anyone to play with. I know there are people around but I'm too in my own bubble and busy.
The reason I asked is because you have to be 21 to drink here so getting alcohol wouldn‚Äôt really be easy or something we could do at a club or place to eat at
"Well then I guess if you prioritise whatever you're busy doing currently then you're doing it right! I try to shake up my schedule a bit once I fall too much into a monotonous routine. 

The concept of D&D sounds pretty interesting to me but I have no idea where to even start lol"

A person who purposely aims to hurt you is not a person you should allow in your life for any amount of time. Especially since there have been other events in this relationship. End it and have a fabulous time on your holiday.
"You're too young to continue this toxic relationship with your girlfriend. Besides all of the arguments and her insecurities, her behavior of ripping up the gift you made to show you how much che can hurt you is abusive. This is not okay. Break up with her and live your life."
"‚ÄúI will not hook up while traveling‚Äù is not a promise you need to make when in a healthy relationship... it‚Äôs just understood.

This is a really weird and sad relationship and I am 1000% confident you can find a better relationship for you. "
"I would advise you to break up with her. I don't know if you are partly responsible for how toxic this relationship has become and to what extent, since you don't say what you argue about and what this thing that she had to get past is, but it sounds like you both resent each other, and it sounds like she's so focused on her bitterness and anger that she literally doesn't notice when you try to show her affection. Let her go, you no longer make each other happy and walking out after what she did was the right thing. "
"Uhhhhhhhh this sounds like a second away from a seriously abusive and controlling situation.


‚ÄúI put rules on it to show how I‚Äôll behave on holiday.‚Äù

Are you okay? 


Also what were you fighting about? That part seems important.

The important thing is if she was aiming to hurt you in any way just to prove a point you NEED to leave. This won‚Äôt get better. "
"She's weaponized a gift in order to hurt you all the more in an argument. She cared nothing for you, nothing for the precious gesture made in that gift, and worse, it wasn't done in the heat of the moment but was rather a deliberate, knowing action intended to sting.

She's malicious in her anger. Don't be with someone like that. It only ends badly.
"
"Yes, break up with her.  
If she had torn the think up impulsively in a moment of anger, that would still be bad, but might be something you could work through.  
In this case, she did it very deliberately, with the stated intention of hurting you. 
Break up, because she is too immature for a relationship. Anyone who deals with disagreements by purposefully hurting the other person (either physically or emotionally) is someone to be avoided."
Saw in your comments that the girl is 14. Break up with her yesterday. 
"I'm so sorry you're hurting. What a painful situation to be in.

I think when you're a teenager, sometimes you overlook behaviors that you would never accept if you were an adult in a mature marriage. Imagine for example if I told my husband every morning ""You'd better not hook up with anyone while you're at work today. I need you to prove it. Prove you won't be cheating on me."" What kind of marriage would that be? I love and trust my husband, I don't need that kind of verification from him.

Imagine if my husband and I had a disagreement. It happens, all couples disagree now and then. I'm not going to go out and take a sledgehammer to his car to hurt him, to show that I have the control in the relationship. That would be a crime, that would be a terrible thing to do. But it's basically what your girlfriend did to you. When a man punches a woman in the face, to show her who's boss, that's what your girlfriend did when she tore up the gift you made her. It's a control tactic. Your girlfriend wants you to be terrified to stand up to her. But a relationship needs honesty and love, not control and terror.

My husband has to travel for work now and then. I don't get upset, I don't demand that he follow a set of rules, I don't make him check in with me. Instead, I tell him how much I love him, and that I'll miss him. I tell him to try and have a great time, and treat himself to a nice dinner if he can get away from work for a bit. I tell him I can't wait to see him and hear all about it when he gets back. I let him know I'm here for him if he has the time for a quick call, and if not, I absolutely understand. I'm here to support him in whatever he needs, not badger him into doing what I say. We're a team, not rivals.

You need a girlfriend who is a true teammate, not an opponent. I'm so sorry for the pain you're going through. Someone who truly cared about you would never tear up a gift that you made for them. My heart hurts for you, thinking of the time and effort you put into such a loving gift, and having her destroy it in a moment of anger, simply because she felt entitled to controlling you. It sounds like you're a great boyfriend, and you can make another woman really happy. But it sounds like the girl you're dating now will never be happy unless you are in her full control. She's not a good partner or teammate, she sees you as a rival, someone she needs to conquer. That's not how we treat people we claim to love. Love shouldn't be a combat zone, it should be our safe place. She hasn't done much to give you a safe place in this relationship."
"It doesn't matter how old you are. Anyone who says out of their actual face that they want to hurt you when they're mad does NOT love you. Love does not include deliberately hurting your person. I'm sure there's times when you anger her, but ripping your gifts up is the crappiest way to handle it!"
"I am considerably older than you are and one thing I have learned in life is that when a relationship becomes toxic it has to end, no matter the short term pain. You're going to be just fine."
"It seems telling that you omitted her age, because that‚Äôs not a little detail. Girlfriend is 14 according to your previous posts. She‚Äôs acting immature cause she‚Äôs still a kid. Break up with her, find someone your own age."
">For the first time I'm actually considering breaking up with this girl. Do you guys think this may not be worth a break up?

In this post I have learned that your gf is immature, impulsive, and will do and say the most hurtful thing she can think of to punish you if you argue or disagree with her **and you've only been together for six months**. Yes, it is worth a breakup."
"So for everyone who is immediately blaming and judging the girl, OP didn't mention he is 17 and his girlfriend is 14. So I feel like people should consider that while making observations, cause the mental age gap is pretty big so ofcourse she is gonna act less mature.."
"Be done. She is both mean and crazy.

have a lot of fun on your vacation.  DOnt date mean crazy people"
This is abusive and toxic manipulative behavior. This is not ok. Leaving is the best option in my opinion. Don't stay with someone who tries to hurt you.
"> but I put my heart in the little gifts I give her

It is little things that bring the great joys of life. What she did is incredibly cruel. I think you deserve much, much, better."
"Sometimes people mistake dramatic relationships for passion and excitement. Don‚Äôt waste your time, that‚Äôs not love. All those times she cried and acted like you weren‚Äôt loyal or didn‚Äôt love her enough were power moves to test you and force you to keep coming back and giving her gifts. This time she overplayed her hand."
Someone who feels the need to prove to you that they can hurt you if they want is not the kind of person you should have in your life.
"EDIT: Okay just saw that you said that she is 14? You should‚Äôve added that to your post as that greatly changes that advice I and many others would give you.


I‚Äôll just keep it short, breakup with her.

Don‚Äôt waste your time on someone so toxic and insecure. Fuck her off."
"Her need for control and constant worries about your behavior is more troubling to me than just her mean and immature method of arguing. 

A healthy relationship with this girl sounds like a remote possibility, if she's willing to do some kind of therapy and possibly be medicated. You're young. It may be best to just move on and learn from her what you don't want in your next relationship."
"Objectively, I can understand why you would feel puzzled, it's just paper, right?
Yeah.

It was the intent that matters, she knew tearing that handcrafted gift of yours to her would hurt you. That's why she did it, she said it herself even, then she did IT! Crazy, right?!

You're only young, what you do in your teen years would effect how you would approach relationships in the future, let this be a lesson. Break up with her, nobody needs shitty behaviour like that, you shouldn't accept it all, if you do, chances are that she'll do something like that again and that's no Bueno.
"
"Sorry but it seems like this crap is deliberate and generally despicable. Your (soon to be ex)girlfriend did not want to listen or talk out her issues and insecurities; she's so focused on her feelings that she did not care about yours. Bottom line is that she wanted to hurt you *and even stated her intent*. How clearer can this be?

Nothing justifies this shit behavior, OP, and you're too young to be wasting your time on someone who isn't appreciative and isn't willing to even try to be respectful of your feelings. It isn't the first time she's done this. She'll do it again. Break up and move on. "
"Only the title was needed to know you need to bail, abandon ship! This kind of behavior will escalate. "
you have just learned a valuable lesson and you are only 17. That is what toxic looks like. You need to end it and watch for it in the future. Do not allow toxic people in your life. 
"If your partner hurts you on accident, that‚Äôs fixable. If your partner hurts you on purpose, that‚Äôs abusive. 

This is an early sign of emotional abuse. She did this to exercise power over you. You guys have only been dating for six months - if she is comfortable doing this in the honeymoon phase, how nasty is it going to get?"
"Also if she's 14 and you're 17 you really shouldn't be dating her. Using the standard half your age plus seven , you shouldn't be dating anyone younger than 15 and a half. Yeah, it matters. "
"> Not sure how to procede

She is free to easily hurt you, and you are free to easily dump her.  Problem solved."
"That is an extremely toxic statement in a relationship.

Along with:

* I want to test you.
* I just want to see if you ...
* You hurt me YOU hurt me **YOU** hurt me

These are toxic statements, and I hope you know what to do at this point."
"I hope you're not sleeping with her, given that she's 14 years old, a literal child and in many countries that shit is illegal."
Life's too short to deal with mean girlfriends.
"Hey. This isn't going to work, I'm in an LDR and like, yeah we argue but we'd never do shit like this. In fact we had a BIG BIG argument that lasted a long time in the last year, but I still even kept one of the little hand made gifts my bf gave me on my person the whole time. I wouldn't destroy it just because we're arguing, that would be really insane. 

LDRs require balance and communication. If she's so impulsive and destructive and wants to make demonstrations out of how she can hurt you - leave. Because that's not a balanced relationship.

You should break up with her and consider going no contact I think. 

And then have fun on your holiday. You're not responsible for this girls insanity, but do make it clear, in text, clear as day ""I'm sorry, but I don't want to date you anymore. You've shown yourself to be a vindictive person and I don't deserve that. This is not an argument, I am done, please don't contact me again."" I know people say texts are cheap, but with LDRs you don't really get the benefit of doing it otherwise. Also I feel like if you call her she will just argue and complain and cry and .... she's not a stable sounding person ok. It doesn't sound like you CAN talk to her. 

Do it in a way that is clear, detached, and leaves no wiggle worm for this psycho. 

Also, I can expect that she will start either sending you videos of her destroying all the gifts you've given her over time, or posting them on social media. If that bothers you, you might want to block her several places. 

Good luck."
"Both too young, it's a learning lesson, move on and find someone else "
"This is so mean and petty. This is an ok thing to break up with her over. 

Be kind to yourself"
"You know what? You sound like a really cool romantic guy. Those gifts you make sound amazing! I just wanted to stop in to say, don‚Äôt let this experience ever stop you from being creative with your gift-giving in your future relationships. 

There are girls/women out there who will love them and appreciate the time/effort/thought you put into them. This girl isn‚Äôt that person, unfortunately. "
"You should not have to work so hard, and write letters to your girlfriend ""proving"" that you won't cheat on her, unless you have given her good reasons to believe that you are unfaithful. Those are her insecurities to work out, and you shouldn't feed them any more than if she said ""If you don't start walking with your left foot first every time you go somewhere, then you will cause my parents to divorce."" She is unreasonable, and her insecurities are HERS to get over. If you have given her reasons to suspect that you won't be unfaithful, then you have poisoned the relationship, and she is unable to get over it. You should sever it for both of your sakes, and go be single for a few months and discover yourself.

That was completely callous to tear up a gift in front of you, and try to tear you down with threats. You're only 17. You've only been together 6 months. You need to break up with her because she has shown that she is directly going to try to hurt you if she doesn't get her way. The first 6 months is supposed to be the honeymoon period, and you are already dealing with this drama and this abuse. Go on your trip with your family and surround yourself with them. Block your girlfriend's number so that you don't get dragged back into this during your vacation."
"You‚Äôre 6 months in, cut your losses and split. "
"Please break up with her. This isn‚Äôt healthy for
You. "
"In relationships, you're going to hurt the other person with words and actions at some time. It's unavoidable, but it shouldn't be a *goal*.  Accidentally hurting your partner through thoughtlessness is one thing.  She deliberately set out to hurt you and basically called attention to her desire to hurt you.   

Get out. "
No contact sounds like a good idea.
I read the title of your post and instantly knew how to proceed. Dump her. 
"If you're arguing this much six months in, and she's ready to cavalierly destroy gifts just to hurt you, you're better off breaking things off and starting over with someone who's actually compatible with you."
"> Not sure how to proceed.

Easy, don‚Äôt!

It‚Äôs a toxic relationship and you shouldn‚Äôt be grueling through it. Tell her why you‚Äôre doing it too, so she hopefully can learn from this and not pass on the toxicity to her next relationship. "
Life is too short to put up with this kind of drama.
"Please break up with her.

  
Actions have consequences.  And the consequence of someone being purposely cruel should be to lose that person.  I repeat this a lot here, but we teach people how they are allowed to treat us.  If you let her treat you this way, she will get comfortable in doing so, and will continue this pattern.  Basically, what I'm saying is, if you stay - she will continue to do this to you - and chances are, she'll just get worse.    


You sound like a wonderful young man who pours your heart and soul into your gifts and your relationship.  Find someone who treats you the same way.  Have a great holiday with your family!  
"
"How old is your girlfriend? Another commenter ssid shes 14. 

She hurt you on purpose and that is jot someone to be with.  If she is 14, she is literally a child and is acting like one.  She also doesnt trust you since you said shes afraid of you doing something bad.

This is not someone id want to be with personally and not someone id want my friends to be with. "
"In case it needs saying again, exit asap. I've been near where you are now and I wish I had people who could've told me what everyone is telling you. This is not a good, healthy, or proper relationship. Exit asap."
"This girl is a psycho. Get out before she rips your actual heart up, man!"
"Yeah I say end it. Not so much because she tore up the gift, but because of everything else you're saying - how you constantly have to reassure her, how she doesn't trust you, and of course how mean and self-righteous she gets, with little regards to your feelings. 
She has deep-rooted self-esteem issues which you'll always suffer under and which you can't fix. If you were older I might advice some joint counseling, but seeing as you're so damn young (jealous), I say: don't waste your time. Live your life, experience some healthy live that makes you feel good. It shouldn't be hard work just yet."
"You're both young, she might not realize how wrong her behavior is, but it's still wrong. When I was 17 I would say and do whatever I could to get a reaction when I was arguing with my boyfriend, and he would do the same back to me. It doesn't mean we're awful, toxic people, it means that we were young and didn't know how to be with another person.


This incident probably had a lot leading up to it. Her tearing up the drawing was her way of getting a reaction out if you. It doesn't mean she's a bad person, but it was mean and callous. If you stay with her, it's possible that you can work through this and grow up together.


The more likely outcome of you staying together is that she will see that she can push you that far and continue to see how far she can push you until you find yourself in a much more stressful position. 


My advice to you would be to break things off. Long distance is extremely hard with a healthy relationship, let alone one without trust, as yours seems to be, plus it seems emotionally exhausting. She might grow out of this sort of behavior, but it's not up to you to make her do so or allow yourself to be bullied waiting for her to. "
"I would break up with her. It looks like she was trying to tell you how much control she had for not hurting you before, which is clearly a sign of some sort of manipulation. It's not worth continuing a relationship like that. Things might escalate and get uglier than it already has."
"Break up!!! You are 17 and have only been dating a few months. She is not worth the drama and sounds like a very insecure, selfish, jealous, immature person, she will breed a very unhealthy kind of relationship. Move on, there is no reason here for you to stay any longer in a relationship that will likely only go downhill."
"Everyone gets mad, everyone has thoughts of hurting people when they are mad, healthy people do not actually try and hurt the people they love. 

I think you need to take an honest look at this relationship. "
"I think that the mark of a good relationship is that even in the most heated argument, you put the other person first, above the disagreement at hand. E.g. one classic piece of advice for a happy marriage is ""always kiss goodnight, no matter how angry you are with the other person.""

Your girlfriend (soon to be ex) does not do that.

BTW, your little gifts sound adorable. I hope you find a wonderful new woman to appreciate them - and you. This time someone living closer.

"
"People who love each other don't treat each other like this, in my most angriest at my BF I would never do or say something I KNEW would hurt him just to hurt him. I might hate him in that moment, but I still love him.

Proceed right out the door on this relationship, this is not a woman who loves you. This is a woman who loves controlling you. She is more attached to her jealousy and anger than she is to you."
"Verdict is in bro. Back away not today disco lady. You're 17, enjoy yourself now before life hits you hard, and it will after you graduate.

She needs to never be allowed to get away with behavior like that without consequences. The proper consequence here is to leave her. Not to mention, you need to learn that you should never ever be with someone who tries to hurt you, let alone trying to train you with it by making using her ability to hurt you as a punishment for making her angry. This is so fuckng sbusive and fucked up. Leave yesterday"
"My daughter is 17, and if she did this or someone did this to her, I'd be pissed off. Maybe in a few years she'll be ready for a relationship. Don't assume she's going to be a toxic person her whole life. She's a kid still. So are you."

Even if she was immediately sorry for what she did, I think it's not because she was really sorry.  I think it's because she revealed to you what a crazy psycho she is, before she meant to.

"> This morning we were arguing about something that I thought we had gotten past. When I thought she had calmed down, I told her to look at the thing I left on her desk yesterday. She took the piece of paper, looked at it, read it, and told me it was awesome. She then jokingly told me that had she remembered it while we were arguing, she would have tore it up. Half an hour later, we're arguing again. 


this is a seriously massive amount of red flags, you're 17 man, you two don't need to be arguing every 30 minutes or you'll start to think this is normal in every relationship. "
"You go out of your way to make her gifts and such, and she treats you like this? She‚Äôs a brat, and you sound like a nice guy. End it, and find a girl that appreciates how awesome you are."
"This relationship isn‚Äôt healthy for either one of you. In a healthy relationship, you don‚Äôt fight as much as you two do and there isn‚Äôt any vindictiveness like your girlfriend showed. End it. Block her. "
"The comments about behaviour when traveling and the ""joke"" about tearing it up concerns me more. 

I'll be frank, there have been two occasions (one on each side) in my relationship of two years where presents have been damaged. When I did it, it was an incredibly emotionally charged moment and I honestly didn't expect him to forgive me. I repaired the items and told him if he wanted them, they're his but I understood if he didn't. When he did it, I was devastated and again personally retrieved the items and repaired them. Just as I didn't expect him to forgive me, I wasn't sure I could forgive him. 

The difference I see here is that on the two occasions this has happened in my relationship, it's been pure angry emotive response. Nothing pre planned, just breaking point. With this, particularly given the context you gave, it was not only premeditated but she only expressed regret when you left, thus making it clear this was not on. That isn't regret, that's a realisation her behaviour won't fly. With my BF and I, we instantly came down to earth after that action and profusely apologised. That she didn't immediately is bad.

"
"Seriously you're 17, you shouldn't be dealing with this level of 'messed up' in a relationship. She's insecure, jealous to the point of paranoia, manipulative and emotionally abusive. It's not healthy for either of you to stay in this relationship. You are far too young and she needs therapy/to grow up. Her actions repulsed you so much because that survival part of your brain kicked in and is telling you to run far, far away. By the sounds of it there's probably a few more glaring red flags you've not mentioned in this relationship. You're young, this is just a 6 month old relationship and long distance at that. Go no contact and move on."
"When someone shows you who they are, believe them. "
"She told you she wished she had done it during the fight, then waited for an opportunity to do it, deliberately, knowing full well it would hurt you. HOPING it would hurt you. 

You don't really need us to tell you how awful she is as a person, she's shown you first hand."
"Sheesh. I think that‚Äôs so sweet that you made little gifts for her but the fact that she is comfortable with tearing one up to prove a point to you or ‚Äúhurt‚Äù is a form of emotional abuse. It‚Äôs manipulation. You do not deserve to deal with something like that and if you do decide to break up with her, I‚Äôm sure you will find someone who will love and appreciate you, your creativity and the love you give !! Stay strong !"
Get out of there. Now. That shit is going to persist.
"She sounds immature and insecure. Her being worried about you behaving badly on your trip probably has nothing to do with your behavior, unless you have given her reason to not be trusted.  It sounds like instead it has to do with her level of self-confidence and instead of communicating that to you maturely, she hurts you instead. Find someone else who can communicate maturely and has enough love for themselves to believe they are worth being loved. Though, at 17, that may be difficult"

"I'm not going to sugar coat this...
Leave her. 

You're young, have miles apart between you, and have so much more life to live to find something better.

If she does try and ""hurt"" you, remember that the small amount of emotional distress you suffer through is much less worse than the potential amount of suffering you'd live with if you stayed together.

Abusive people don't change. Their tactics might, but they're not going to stop trying to control and hurt you

Edit: there to the"
"This sounds like a clear emotional outburst on her part. You said you‚Äôve been dating for some time so I‚Äôm wondering, has she ever done anything like this in the past? If not, it‚Äôs a little concerning that this occurred simply because it‚Äôs a huge overreaction. 

What exactly were you fighting about? You said it was something you thought you had gotten past, but it sounds like she hasn‚Äôt. Was this a mundane everyday fight or something that you simply didn‚Äôt want to discuss but she did? There‚Äôs a pretty big difference between gotten over and repressed to avoid further conflict. Buried emotions never end well for either party involved.

Regardless, her behavior indicates a larger problem in the future. If she‚Äôs willing to tear your gifts up in the heat of an argument, she could be an abusive partner. I think you should express to her how that made you feel and decide what‚Äôs best from there. If she‚Äôs not apologetic or tries to spin it to make you look like the bad guy, it‚Äôs time to move in and find someone who will appreciate your gifts. Best of luck, dude. You‚Äôre very young and have lots of time to find a compatible partner."
"The first red flag was how she was worried about you not behaving on your trips. That is not healthy is any kind of relationship. This should be the tip of the iceberg. If you continue on with this relationship, you're going to have worse arguments."
"I have been there, she wants to see you suffer so she can be in control, so she feels like the winner in the argument. Break up."
"Ok, you're 17.  You don't need to deal with the difficulties of a LDR.  You don't need someone who is an emotional anchor, having to always reassure them you won't stray.  You don't need someone that likes to cause you harm.

Being single would be an improvement."
RUN! You do not need that negativity in your life. 
"also being 17, no matter how much it hurts, get out. i was in total denial to leave my ex until she left me completely broken even though i saw all the signs to get out. usually i wouldn‚Äôt say to break up with someone, but this is, as it‚Äôs been said, one step from an abusive relationship. she‚Äôs getting controlling and trying to make you react so she can have the upper hand and guilt you into things. my ex used to do the same stuff (get into arguments and then use unrealistic ways to get into my head so i felt like the one in the wrong). trust me, if you don‚Äôt discuss this with her right now or break up with her, it‚Äôs only going to get worse. if you want to talk about it with her just be very calm and explain how you felt about that, and make sure there‚Äôs no way she can get mad during that discussion. "
"Why would you want to be with someone who actively plans out ways to hurt you, tells you so you know it's planned, then follows through? "
This sounds so toxic. I too put all of my heart and soul into handmade gifts that take hours on end so I‚Äôll say that this after fighting would be my last straw. I don‚Äôt know what you were fighting about but it is clear that she would purposefully hurt you in order to maintain control. Nobody deserves that. Get out and find someone who will treat you right!
"Every relationship is going to have arguments.  Part of having a healthy relationship is arguing in a healthy, productive manner.  This is at best an unproductive method and at worst potentially abusive behaviour.

Just leave."
Yikes dude. Walk away. You don't need that kind of toxicity in your life.
I think you should break off the relationship immediately and then do some light therapy before you get stuck in a cycle toxic relationships. 
"Mega long distance and she tries to hurt you? Bail out ASAP. You deserve better and they don't deserve you.

Also, make sure your behaviour is above reproach"
You calmly and quickly proceed to the door.
That's a red flag whose dye was made from a bunch of melted down red flags 
"You're 17 man, you have your whole life to enjoy better relationships. Don't waste time on her. 

"
Break up with her. You‚Äôre too young to be dealing with this kind of emotionally unstable person. You‚Äôve got plenty of time to find a girl who‚Äôll be better to you. 
I read the first two lines and started typing- I'm convinced the rest doesn't matter. DUMP HER. That is beyond cruel. She purposely wanted to hurt you and was cruel enuf to admit it. Expect the next time to be worse. 
Don't look back. Just leave her. Save yourself for someone who cares about how you feel. 
"Nope.  Young people are irrational and mercurial, but that doesn't mean you should put up with an act of literal emotional terrorism. Ever. 

If you feel like it tell her by phone or text that you're done, but don't really go out of your way to not ghost her. She sucks and is too immature for you even though you're the same age. "
"How to proceed?   


She's long distance. Break it off. There are better people out there. "
"You're not exaggerating. This is a six-month relationship and you're already suffering arguments and she TORE your gift to purposefully hurt you. This isn't worth it. You're 17, move on and learn a lesson. Don't let yourself be treated this way. There are better people who won't do this to you even when you're in a disagreement. 

Also, you don't need to reassure the people you're dating that you won't hook up with others. "
"I hope you broke up with her over this pre-meditated betrayal. This sounds like a super unhealthy relationship. None of these ‚Äúpromises‚Äù sound healthy, even in long distance relationships. You seem like you really want someone to be comfortable with and them to be comfortable with you and it seems that you understand that that trust is earned. This isn‚Äôt the way. Being their punching bag is not cool. Break up, and I think you‚Äôll be better off. "
Find another girlfriend. This one sounds shitty
"She thinks you‚Äôre going to do something bad on your trips? So she is controlling. She sets conditions for you to be able to go or else she either hurts you emotionally or verbally. Mmk.

You need to cut her out of your life friend. You are too young to attach yourself to this toxic relationship. When you go out of your way to make her feel better ands her goes out of her way to hurt you- thats not ok.

Focus your energy into someone who will reciprocate it back in a healthy way."
"Personally and honestly, it's not worth it at your age. To argue in a relationship is normal but she didn't need to break your gift out of spite especially if you put your time and effort into it."
"Wayyyy too many red flags here in the first 6 months. It sounds like the long distance is the healthiest part of this relationship for you. 

I‚Äôm breaking up if I‚Äôm in your shoes."
"So youve been together 6 months. She has absolutely no trust to the point you have to reassure her you wont cheat on a family trip. She purposely tries to hurt you. She brings up the past and things youve already resolved in arguments. Run, theres so many better options out there."
"Move on from this girl.  Believe it or not, there is a beautiful woman who matches you in amazing ways and ACTUALLY CARES about your happiness!!! When people care about each other it‚Äôs possible to stay happy together. "
"I‚Äôm sorry she treated you like this. You deserve respect and kindness in a relationship and it doesn‚Äôt sound like she gives you either. She‚Äôs toxic, get out before she gets her talons hooked any further.
Remember, you deserve happiness."
In five years you'll look back at this as a nutty teenage relationship. Break up!
"Break up with her. You're 17, there are a billion other women out there who are better than her. Go have some fun boi. "
"Yep, break up with her. You don't even owe her an explanation. Ghost her."
"One thing to remember is this.

She used that on you twice.

Once yesterday & once today.

Shes holding on to any ammunition you give her to use on you.

And quite apparently, that card was a torpedo in the water since yesterday, just waiting to hit you with it.

Obviously it's not going to change anytime soon.

Dude, love yourself as much as you are expecting anyone else to, and walk away.

Why would you continue to hurt yourself by being with someone who is just itching to hurt you?"
"She sounds toxic as all hell and is using you for some emotional validation. Ditch her. She HURT you, on purpose, and all but spit on something you yourself said you poured your whole spirit into. Absolutely no one deserves that dude."
"Read the title you typed out. Now read it again as if it was someone else that wrote it and you were just reading it without any other knowledge of their relationship. What would you tell them?

It's been six months and you don't need to put up with this. Hell, even if it was six or sixteen or twenty six years, you wouldn't need to put up with this. Just leave."
Throw in towel and turn the corner
"I found myself in a situation where BOTH my wife and my mother in law acted like this. It was hell. I had to divorce to find happiness again. Leave her, you will find someone better."
Run run run and never never never look back.
"She's toxic, you're never going to be happy with her, and you're young enough to dump her and move on without a second thought."
"Break up with her, she's crazy, and you're only 6 months in. She should still be swooning in honeymoon phase, not starting bs arguments multiple times a visit. Don't date people who like to fight. Fighting has no place in an adult relationship. I know you are both very young yet, but she's pulling some middle-school level drama. Ignore her Tex s and block her, and you'll be much happier."
"She‚Äôs toxic, get out "
Fuck that. Bail. Anyone that purposely tries to hurt you during an argument is not worth wasting your time on. 
Yeah this is just simply break up time
You proceed with ending the relationship. 
You proceed with ending the relationship. 
"She's psychologically abusive. Leave and don't look back. If you're not even in your 20's (I'm assuming she's 20 or less), and it's already THIS bad, it's only going to get worse.

Don't listen to her messages either. She's going to tell you she didn't mean it, you misunderstood her (gaslighting), promise you this or that, and so on. Block her out of your life, your social media. Do not look back."
"It‚Äôs obvious she‚Äôs clingy, doesn‚Äôt trust you at all, and is willing to go the extra mile to cause you emotional pain. You know what to do OP"
"People do and say anything when they're angry. However, at 17, you shouldn't be putting up with her uncontrolled anger issues. She sounds like she's making you miserable. 

Relationships take hard work and it's a two way street, and as much effort as you seem to be putting in, it doesn't seem like that's happening. 

Take a step back and evaluate if you see yourself with this girl in 6 months. If the answer is no, don't complicate your life by keeping her in it. If the answer is yes, talk to her about establishing boundaries and tell her, as bluntly as you can, how you feel and how she made you feel. 

You'll both be required to have incredible amounts of maturity in getting past this. "
Dont even ‚Äúbreak up.‚Äù You‚Äôre already broken up. That was some bullshit on top of a ton of other bullshit. 
"Yiiiiikes!

Literal psychopath. "
"You really should leave. That‚Äôs a sign of abuse- she‚Äôs trying to control and manipulate you. Someone who cared about you would never do anything to hurt you on purpose even in the heat of an argument. I cherish everything my long time boyfriend has ever given me, and I would never rip something up to upset him because they mean a lot to me too. He worked hard on all the little notes and things and when he does something that upsets me we sit down and talk it out even if we‚Äôre both frustrated. You should never feel stepped on like how she seems to be trying to make you feel."
"You just experienced someone telling you that they WANT you to know how much they can hurt you. Friend, girlfriend, etc, that's not the kind of person you need to *choose* to have in your life. And it's her responsibility to work on that for herself. If you would ever consider being in a relationship with her, it should only be after time apart, and she must express understanding of where she went wrong and a change of that entire thought process. Tell her that you deserve better than someone who wants to show you pain, and she deserves better than to be with someone who she feels the desire to cause hurt, and you wish her well on that journey. "
"Everyone‚Äôs telling you to break up with her and while I‚Äôd normally agree - not every stupid thing everyone does is a sign of an abusive relationship. This subreddit is crying abusive relationship for everything that happens. 

At the end of the day here are the things I‚Äôve gathered from what *you‚Äôve* told us. You‚Äôre a sweet guy who puts a lot of emphasis on thought and soul in your relationship. You make handmade gifts and you‚Äôre conscientious of your girlfriend‚Äôs feelings and want to reassure her insecurities.

Your relationship is also super young, you are super young, you‚Äôre in an LDR, and especially at your age - distance in a relationship can easily cause insecurities and distress. 

I‚Äôll give you advice in two fold. We don‚Äôt know the extent of your fights but if you choose to continue this relationship it‚Äôs because you see something special in your GF that can get through an error in judgment. You have to put your foot down and make sure she knows her behavior here is not acceptable and that in arguments neither of you should be trying to intentionally hurt each other ever.

If you choose to leave, you need to focus on yourself because at your age, your life is going to change drastically from year to year. There will be college, you might meet new people, you might realize that LDR isn‚Äôt for you in this situation, whatever the case.

You seem like a good kid who really thinks things through rather than acting purely on emotion - so trust yourself. I believe in you OP."
"I see people saying to you that this is a toxic relationship, and yeah it kind of is but personally I think it takes these toxic relationships as children to realize that you shouldn't play mind-games when you're an adult and it's not worth it.

Yeah, you are totally fine to break up with her because she hurt you. You are fine whether it was because she said she wanted to hurt you or because she ripped up a piece of paper. You don't need any justification to end the relationship and that's what teenage relationships are all about, or at least they were for me.

Learning that she ruined a relationship by doing something stupid like that will make future relationships better for her, and you learning that you're able to end relationships when they're no longer being positive for you will help you in the future even though it sucks now.

I'm sorry it hurts. I think fondly of my teenage relationships now because they helped me learn how to treat people,¬† but they were full of pettiness and drama at the time and hurt a lot as I learned what to look for in a partner and how to treat a partner. 

This can be good for you but I know it's hard to see that now. I'm sorry it hurts. You aren't alone. Best wishes. 

Edit: Looking back, I wanted to say I'm sorry if me saying children seems patronizing- I didn't mean it that way. These are real feelings you have and I'm not trying to belittle them. But the relationships in my 20s were way better than the relationships in my teens, and most of that wasn't the age change but just learning from the high school relationships. 

Each one is an important learning experience. I hope you learn not to put up with a partner who wants to hurt you, and I hope she learns not to try to hurt and manipulate future significant others. This is normal, and it typically takes these lessons to prepare us to be better in later relationships so we don't make these mistakes (as frequently, anyway.)"
"She's too immature for a strong, adult relationship. Break. Up."
">For the first time I'm actually considering breaking up with this girl. Do you guys think this may not be worth a break up? 

Not only this is worth a breakup, you should have just run to the hills and never go back. That girl is crazy."
What did she say in the text?
"Extremely psychotic behavior.  Why would she want to hurt someone she cares about, let alone show how easily it can be done.  You're so fucking young, get out NOW."
"To be fair she's hopefully old enough to grow out of this sort of thing but I would definitely break up. She's not right for you right now. There are people your own age who won't purposely be unkind to you.

ETA: This is bad behaviour and merits ending the relationship but I don't think a teenager doing this stuff should be viewed in the same way as a twenty something or older adult who does it."
She obviously isn't with you to bring enjoyment into each others' lives. I definitely think it is a good time to end it. 
"I would give it some time for you to cool down and see how she reacts. Everyone makes mistakes, even terrible ones. If she realizes how bad she was and makes it clear she will never react that way again, then I think you both learned a good lesson. If she simply can't understand why you were hurt and thinks you should just get over it, then I would try to move on. "
"In a healthy relationship, nobody *tries* to hurt anybody. Healthy couples can disagree on things, they can get upset with each other, but they don't intentionally set out to punish the other person by causing them pain. In conclusion, yes, this is worth breaking up over. "
Well she did tear up your promise to not hook up. Clearly it means she's giving you a pass!
Listen dude you‚Äôre young man. And one thing I hate about this subreddit is how extreme they are. People hurt man. People do things they regret. But to break up with a girl that you seem to be in love with over her ripping something in the moment isn‚Äôt the way to go. She‚Äôll remember this. She‚Äôll never do it again because of why you did after. It‚Äôs over now though. Don‚Äôt listen to people saying you should end it because that‚Äôs way too extreme.
What's locking you down to her? 
"Dude, RUN far away from tvis girl. She wants to hurt you, she will hurt you more. This CANNOT end well if you stay."
You should not be with someone like this. Even during arguments your SO should not do things to purposely hurt you and show you how they can hurt you. This type of person does not seem like the type of individual you should continue being in a relationship with. 
Dump her mate. You are much too young to deal with that level of spiteful shit. 
Showing you how easily she can hurt you is not a good sign. Sorry but she sounds toxic af
"Reading your description, it looks to me like you are broken up already. The connection you have shared has been severed. How you break the news to her is your call, but if I were in your shoes I would keep it honest, polite, growth-oriented and above all, non-negotiable and unambiguous."
"this story has way too much arguing in it for it to be anything but disaster. You guys are seriously having arguments every few HOURS? That's dysfunctional. It's one thing to debate or disagree but it's another thing to have fights where one person wants to emotionally hurt the other. You don't need this, you don't need someone being that ugly to you, and you definitely don't need to be around someone who let's you be that ugly to them if you're also responding to fights in such a way. there's nothing in your post that makes me think you're petty or mean like she is, but if you are and just haven't written about it here that's another huge consideration."
Major red flags. Breakup imminent. Do it sooner rather than later. 
"This girl has you in chains! In a normal relationship, a man and woman trust each other not to cheat--they don't use constant reassurances or accusations. You shouldn't have to make dramatic declarations of love every time she's worried about you fucking other girls--she should calm herself down. How little does she think of you to imagine you would cheat?  

Sometimes  people just pretend to worry about cheating, to use the accusation to control and abuse. ""oh, you don't want to cone over today? You must be cheating! Oh, you wanna spend time with your family or friends? Must be cheating! Oh, you won't insult and distance yourself from your female friend? Cheater!"" "
That‚Äôs incredibly childish of her. I would scoot out.
"Break up.

You're not in a healthy relationship and she'll continue to pull stuff like this if you cave.  Tell her you are breaking up with her and block her on everything.  "
"Leave her. You should never be with someone who purposefully hurts you and if you're fighting frequently only a few months in, that's not a good sign."
"The best advice I can give is make it known her actions are not okay. Put your foot down and set firm boundaries. 

I don't like that she already is worrying about what you will or won't do while you're away, to me that's an indication of trust issues. On top of the fact that she made a choice to do what she did in order to deliberately hurt you. These are red flags to toxic behaviors, and you are not wrong for considering leaving her. You are also not wrong or being unfair if you do decide to end the relationship. 

Most people who manipulate or behave that way do so because they need to feel like they're in control. There is also a good chance that over time her actions/manipulation/trust issues will become worse. 

I don't mean to come off as a downer, but I am also speaking from personal experience from dating someone who exhibited these behaviors and tendencies. Two years later, I was miserable, and actually trying to detach myself from that person's grips was hellish.  
 
Please do not be afraid to put yourself first. Leaving people that you care about is always difficult but your happiness and mental health is more important than anything. It's easy to become trapped in a toxic cycle like that.  

Take care of yourself, do what you have to do, and no matter how much she might cry or act distraught over the breakup, don't let it sway you. You deserve someone who loves, cherishes, and trusts you rather than projecting her own insecurities and problems onto you. That is not healthy. "
"My boyfriend and I are LDR. I absolutely treasure any kind of gift or trinket he buys or makes for me because HE gave it. I could never ever ever in a million years be able to tore it up just like that or throw it away like it was nothing. No matter how big of a fight we get in.

It's just... Unspeakable. "
"I‚Äôm not usually that keen on commenting and suggesting that people end relationships on this sub because there‚Äôs normally plenty of other people who do that way better then I could. 

Your story is relatable, however, and you really don‚Äôt need anyone that toxic in your life. I had an ex like that, one who would purposefully go out of her way to be destructive towards our relationship and no matter how many times I had tried to talk to her about it or work through it she would either come up with an excuse or say she would try to work on it. None of it worked. It was 9 months of beating myself up trying to figure out how to settle with being treated like that. 

Found a new girl who I‚Äôve been with for a while now. She once told me ‚ÄúI‚Äôd cry from happiness if you farted in a bottle and gave it to me‚Äù. And I partially believe her. That‚Äôs what you need OP. You sound like a really nice dude making handmade gifts (something I‚Äôve never done) and it seems like you might be able to find true happiness somewhere else. 

Don‚Äôt settle my man, and best of luck. "
"Just dump her. She‚Äôs toxic and hateful. That‚Äôs such a nasty, vindictive thing to do, and you don‚Äôt deserve it. An argument is one thing, but she did that literally *just* to hurt you. "
"If she can purposely hurt you like that with actions it‚Äôll only get worse. If there have been incidents like this b4 (name calling or other actions) I would end it ASAP. If not, hear her out but be cautious. Don‚Äôt let anyone disrespect you or try to break you down. Get those people out of your life."
She's immature and neurotic at best and controlling and vindictive at worst. Nope out. You've dodged a bullet.
"What a strange world we would live in if every human being was able to express themselves straight forwardly, say what they need to say the way they need to say it with the right timing and the best delivery.......BUT, that's not the world we live in. So, what do we do as humans? Give confusing messages with *hope* that others will say/take the actions that we ourselves are too uncomfortable to say or do. It sounds like shes already decided that she doesnt want to put her beat self into the relationship/you....and shes got an inhibition of conveying that to you in a respectful, adult, well-adjusted manner...instead, acting like a child. Maybe you should take a break from this relationship for awhile and see how things improve for you.
  
Never live in such a way that you wouldn't encourage your own loved one to live. You wouldn't want your loved one to be in a relationship like this one, why do you want this for you?
  
Xoxoxoxo"
she sounds needy and controlling and insecure. leave her ass.
"She is a cheater - that's why she's scared you will cheat too.   She will also turn out to be violent - mark my words, I've dated plenty of women like her.   Finish it now - and don't feel bad about doing it!"
"You're already long distance - if you wanted to hook up with people, you could just as easily do it at home. Long distance, manipulative and cruel girlfriend - dump her. "
"You have the potential to be in an amazing relationship with someone who reciprocates how you feel. I can‚Äôt imagine it feels good to constantly have to reassure her. I‚Äôm not sure what happened to make her question you so much, but wouldn‚Äôt it be nice if she was excited for you to enjoy your trip instead of make you feel insecure about leaving her? Don‚Äôt ignore your gut. Don‚Äôt lose yourself trying to give her the benefit of the doubt. 
In my opinion this absolutely warrants a breakup. Learn from this lesson and don‚Äôt settle for anything less than what you give. "
"There's no salvaging this, it's an unhealthy relationship and with the way she's acting she's not ready for a relationship in general. It'd be for the best to break things off, this isn't the kind of relationship you want to try and push through."
"I was in this for 3 years, your emotions are telling you they are done. They will never be back they were before that moment and you will never be free to be open with her again because your emotional body will never trust her again."
"first of all, she lacks faith in you - you seem so dedicated, but she still didn't want to trust you when you went on holiday with your *parents*. that she purposefully would aim to hurt you does it for me. how could you possibly disregard your hard work and love like that? why would she go crazy like this over an  argument? it feels immature and thoughtless to me. i was happy to read you left without a word. 

you've been with her for a while, so i can imagine how hard it must be to break up. there must have been happy times too. but this isnt healthy and not right. sorry you had to go through that. i hope you'll meet someone who does appreciate and respect you like they should, because this girl doesn't seem like someone who does that. "
Manipulating behavior and she screams insecurities. I would end it and make it clear why you‚Äôre ending it. That‚Äôs not how you treat someone no matter the type of relationship. She needs to take a look at herself and learn from her mistakes for her own future relationships. This needs to be eye opening for both of you. You‚Äôre both still young. I wouldn‚Äôt give her anymore chances personally. 
There are so many people in your life who will try to hurt you. Do you need your girlfriend to be one of them?
"I know from personal experience that this  stuff will only keep hurting you and it will keep happening no matter how many chances you give her. You deserve some one who will reciprocate and appreciate the things you do for them. It won‚Äôt always be perfect no matter who you date, but you deserve better then this abuse and mistreatment."
"If you have a girlfriend who needs to hear you say ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt hook up with others‚Äù then she already has no trust in you, cut that off 

Source: Had a girlfriend who did this, she didn‚Äôt want me to join a frat in college, breaking it off was freeing"
[removed]
Let her go. She‚Äôs toxic. A friend of mine was a similar situation for 2 ish years and this girl would straight up manipulate him and even tell him that she‚Äôs the best at hurting him. Love can blind you but you just need to realize that you deserve to be respected in a relationship.
I assume she is also a teen. This ks fairly normal. Okay to get upset about it because it hurt. Also okay to let her back in.
"Leave her bro, seriously leave her. She doesn't deserve you"
Immediately delet this relationship.
"It's time to say Bye Felicia!!!!! Seriously, there are so many other girls out there who would love and appreciate a guy like you. Don't waste your young years with someone who treats you like that #shecancelled"
"I think the fact that you don't know who's you would move forward says enough. Trust your gut and find someone who is going to appreciate your little gifts and reciprocate in their own way, not use them to hurt you."
GTFO while you have an out.  
"Run for your life. I promise you, in 10 years, you‚Äôll look back at this and say, ‚ÄúWtf was I thinking?‚Äù Please get out now and find a girl who trusts you not to cheat on her and doesn‚Äôt try to hurt you on purpose. Which is most normal girls. "
"When I am upset at my boyfriend, and I see the things he's done for me, it calms me down. It makes me cherish him more. Even when I can't see physical things, I recall in my mind the things he's done for me, just to keep myself in check.

Quite the difference."
"First and foremost. Break it off as quickly and cleanly as you can. Several of the things you mentioned are tell-tale signs of this being a girl who can and will be emotionally-abusive in the future. 
If someone makes something for you, they placed time, thought, and effort into making something that they thought you would love and appreciate. Right? You even think up gifts to give her every time you see her. By destroying that, she is letting you know that none of those things matter. Even if it was an argument, that is some downright messed-up thought processes to have premeditated destroying the gift before just to hurt you. 
You're 17, and you're too young to get hooked into a long-distance relationship with a girl who treats you like this. My recommendation? End it. You don't need this kind of negativity in your life when there are plenty of individuals out there who will love and care about you, and will never have the thought to destroy anything you personally have made. "
"I mean, she's literally showed you how easily she can hurt you and make you feel like shit, and not care about it at all. Does not sounds healthy at all..."
"You're young. 6 months is a pretty short time to already devolve into insecurities and bullshit in a relationship (granted, a healthy relationship never should). If I could go back in time and smack my 19-year-old self from getting into a 3 year, deeply unhealthy relationship, I would.  

For perspective, I'm now 30 and I'm with someone who is so incredibly emotionally intelligent, smart, considerate, and secure. Whatever issues she may or may not have, she knows how to deal with them and I support her and vice versa. But there is a difference between supporting someone and trying to fulfill every whim and insecurity. You're not equipped to deal with it. Most people aren't. 

I'm sure, at her core, she's a good person dealing with a lot. My previous relationship I was with a wonderful person who just had a lot of insecurities and emotional troubles and I stuck it out and I still care about her. No hard feelings. But it does take a toll.

With my current partner, it's so different. Sometimes I have to remind myself she isn't going to react a certain way. We communicate so well. It's great.

So if I can be your 30 year old self and smack you a bit. End the relationship. She will survive. You will survive. And if, for some reason, she doesn't. That's not on you.

Enjoy your holiday."
"I think it is worth sleeping on it and seeing it in the light of a new day and in the context of the whole relationship. Is her behaviour as a result of your going on holiday or does it occur every time you meet? Also, if she is unable to trust you while you are on holiday, how is she able to trust you the rest of the time you are apart? I also note you mention that it is you visiting her and making the gifts with no reciprocation from her.
These are her issues though, the lack of trust and a willingness to hurt you. You are not at fault and are making every effort to get the relationship working. It does not sound healthy. If this is a one-off incident, then it is hard to suggest staying or going. If it is a pattern of behaviour over several visits then you are best ending for your own sake. Either way, all the best and enjoy your holiday."
Sweetheart you and your girlfriend are both young. Break it off you don't need someone who does something abusive and immature in in your life like that.  
"Here are the warning signs I get from your post
1) she is worried you are going to cheat on her and is showing signs of being controlling
2) The constant arguing. You are 17, you dont need to argue, wait till you have a family and financial issues etc, how is she going to cope with that sort of pressure?
3) She is intentionally and maliciously trying to hurt you. 
"
"This incident can be a healthy learning experience for both of you. A LDR isn't easy for anybody, especially teenagers. She sounds immature and you should point out how hurt you are by her actions and why you are hurt. You don't have to break up, but you two should definitely learn and grow from this. "
"That's awful. You should never want to intentionally hurt your partner, and especially as blatantly as that and so in your face. Combine that with the fact that she doesn't seem to trust you and you have to talk to her an hour per day and promise no hookups on a FAMILY trip?? Not even spring break with the boys? And bringing past arguments up that you thought were already resolved, which means if she told you it was all good she lied to you.  Or she just likes to bring old shit up as a guilt trip or ""keeping score"" in the relationship. All kinds of red flags. 

This isn't a healthy relationship. I would get out if I were you. "
You're 17.... Relationships and life get a lot better than this! Get out! 
"Hey OP, sorry you are going through this. As a 30-yr-old who had my share of disfunctional relationships as a teenager (we all did- don't feel bad about it), I would really encourage you to recognize this for what it is. This girl is spiteful, vengeful, and not a good person to stick with. If you try to work it out with her you will only end up heading into young adulthood thinking that this kind of behavior is not that bad, and can be worked through. It will desensitize you to it, and you will be all the more likely to gravitate towards these kinds of crazy-ass women. Stay away! Seriously. You obviously are on the right path by post here and considering it. But please, break up with her. This is the time of your life to learn what relationship red flags are."
"When someone tells you that they're crazy, you'd best believe it."
You teach others how to treat you. You should leave you are worth more than her.
"Didn‚Äôt even read the post, just the title. Leave her. You‚Äôre young and there‚Äôs a world out there full of people who don‚Äôt do shit like this. "
"Just read the title and you should dump her.

My ex did this, it only gets worse. There‚Äôs clearly something wrong with her emotionally and how she thinks relationships are supposed to work. You deserve better. Dump her and move on. 

I‚Äôll tell you what i wish someone had told me. You‚Äôre far too young to waste years of your life trying to fix someone who makes you miserable"
Please dear walk away from this. Your spirit of gifting is not appreciated by her. Most importantly YOU are not appreciated by her. You should never maintain a relationship where you must defend your behavior ahead of time particularly when you have done nothing to warrant the jealousy. You are young. Enjoy life and move on. She will quickly realize what she lost and you will quickly realize what you gained. 
Time to end it mate. Anyone who wants to hurt doesn‚Äôt also want to love you. 
"Regardless of age, her behavior is extremely immature. Then considering her age, this behavior makes more sense. My personal opinion is that she is trying to assert some sort of control over this relationship because she fears losing it. Which I think is the big universal problem the first time you fall in love. You couldnt imagine love before so you really can't imagine losing it. I'd talk to her about her behavior and set serious boundaries for your relationship and yourself. You dont need to tell her your boundaries and shouldn't. But if someone is being toxic you need to find your limit, plan how you will respond, and hold yourself to loving yourself at that standard. "
You guys are both young. You don't need to label her as abusive or manipulative or a bad partner. Just either tell her you need a break for some time (weeks?) Or break up.
I had a girlfriend destroy something I spent hours making her.  I ended up staying with her for about another year of misery before she finally left.  I think about that situation often and how I should have left her psychotic ass...don't make the same mistake I did and don't waste anymore time on someone like her.
No one needs this. She's not ready for a relationship. Don't look back. 
"OP, you're young, which is a blessing and a curse. A blessing because you have your life ahead of you with all the wonder of the world to come. Cursed because you lack insight due to your age, meaning you'll need to make mistakes in order to learn the harsh lessons.

Based on what you've said, especially considering it's a LDR, don't be surprised if she is cheating on you already. Take that into consideration on top of everything the good people here have mentioned already.

Maybe years from now you'll look back on this event and laugh at what transpired here. But that's only if you make the right decision which is to walk away from the LDR. Do the right thing.

All the best."
"When I was 16 I was the toxic girlfriend. I manipulated, cheated and hurt my first boyfriend. After all these years my advice to you is let her go and never look back because she will do it again and again. You deserve to be treated nice. People say that love is hard, but true love isn't hard, it is beautiful and easy and refreshing. You should be happy."
Break up with her she's gonna be way more abusive in the future
"My now-fiance and I were 1000 miles apart for nearly three years of our relationship. We had our obstacles, the distance being the main one. There were even long arguments over the phone or Skype. But it would've NEVER occurred to me to destroy something he'd made or bought for me. No matter how small the gift was, I kept and still treasure them all, because I love him and I'd never hurt him that way, no matter how angry I am. 

Anyone who destroys something you made for them just to crush you deserves no more of your time, thought, and especially not your love. End this. I believe it would only get worse from here. "
Oh that‚Äôs definitely a cause for a breakup. It shows who she is as a person and how your future with this girl will be so you have to decide if you want to be treated like that or if you want to be respected 
Send her a pic of you hooking up with someone on the holiday now 
"My heart aches for you. I‚Äôm sorry, but that kind of behavior is unacceptable. I would break things on a learn to recognize early signs of abusive partners. Best of luck and have a great time on your vacation!"
She deliberately hurt you. If that isn‚Äôt a dealbreaker then what would be? Get rid of her.
"Insecurity is very common when couples are young. Her concern that you will ‚Äúhook up‚Äù is a strong and clear indication of it (unless you have given her a reason, in which case the relationship is clearly not that important to you anyway). Her actions are abusive, but more that that, immature. Learn from this and move on. Insecurity is a relationship killer. It‚Äôs very hard to overcome and she must do it herself. You cannot ‚Äúreassure‚Äù it away. She simply becomes dependent on your reassurance while the insecurity remains. You will grow to resent this deeply. Run away before it gets harder. "
"You could be dating someone who lives close to you and absolutely treasures your gifts. Really, consider that for a moment."
"Honestly, I‚Äôd breaking up with her, she deliberately set out to hurt you, and even told you before hand that she was planning to do so, and now she is attempting to do some damage control now that she realizes that you actually walked out the door. Send a text or call stating that you do not want to be in a relationship with someone who tries to hurt you then boasts about how easy it is to do so just because of an argument, then leave it at that, you‚Äôre 17 and this is not a relationship you should be stuck in"
Leave her bud. Keep being you and the perfect girl will come along.
"If your considering it, that should give you a clue right there. And that was wrong for her to do that especially if she knows that you put your all into it. 

I also think 6 months going is not that long of time to know the person so I can understand why it has you off guard with what she did. 

If you did want to stay with her you tell her that it hurt you for her doing that. You put effort into it. Yes every couple argues but to intentionally do that that's very mean. 

I hope your able to make the best choice for yourself, and if it doesnt work out with her theres more options out there. "
"This is not a healthy relationship as she sounds really immature. Not only did she intentionally hurt you, but she doesn‚Äôt trust you to go on a trip with your family, she is calling you excessively, and overall sounds controlling/ smothering (ie. Needing to call you everyday when you‚Äôre on holiday/ picking fights with you essentially because you are traveling). Plus with the long distance it sounds exhausting. You‚Äôre young and sweet. Cut this one loose and end it. Don‚Äôt have goodbye sex because she sounds like the type to try and get preggo to keep you. "
"You leave her. She isnt capable of a healthy relationship right now. Shes toxically jealous and rather than trying to work issues out WITH you, shes attempting to actively hurt you. Thats not a quality partner. You're too young for this hot mess. Move on, man.b"
Destroying items is one of the precursors to abuse. BREAK UP WITH HER PLEASE.
She‚Äôs going to keep intentionally hurting you every time she‚Äôs upset. End it now and be done.
"Dude, just reading the title I can tell you to get out"
"I have been in this exact situation before. I actually just got out of the relationship too. The girl i [22,M] was dating in an LDR for 2 years would get so angry during our relatively normal arguments and one time she ripped up a large flowering plant that I bought her because she likes flowers so much. I cared about her a lot, but when you see irrational things like that happen, it's maybe time to move on. I did the opposite and just chalked it up to her having some problems that she was working on. But her insecurities and needs were not worth the things that we went through. I still care about her and pray that she gets through the things she's struggling with, but this is the same girl that raised her fist to me in an argument and hit me with a few things in another. Sorry to tell you man, but LDRs are hard no matter what, but when you visit the girl, it should be a wonderful time to enjoy eachothers long waited company, and if you feel like you've lost respect for her, it probably won't ever fully come back. Get you a girl who is tender enough to care in an argument, not one up you with pain. ""If I wanted to hurt you I would do this"" means she legitemately was out to crush your spirit and that my friend is not normal."
Done. That was like ripping you. 
"""How easily I can hurt you""

run"
"She did that knowing that it would hurt you, she even said that herself. You don‚Äôt need people like that in your life, you need and deserve someone who will cherish you and the things that you do. 

Sure arguments are normal and are part of a healthy relationship but not like this, if that‚Äôd happened to me I wouldn‚Äôt be able to forgive that. Not just because she‚Äôs destroyed a gift you have put time and love into but also because she destroyed it knowing that it‚Äôd hurt you. 

Take care of yourself and put yourself first. So many people won‚Äôt in this world. "
You‚Äôre 17. You can do way better than somebody who intentionally hurts your feelings. Probably someone a lot more local than she is as well. 
"She's insecure and more than a little crazy, you need to get off this wild ride before she further manipulates you"
"Totally agree this is break up worthy, your girl needs to grow up and/or have some therapy before she'll be able to be a good partner.  It is serious and should not be ignored.  Try not to be mad or upset, it is a gift when someone shows their true self.  "
"Here's a situation for you to compare: An employee walks into a co-worker's office. He puts down his report for the project on her desk, and she rips it up. Even if the report could be made again, she puts herself at a serious risk of being fired. It's disrespectful and it's cruel. Now back to your situation.

Intentionally hurting someone, even out of anger or frustration, is never acceptable. Because she jokingly mentioned it before, it was somewhat pre-planned and not a simple boil-over. This brings up a multitude of red flags. Just from this alone I know that she is:

\-Prone to argue

\-Thinks of ways to get back at someone 

\-Is capable of destroying other's work 

\-Has had previous 'events' as well

My advice to you would be:

Take some time to cool off, then contact her ( in person, or with a phone call, if you can). Let her know how she made you feel, how and why this has crossed a line for you, hear her out if she has anything to say, and then break up. "
You sound like a very sensitive and kind boy. Don't let any girl hurt you like that. Find one who deserves and appreciate every single attention you can give.
"I don't think I could stay with someone, who did or said things purposefully to hurt me, just to prove a point.
That they could.
Follow your gut it's usually right.. if this is something normal, I'd get out fast...."
You gotta move on. Keep those great ideas you have and make someone who deserves it happy.
Dump her insensitive ass and get yourself on the D Train to Bone Town my man. You're too young to have to put up with that shit.
The relationship seems toxic. Break up with her. Her insecurities are not your problem and she shouldn't try to control you. 
"The issues start with her thinking you're going to do something wrong when you are not with her. Your relationship is only 6 months old and you felt the need to make a list for her of ""acceptable and not acceptable"" behavior for you. You felt you needed you write down that you wouldn't cheat on her.  This seems very childish and tearing up a gift is a secondary issue. "
"The idea that she chooses to deliberately do something to hurt you isn't just a red flag, it's **THE RED FLAG**. Seriously, this is *exactly what abuse is*. If you stay with her after she does this, you tell her (and yourself) that her hurting you is an effective way of controlling you.

There is no way you can have a healthy relationship with someone who does this. All that's in store for you is misery. Even the love and affection she offers will come with the implicit condition that you don't do *anything* that might piss her off. Regardless of how innocent or benign your actions may be. 

Do both of yourselves a favor. Break up. Tell her that you will not be with someone who can deliberately do something just to hurt you. Maybe she'll take it to heart and be better to the next guy - but I doubt it.

"
"Honestly I think your feelings are valid. I would be pretty concerned if someone told me it would be easy to hurt me.

That is manipulative AF and also a huge red flag. 

You shouldn't want to hurt your partner in a relationship. Arguments are normal, but toying with emotions purposely are not. 

I think it's fair to be considering a break up. Especially since you two have only been dating 6 months. 

A partner who toys with the idea of purposely hurting you is a toxic partner. At your age it's not worth it to try and hash this out with her. I think your gut is trying to tell you something when you feel like you want to break up with her.

I say break up and enjoy your holiday! There are plenty of other girls out there who will actually be kind to your heart."
"She‚Äôs really young. This is just one reason lots of us parents try to get our kids to wait to date. You can make really awful decisions and hurt people you care about when you are still maturing. That sounds like more of a sibling fight than a mature relationship fight. When you are still maturing, you may have moments of extreme maturity, but are generally going to act your age, punctuated by some periods of behaving 5 or more years younger than you actually are. Keep that fruit on the tree until it‚Äôs ready to be picked. Everyone will be healthier and happier in the long run when you are allowed to grow up slowly, rather than taking on adult roles nearly half a decade before being an adult, "
"Do her a favor and demonstrate that her manipulative and sadistic interpersonal strategy is not going to ever get the result she wants. Maybe she‚Äôll make a better decision sometime in the future... with someone else. You sound wonderful, find someone who knows how to love you and care about your feelings even if you are in an argument."
"She sounds very toxic. Trust me, it will only get worse. "
"Everything you've described, from her trust issues to the way she treated your gift, is a massive deal. Break up with her immediately, block her number, and never look back. That's not love at all, and it's not something worth being worked out."
damn i would leave no matter what reading your post hit me in the feels and i'm furious as well thats super evil if she reacts like this when a argument is presented 
"Leave her. If she‚Äôs doing this at 6 months then it will only get worse. This is a HUGE red flag. She‚Äôs manipulative and clingy. You don‚Äôt want to exhaust yourself emotionally just to see her, you should be happy not stressing. No partner should ever break something you made just to hurt you. "
"You're too young and too kind to let this person be in your life. Move on and put it down to experience. What a lovely thing you did though, handmade gifts are the best!! "
"Dude you sound like a great guy, I aim to be like you one day. Honestly, she went out of her way to hurt you. This is manipulative as fuck. It‚Äôs like she‚Äôs saying, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt test me or I‚Äôll make sure you regret it.‚Äù She‚Äôs not worth your time. Either she changes or you dump her and move on. Preferably the latter."
This breaks my heart. My boyfriend made me a drawing with some song lyrics for valentines day when we were long distance and I cherish it. Never even in the worst fight I can imagine would I tear it up. 
"lmfao this is just teen angst. All teen girls are crazy, I didn't come mature until I turned 21 (still not sure if I'm THAT mature). "
You guys sound really young. I don‚Äôt think this is something to break up over but you need to have a serious talk and let her know how this made you feel. 
"I didn't read the text, but from the title alone, get out. Run. As fast as you can. "
"People argue in relationships sometimes but it sounds like she's malicious and she purposefully aimed where she knew it would hurt the most. You're too young to be wasting your time with someone like that. There are a ton of girls that would absolutely love to get those little handmade gifts from you and would cherish them. Break up with her and move on would be my advice. Don't ghost her because she'll go crazy and continue to text and call. Let her know that the relationship is toxic, and you cannot be with someone that tries actively to hurt you. Then block her and go enjoy your vacation! "
"Get out while you can. And enjoy your vacation. If you make up, she will destroy your vacation. "
"This is a form of violence. 
You don't want to be with someone that use any form of violence, being against yourself or others.

But your story relates only one mistake from her. Don't something once is fine. It's a mistake. The bigger the mistake, the bigger the lesson for the rest of life.

Recurrent violent behavior is to be avoided at all cost. But you're both young and way less mature than your future selves will be. Consider this as well when taking your decision.

But again, violence is hard to excuse. If she repeats it, you don't want someone like that in your life at all"
You deserve better. You‚Äôre so young and have so much time ahead of you that this is a minor roadblock. Use it as some motivation as well... that‚Äôs what I always did. Stay tough brother. Take care of yourself. 
"Intentional cruelty is not only incredibly WRONG in any relationship, it is psychologically abusive. And this girl sounds toxic. Her insecurity, inability to trust, & willingness to do something specifically for the reason of hurting you is NOT HEALTHY.

RUN! RUN FAST! RUN FAR! & don't go back. 
You are 17. I still remember how much & how hard I loved at 17. But you are also learning about real adult relationships now. If what you learn is unhealthy, chances are, a lot of your future relationships will be unhealthy also, because you will learn unhealthy patterns & coping mechanisms. If you want a healthy, loving relationship, you must cultivate it with someone healthy & refuse to allow anyone to treat you poorly, NO matter how much they say they love you. 
Remember, you are not responsible for anyone's feelings but your own. No one can MAKE you happy. You can't MAKE anyone else happy either. You can bring joy to someone's life though.
Let her deal with her insecurities. It is not your place to fix them, or coddle her to avoid dealing with them. Any real, lasting, positive change for her- or you- must come from within....
"
"Ditch her. Run, don't walk away. 
- A strong, happy adult male who has successful, happy relationship"
"LDRs don't work if you can't trust each other implicitly. My SO and I were long distance for more than 4 years and we never felt the need to reassure each other that we ""wouldn't hook up"" with people when we were on a trip. We had one good discussion about how much cheating would hurt both of us and we both understood that that could never happen. 

Empathy, trust, and communication are the keys to a successful LDR. It seems like your SO is lacking all three. "
"You ‚Äúproceed‚Äù by walking away from her and not looking back.  Much more, and worse, versions of this behavior lies ahead for you if you stay with her.
Anyone who purposely hurts you is not someone you want to be with, period. "
she sounds really immature to go out of her way to hurt you like that. i personally would break up with her. that behavior isn't normal and shows you she isn't capable of handling arguments/conversations well at all. the fact you didn't even care about leaving her should also show you something.
[removed]
"Look, she has some serious issues.  Pre-meditated thoughts to hurt someone and then executing intentionally to inflict pain is as bad as it gets.

Now if these were the worst 2 days of her life, I might let it go.  If this is a pattern and she doesn‚Äôt try to make it right, end it.

‚ÄúWhen someone shows you who they are, believe them‚Äù."
"Get out bro, if she‚Äôs capable of that she‚Äôs capable of more. You sound like a good guy. You don‚Äôt deserve that shit."
"There are so many hints of her trying to control you in your text I don't even know where to start.

If that hits home, this is probable not the kind of person you want in a relationship. Good relationships last because people are free to leave and they decide they want to continue walking together. There should be no hard ties and promises."
"When you argue with someone it‚Äôs usually because you disagree. You shouldn‚Äôt stop loving them and want to hurt them during the argument, or you shouldn‚Äôt be together. If she gets angry she may try and succeed hurting you again. You probably shouldn‚Äôt be with someone who has no problems and actively tries to hurt you. "
"From your other comments she is pushing her insecurities onto you even though there is no real basis to do so.

Dump her, tell her to grow up and then block her from everything. Tell your family to block her and enjoy your holiday."
"GTFO and burn that bridge to the fucking ground, stomp it further into the ground with your heel, then light it on fire again for good measure."
"Jealous, petty, cruel, vindictive, immature...

Only thing she needs to add to this list is ‚Äúsingle‚Äù 

I think you should do her that favor, my friend "
"It's been 6months.... end this trainwreck of a relationship

Also you seem pretty inexperienced with relationships so know that a woman demanding you to not hook up with someone while on the train aka anyone that can't trust you to be alone without needing ""reassurances"" is engaging in controlling, unhealthy, and emotionally abusive behavior. "
"Only you can determine whether there‚Äôs anything worth salvaging. If you do decide to stay with her, make sure she knows how terribly she hurt you. "
You're young. That is some serious red flag. Get out now!
"You're not overreacting, I would have felt crushed too. Don't be with someone who intentionally hurts you. Don't date someone who, instead of trying to resolve the conflict, looks for ways to lash out at you. You're making the right choice by ending the relationship. "
"End it. She sounds like a cruel and manipulative person, and you are way too young to have your love map fucked up. "
"Ugh I‚Äôm sorry, but anyone that sends that many texts should be broken up with. Sounds extremely obsessive and manipulative. Now that you‚Äôve left, she doesn‚Äôt even care about your feelings, her only thought is probably her fear that you‚Äôll leave her, not that she hurt you ripping something thoughtful up. 6 months in and she‚Äôs already freaking out that you‚Äôll cheat on her? I don‚Äôt know how old you are, my friend, but that‚Äôs a textbook definition of a break up call. Do it now and do it fast and never look back. "
"She doesn't trust you enough to go on vacation with family and not cheat. 

If you don't have trust, you don't have anything in a relationship. She's not worth the effort if she can't try to trust you. "
"Throw this one back.  Lots of far more mentally healthy fish in the sea.  Seriously, don‚Äôt hesitate.  You definitely can do better. "
"Pretty sure there's a chick out there that would appreciate said gifts. You're young, drop her and move on."
"The next step seems obvious to me... say bye and don't look back. It'll only get worse from here, and it sounds like it's already been a rough ride"
Then when you hurt her down the road 'to get revenge' she takes a hammer to your car. 
"There are so many good fish out there in the sea. It takes patience, but a good catch is well worth it. "
"Guys I feel like your getting too mad, I mean I know she broke a gift he worked really hard on but she was really angry and when your angry you stop caring about consequences. Also she tried calling and texting him most likely because she was apologizing, and I feel like he should accept her appology "
"If that's not a good enough reason to leave, then what is? Cut your losses and be glad you only burned 6 months."
"Sometimes young people want to make sure that they have an effect, that they can make something happen. She pushed a boundary to see what she can do and you have 80 texts and 8 missed calls of her feeling atrocious about what she did. 

The gift can be replaced. If she's really remorseful, tell her how much it hurt and take her back. "
"‚ÄúHow easily I can hurt you‚Äù that kind of sounds like a threat to me, even if she is not talking about physical pain. Psychological and emotional abuse is real. She is abusing your feelings in order to cause you pain and show her power. 

Not good "
I read the title. I did not read post. Break up. Break up yesterday. Time travel into the past and avoid meeting her.
"Game over man. Have some respect for yourself. You don't deserve to be treated like that. That is awful. She doesn't deserve someone like you, kick her to the curb. Especially since it's LDR, honestly what kind of benefit are you getting out of the relationship at this point? Fire her ass, there are so many better options out there for you."
"You‚Äôre 17, you‚Äôve only been dating for 6 months and she‚Äôs already a nightmare! Get rid of her. She doesn‚Äôt trust you, doesn‚Äôt respect you and frankly she sounds cruel, manipulative and controlling. 
Block her on your phone and social media, enjoy your holiday with your family and use that as a good time to start moving on. "
"Simply put, she is an asshole. Don't waste your time with her. It is only 6 months in and she is being like this. It won't get better."
"Run...do not walk to the next relationship.  Someone who would purposely hurt you is Toxic. Just say ""next""."
"Without knowing anything outside this situation, I'd have to say I think you should try to patch things up. Explain to her how you feel and the effects of her actions, all that jazz. If you can get past this, you'll be stronger for it."
" You are 17, unmarried, no kids, and in a long distance relationship with someone who intentionally hurts you. This is the easiest breakup ever. "
"80 texts? And why exactly are you still communicating with this person (I can't even describe her as a girlfriend) that you argue with constantly?

Jesus, fucking, run. Far and fast. This is not what a relationship should be. Ever."
"Yeahh 100% break up. 6 months is too early to show your crazy, she's extra crazy."
"Dude you're 17, appreciate and reflect on this this as the learning experience it is and enjoy the bright new opportunities ahead of you!"
"Good on you for deciding to break up. She's not mature enough obviously and you can do better, and you're still young."
"All I did was read the first few sentences and I can tell you as someone who‚Äôs been there before, you‚Äôre dealing with a Class A narcissist. 

Get out. NO ONE who hurts you to get a reaction loves you. "
"Please be done with her, she'll ruin you. "
"Don't proceed at all. Seriously, just walk away and let her sulk in the fact she ruined a relationship by tearing apart what you made for her. If she is this immature, it'd be much better to just leave it."
Have you cheated before? Was this what the argument was about? 
"I think the comments here have done well at articulating the issues, but I'd like to highlight the point you made about talking on the phone for at least 1 hour a day. I have always found it extremely important to me to have space to be my own person within a relationship. Calling for one hour a day is great if you want to, but being obligated to seems unhealthy. A quick 5 to 10 minute goodnight call might be nice, but sometimes it's nice to have space to yourself every now and again, *especially* if you're young. 

I know that everyone has different needs and everything, but I think it's worth considering. Good luck with this and future relationships!"
"You didn't deserve that OP.

Please let us know how it goes.

Remindme! 1 day"
This is beyond toxic. Break up with her and cut her out of your life. She does not respect you. 
"You mentioned that you were going on holiday with your family, well time to have some real fun on that holiday! If you didn‚Äôt understand the hint, I can lay it out for you... hookup with someone on your holiday. Forget this girl! A little ghosting is in order. You sound like a really sweet guy, you deserve someone that appreciates what you have to offer. "
"I just left an LDR who was exactly like this. He would purposefully tell me he will tear things, he‚Äôs torn things like photos and letters on skype or facetime.

Then he needed me to report my life to him, EVERY HOUR on the dot. 

Remember that a person who claims to love you, will NEVER purposefully hurt you.

Get out and find a girl who will not treat you this way. You deserve better"
Please end it but don't think she's going to go quietly and peacefully. 
"The fact that she wants to hurt you at all is a HUGE red flag.

Even when my husband and I are arguing, we still love each other (he‚Äôs even told me that he avoids looking at me when he‚Äôs angry with me because seeing my face makes him want to smile, lol), and don‚Äôt want the other to feel pain. "
"Dude, sounds pretty crazy to me.  There is no way to heal the scars she intends to leave on your psyche."
"Listen, you seem like a really great guy. I often see people on this sub jumping the gun and telling others to make major life choices, like breaking up with your significant other, for no good reason. I hope you understand this is not one of those times, believe people when they say get the hell away from this girl. It seems to me like you really care about her and her feelings, and she does not care about yours. The more comfortable she gets in your relationship and with you, the more she will take advantage of your kind heart and bleed you dry. Best of luck to you, i hope everything works out in your favor "
"She's a psycho break up with her, honestly just do it through text she doesn't even deserve a phone call. Then block her number."
"You break up with her. That's not normal, and is an unacceptable way to treat any other human, especially your SO. Break up with her so she learns that lesson. Otherwise, she will continue to do this crap to you and others."
"You do not intentionally hurt someone you love.

There is such a monumental difference between doing and saying something in the heat of the moment and making a calculated plan with the sole intention of hurting someone.  What she did was the latter.  Please don't allow someone like this to abuse you.  The right person will appreciate the things you do and make for them, and won't think about ways to harm you. "
"Out. Out. Get out. Danger, Will Robinson!"
"That is so sad. I've always cherished any handmade gifts my husband makes for me, and I would be devastated if any of them were damaged. I wouldn't stay with her if I were you. 

That being said, go easy on her. She's 14 and it's probably her first relationship. "
"She sounds immature, dump her"
"Immature. Childish. Toxic. Having disagreements is normal, but this is just her trying to have the ""upper hand"" here, sounds like she's more interesting in *winning* than mutual zero ground. Break up. "
"She‚Äôs young and immature. Sadly i remember being that girl. :/ 
She will only hurt you in the long wrong. 
Leave now before you start to actually hate her. ( because trust me that is how it‚Äôs going to end ) and it‚Äôs horrible hating someone especially so young too. 
She has to learn that this isn‚Äôt okay. And unfortunately for you, you were meant to  be lesson for her. And she‚Äôll learn the hard way, that you can‚Äôt treat people that way "
">Trying to figure out if this is the last straw for me or not.

Yes, this is the last straw.  If you put up with this, you're just asking for more down the road."
"From your update, I see you're already taking the right path."
Dude. Enjoy your upcoming adulthood & drop that  toxic p.o.s.
Run away. Like now. You shouldn't even need to make a list of what you're not going to do on your family trip. It should be a given between you two
"You are young and need to just walk away from this relationship. Her behavior was manipulative and purposefully used to cause you pain emotionally and psychologically. This is not something people do once and then never do again. She‚Äôll do it over and over unless she does some real soul searching and finds a shrink. You‚Äôre too young to tie yourself down to this kind of emotional/psychological baggage. Plus, if there is no trust on her end and she is always insecure, you‚Äôre never going to hear the end of this argument. Run, run away. Go have fun with life and eventually you‚Äôll find a kind and confident person you respect, and who respects you. "
I mean your dating a 14 year old... what do you expect.
Long distance relationship... nope. Intentionally hurts you... nope. She doesn't seem to trust you... nope. You're already having doubts from previous events... GTFO. Should be a pretty easy decision. 
"That‚Äôs easy, break up w/her. 

This is just the tip of her toxic iceberg. You don‚Äôt need or deserve that bullshit. "
Be logical. Breakup with her.
Hit the road boss. Better days ahead.
"Howmany times in one morning am I going to see an example of my ex's behaviour? Seriously other poster was right, good to learn what toxic looks like while you're younger, it'll save you time, mental health, and your heart in the future. "
"She's emotionally abusive. Dump her. 
Also, six months and already having these kinds of issues ? "
Toxic as fuck. It‚Äôs worth wondering whether she really wanted the LDR and isn‚Äôt screwing someone else and wants to make it easier for you to finish it as she doesn‚Äôt have the balls to. (Pardon the pun) 
"I'm my experience, when someone is that paranoid that you'll do something to hurt them, they've typically engaged (or are currently engaging) in those hurtful activities themselves. But that's besides the point. It doesn't matter what type of relationship you have, or how serious you think it is, if a basic, non-argumentative level of communication can't be reached and maintained, it's not a relationship worth having. "
"She sounds manipulative, self centred and mean. Do avoid "
"I‚Äôm sorry but I think the writing is on the wall here. She sounds cruel, selfish, and immature. I‚Äôm not sure how old you guys are, but the insecurities and malicious desire to ‚Äúhurt‚Äùyou shows her to be a very toxic person. Run while you still can. Trust me on this one. Been there. Good luck. "
Break up. She‚Äôs wacko 
This is abuse. Please leave this person immediately.
"She weaponized a gift and seeks to hurt you as an expression of her own insecurities. I'm not her therapist and I won't ask where she gained these toxic, maladaptive tendencies, but she definitely has them and she showed you in one single moment exactly who she really is. This generally always goes the same way. She was testing to see how much she can control you with guilt and acts of intentional emotional harm.  


You should leave her, but be completely ready for the torrent of emotional outbursts and crying and \_bargaining\_ and promises she'll be better and she's so sorry and other things that will give you emotional whiplash. The pattern is well understood. Just text her and say she hurt you, and you know that was her intent, and it's over because of that. Don't get stuck in negotiations over if it's actually over.  
"
"There‚Äôs more to the story. They were arguing about something he did in the past. It was glossed over because he wanted to marginalize it. OP, what happened? ;)"
"Wait a second. I've done things like that... and I don't consider myself a bad or toxic person. My partner has accepted that we all have overly dramatic moments. And writing to someone ""I'm not going to hook up"" is playing with their self esteem. It could be cute at first, but I would probably react like her... because the statement joke or not is fixating on a problem in the relationship. The girl wrote you 80 messages. Call her... it was just a gift... she is a person... maybe your girlfriend...maybe your future wife. We are all human and we all make mistakes. "
Mmmmmm...no dude. She seems petty and vengeful. Let this one go. She's not really worth your time.
"Your girlfriend is abusive and likely mentally ill (Google bipolar disorder or borderline personality disorder and see if they ring any bells).

She is using you as an emotional punch bag. These are actual problems that you are having, it is your girlfriend finding reasons to take out *her* anger on you.

Think back to the arguments. Did you actually do anything wrong? Or is she just angry and looking for someone to punish?

Don't waste any more of your time on this abusive person."
"How is your relationship going otherwise? How big was the thing you were arguing about?
"
"In my opinion, I think you should mend this rather than break up.

What she did wasn‚Äôt right, not at all. But some girls (guys too) do this, they get extremely angry and do something to get the argument flowing in their favor. Or to just end it all (the argument) right then and there. 

I don‚Äôt really know what you were both arguing about because you didn‚Äôt give us context on that, so I can‚Äôt attack or defend any side on the topic of previous arguments.

Tell her, that if she does something like this again, you‚Äôre done. You are obviously furious for her breaking your handmade gifts, as you put in lots of effort into them. 

I would assume she understands now that that really really seemed to hurt you, (the loads of calls and messages) I hope that she comes to realize what goes through you emotionally, and that it won‚Äôt happen again. 

On your trip with your family, recuperate from the argument and just give yourself time to think about what sparked the argument(s) and how you could fix the argument sparks next time. Talk to her on the trip and hopefully all should be well.

Be sure to find time to meet with her after your trip, your place might seem like the better option this time. 

But if she keeps up the pettiness and toxicity of constantly arguing and breaking gifts over pointless arguments, break up immediately.

tl;dr: 
Give it another shot, because she should have realized all the pain she had caused at this point. Talk to her on your trip and attempt to mend things, think about how to prevent future arguments, with her or any person. Unless you did something wrong in the unspecified arguments, not much of this should have been your fault. If she continues the arguments and breaking gifts, break up.

Sorry if this was a long read, hope it helps. Cheers!"
"Seriously. Fighting is normal, purposefully hurting another during a fight is not. (The fight becomes about one upping rather than the matter at hand.) I would have broken up with her yesterday. That kind of behaviour is unacceptable.

Also, her insecurities are not your responsibility. Trust is essential to a healthy relationship."
"> A person who purposely aims to hurt you is not a person you should allow in your life for any amount of time.   

Yup, that's the only answer you need.  </thread>  

The only circumstances under which you should even consider staying with her, IMHO, are if she completely learns her lesson and not just promises but *understands* that this is NOT how couples treat each other, for ANY reason.  I doubt very much she will truly figure that out (although I'm sure she will say she does in order to get you to stay).  

"
"^^ That's literally the best advice your going to get. Anyone who tries to hurt you isn't worth your time or energy. Don't let her get away with this, drop this relationship and find yourself a girl who will treat you with respect or just hookup and have fun. Your young. It's going to get nasty if you ever move in together. She'll find new reasons to rip you down and hurt you over time. "
"> End it and have a fabulous time on your holiday.

Yes, you're very very young and have a full life ahead of you.  Consider this a learning experiance and find a nice girl who isn't long distance from you to date."
"Not only this, but OP has to reassure her he won't do anything ""bad"" while on a family trip? Can anyone say controlling and insecure af?"
"F this B, dude, you‚Äôre young, RUN away and find another one that will respect you"
Agreed. But no one should put up with emotional manipulation like this
"it doesn't matter what a persons age is no one is ""old enough"" to be in a toxic relationship"
">You're too young to continue this toxic relationship with your girlfriend.


I really don't see how age matters here.

Noone should have to deal with something like this."
"That was my first thought too, but they're 17, so I think it's best to give them a break. I did all sorts of cringey shit when I was figuring out what a relationship is."
"Her previous boyfriend cheated on her 5 times, she's very paranoid about this topic. Despite that, I've never shown any signs of a possible infidelty so this is kinda annoying to hear every single time."
">‚ÄúI put rules on it to show how I‚Äôll behave on holiday.‚Äù

I feel like some of this might have to do with the fact that they‚Äôre 17. But yeah this is the kind of thing you mature and move on from eventually. 

Edit: apparently she's actually 14 which should take our expectations of both of them even lower. These early relationships are essential for learning to filter out the crazy (in ourselves and others) in the future."
Seriously this girl sounds like an actual sociopath. As if she was pleased with herself for thinking of a really hurtful thing she could do to OP and then created an opportunity to do it.
"Yeah, I'm definitely ok.

Basically we fought about the fact that we had a rough patch a while ago that ended with me asking a classmate for advice. Said clasmmate happened to be her enemy for life and she was damn pissed."
"I agree.  A gift that is homemade is the most precious kind of gift.  Even if it's something that's put together quickly or cheaply, so long as effort and love is put in, it's a unique treasure.  The idea of somebody I cared for destroying a homemade gift makes my stomach turn.

The gifts you have given her are special, and if she won't respect them, she won't respect you.  There is absolutely somebody out there who will treasure the fruits of your time and dedication, but it's clearly not her."
"I noticed that too!

Although in Italy apparently this relationship is legal, this is basically the issue, she is literally a kid."
Yeah..that‚Äôs kinda creepy 
"This, listen to this, OP! "
This post should be higher up because this is great advice. 
Wow I actually love your marriage already. And yes. This. Listen to all of this.
"I know all of this.

I was the one to never question what she does, because from what she said I understood I could trust her 100&#37;.

It's her that can't trust me the same. I have never cheated. I have said lies sometimes but promptly apologized, and none of them had to do with infidelty.

Her ex cheated on her with 5 different guys. I think that might be the main reason, but I'm not sure"
">  Anyone who says out of their actual face that they want to hurt you when they're mad does NOT love you. Love does not include deliberately hurting your person.

What if a parents says this when fighting with their child?(and by 'child' I mean teen and young adult...)

"
I wish I will.
"Of course she is immature, she is 14!"
Why is a 17 year old with a 14 year old? How did you find that out? A 14 year old doesn‚Äôt know what a good relationship is! Lol 
Just for the record. The girl is 14. He needs to stop dating children if he doesn't want to deal with childish behavior.
People on this sub love to immediately label everyone as emotional abusive and toxic. The girl is 14. She is being a teenager.
"I tried, she called my sister, mother, and my two best friends. I think I'll call her back tomorrow to decide for once what to do"
Well said. Only good vibes is what you should keep around you. 
Even Disco Stun wants you to be comfortable while he does his thing. 
"He needs to learn to not date children. Shes only 14, it's no surprise shes acting childish."
"She's 14. In a few years, she will be the age of your daughter...

OP really should have put her age in the post. "
"And if my daughter was 14 years old like OP‚Äôs girlfriend is and a 17 year old showed interest in her, I‚Äôd probably kick his arse. So."
"I definitely know this is not normal at all, I remind her all the time."
Co-signed. Practice self-care and self-respect and don't put up with crap from people OP. You'll find someone who is kinder to you.
"Well, shes also only 14"
Maybe that's because shes a 14 year old child.
"She‚Äôs 14, so she literally is a child. OP needs to stop dating children."
"Bingo! This is the correct answer. She is projecting so hard to hide her own actions. Classic psychology 101. I hope OP learns this quickly.

Let me guess... She also can only make friends with guys because ""girls are too much drama""... lol smh. "
Definitely not
"She has no trust for a lot of reasons, few of which have actually something to do with me. It's annoying anyway"
[removed]
"Oh also, you sound like a GREAT boyfriend. For being 17 years old, if you constantly consider bringing her a hand made gift every time you see her... wow. That's awesome. But have someone who is thankful for those things. Keep being a fantastic example of a good boyfriend (as long as you're not actually trying to hook up with other girls) and find a good girl to match."
"Of course she's immature, she's 14(!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) years old."
She‚Äôs not mature enough because she‚Äôs 14 years old and is probably still trying to wrap her head around menstruation. OP didn‚Äôt mention that.
"What OP neglected to mention is that she‚Äôs 14 years old. A child, with the emotional maturity of a child. OP didn‚Äôt want people to know that, though."
"She's 14...

They've always been LDR. "
"Or they are a 14 year old girl in the midst of hormonal changes during puberty. 

OP needs to date someone his own age, and he needs to be truthful in his post rather than paint his gf as a crazy, possessive psycho, when she is just a childish 14 year old who clearly isn't ready for a relationship, especially with a 17 year old. "
"He's 17 (says in his post).

She's 14 (said in another post). "
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôd say to his 14 year old ‚Äúgirlfriend‚Äù as well.
Does it matter? She's controlling and intentionally hurtful. It would be foolish of OP to do anything but dump her. 
"Yes this exactly. Fighting is you two vs. the problem, not you vs. her."
"Amen brother, i was gonna away the same thing.  "
"Definitely! To piggyback off of this - reassurance is pretty much always a good thing. But when you have to constantly justify your actions to appease the other persons insecurities, it becomes something else."
"From my personal experience, people like her never learn. She showed who she is. This will happen again. Right circumstance will bring it out again."
She sounds immature. Move on
that is exactly what they are saying to do...
"I mean, it's the perfect way to teach this girl if you act to deliberately hurt someone, don't expect a good outcome."
"He sounds slightly more mature than her though, so I think he‚Äôd be better off in a relationship with someone of a more similar maturity level. There will still be plenty of cringe, but hopefully not *unhealthy* cringe.

I agree tho‚Äîhe is young, and I shouldn‚Äôt fault *him* so much, I just want him to see that it can be better. "
His girlfriend is actually 14 which makes way more sense. 
"In a previous post that's been deleted, he said that she was 14. I believe that she's a child in the eyes of the law."
"I disagree about giving them a break. Abusive relationships should not be tolerated at any age. Being a teen doesn't make this okay. Maybe it is just youth, but she has issues that her parent, and possibly a therapist needs to deal with, not him. "
"That was my thought as well. I knew from the first sentence that he was going to get all sorts of advice ignoring the fact that they‚Äôre teens in an LDR. Is this relationship unhealthy? Yes. Is this supremely abnormal behavior and a sign that his gf is evil and manipulative? Nah. She‚Äôs 17. In a few years she‚Äôll probably look back and be ashamed of many of the things she did at 17. 

EDIT: Oh she‚Äôs 14. That changes this all even more. "
I still cringe thinking back to me at 17 and in a first (serious) relationship 
"How old is your girlfriend? This could be important to know where she is coming from. A 17 year old girl that has been cheated on 5 times is slightly different than a 21 year old girl that has been cheated on 5 times. Still, not pleasant, but it can go to see her maturity. "
You should text her ‚Äú You no longer need to worry about me cheating because we are done‚Äù
"She‚Äôs lashing out coz she‚Äôs hurt and she‚Äôs seeing how far she can push you with these constant arguments and doing things to purposely hurt you. This is not to say stay with her. She needs a wake up call that this is the total opposite if ok and that hers and other people‚Äôs feelings matter. I would break up and advise her to get some therapy to deal with the emotional shitstorm she seems to have in her head. Help her by leaving, respect yourself by leaving. Who knows where you‚Äôll both be in the future but right now it ain‚Äôt working"
"You are not responsable for what his previous boyfriend did. She should not be able to make that a point of contention in your relationship. 

Of course you can step up, if you want. Have a serious conversation and make it clear that this kind of behaviour has to stop. She's wrong, but nobody is perfect, and she may (MAY) get better. Or just bail."
"Mate just because she had bad experiences with cheating it doesn't mean she has to take her insecurities out on you. She was already setting rules for you (at least one hour on the phone everyday?) to ""behave"". If it's still such a problem for her then she should be single until she figures it out. 

But most importantly, breaking up is the best thing you can do for yourself right now, because by staying you'll be showing her that she can push your limits and there'll be no consequences. When we tell you that you're too young and you'll be fine, we do mean it. "
"It‚Äôs the age thing as well as the cheating. It‚Äôs why age gap relationships at these ages tend to not work out. You may as well be 22 for the likely difference in maturity etc.

I‚Äôm gonna assume you guys are maybe close in school years or something (she‚Äôs a very young freshman and you‚Äôre an old junior or something) but ... yeah, she‚Äôs in the wrong at any age but it‚Äôs more explained at 14, look for someone closer in maturity to you"
"Based on OP:s post history, the girl is 14. I think expecting emotional maturity is a bit of a tall order here."
"It also sounds like he has hooked up in the past, which caused her to be distrustful. "
"Oh my god, she's fourteen."
"Eh, she sounds like a pretty typical teenage girl these days."
">As if she was pleased with herself for thinking of a really hurtful thing she could do to OP and then created an opportunity to do it.

Well I see that my father has been teaching other people his skills."
[deleted]
At 17 I‚Äôd just say goodbye. It isn‚Äôt worth it at this point. This behavior will NOT get any better. I‚Äôm sorry you are already dealing with this kind of situation :(

>enemy for life

If I know anything, and I don't, they'll be best friends in 6 months.

Get out while you can, my dude. "
"Oh to be 17 again...  I'm not patronizing you, and I'm sorry you're going through this, but you'll look back on her behavior (and maybe some of your own) and laugh about it in a few years.  When i was your age I had a girl text me that she was in the hospital because she was so upset that i didn't reply to her text the night before that she stole her dad's truck and crashed it.  It obviously didn't happen and was easy to prove she was lying.  But either way, someone that is attempting to manipulate you isn't worth your time.  

You'd be doing both yourself and her a favor by literally just cutting contact with her, sorry that sucks but it's what you both need.  She needs to learn to treat people with respect and she's not going to do it unless you put your foot down.  

You're a nice person because you care about her, but some people will abuse your affection to them in order to assert power over you in an unhealthy way.  Ask yourself, ""would I be as forgiving of my sibling or friend if they had done the same thing?"" Just because someone is your girlfriend doesn't mean that they get to make your decisions or control what you do more than anyone else.  You shouldn't need to accommodate for someone's crazy, they'll get used to acting respectfully if you don't bend to their antics.  You guys are young so it's not like she won't be fine in a couple years, but trust me, these sorts of things happen less and less as you get a bit older because people mature and better understand how to respect others.  I know the age thing isn't what anyone wants to hear, but it's true.

"
"You're a teenager, so expect teenage drama in your life, but you need to learn to just move on from it. Don't play into it. "
"My bf made me a really bad doodle on a paper towel a few years ago when I was going through a rough patch and I still have it. It wouldn't ever cross my mind to tear it up, especially not to hurt him. "
"Yeah, a little weirded out by a 17 year old and a 14 year old meeting while ‚Äúhooking up‚Äù on a vacation. Yikes. "
"Yep, pretty common in Italy for 14/15 year old girls to find boyfriends around 18. Or, if not common, at least not weird at all."
"My ex boyfriend told me the same thing, that his ex before me cheated on him with 5 different guys as well. And then he projected all his trust issues onto our relationship and began trying to slowly damage my perception of myself towards my friends, deliberately trying to sever my friendships so I would be dependent on him, he would make me promise that I ""wouldn't do anything stupid"" if I was going to be drinking or smoking, and no matter how often I would say ""I'll be with my friends and I'll message you when I have a chance"", he would become angry and start an argument with me for not texting him every second. And this was only regarding my friendships/time to myself, not even mentioning that he'd make comments about how I spent my money (we didn't even live together), or how I'd dress or do my hair, often would tell me ""don't wear such and such to this thing"" or whatever. And it started very much the same as yours. No matter the source of her trust issues, she's a disaster and you should run as far away from this girl as possible. "
Then they‚Äôre a shitty parent 
"Well, I have a child, a very difficult teenage girl. She drives me up the wall. But I would never, ever, ever say something that I thought would hurt her, unless it was a truth she needed to hear. It is not in me to say ""you're stupid"" or something like that, because she's my child. I'd burn the world down for her, even though I'd like to shake her like a polaroid picture sometimes. "
"My strategy was always to look at what I learned from the relationship.
It hurts, but it's an amazing learning experience. Remind yourself that this experience will ensure that you're unlikely to choose another partner who brings her trust issues to the table instead of dealing with them. We all have issues, but as adults we must deal with it, or it will ruin us.
You also now know what it's like to have someone disrespect you by tearing up gifts, so you'll likely avoid that in the future. You're slowly figuring or what you like in a partner and one day you will meet someone with the same critiria as you you.

This is good.

Edit :spelling"
I must have missed that in the op. My bad.
"I looked at his history. He posted 5 months ago about a 14 year old girl he was dating, and he said in this post they have been dating for 6 months."
[removed]
"You should tell your family what happened so she doesn't conjure up some lie to make you seem like the bad guy (Also, tell them to block her too). I feel like this 14 y/o child would try and hurt you somehow because you hurt her by breaking up. Best to cover your ass when it comes to crazy."
"She sounds like a real catch.  /s.  

What is there left to decide?  She‚Äôs clearly a lunatic. "
How is that relevant in the slightest? All that means is that she is going to be doing worse shit as she grows like drowning puppies. That or simply get better at hiding it. Psychopaths are super good at hiding that shit.
"I didn‚Äôt see it mention her age anywhere! Also I honestly don‚Äôt see the problem with him dating a 14 year old honestly. That would mean she was a freshman when he was a senior and there are worse things than that. That‚Äôs just my personal opinion though. However yes, this behavior is to be expected of a 14 year old and OP needs to understand that dating someone younger than you, especially at that age, is a world of differences and immaturity and growth."
"Or you know, shes 14."
I‚Äôm gonna say this is worthy of a breakup either way pal
Yeah this is such bullshit.
"Yeah, you're probably right. "
"Even if you two are fighting and dislike each other in the moment, you shouldn't be dating someone who takes that to mean that they hate you and want to hurt you because you are fighting."
"Compromise is important in healthy relationship, she probably equates compromise to losing."
"In general, I agree.  

Only reason I leave that possibility open is because she's 17.  She's probably never been in a serious relationship before this one.  So it's possible she's never learned that actions like this have consequences.  

OP said she's blowing up his phone- I think the answer lies in the contents of those messages.  If she's genuinely apologetic and is begging for a 2nd chance, then maybe she learned something.  If she's angry, then not so much.  "
">people like her never learn

I think that's a reasonable thing to say if she were 5 or 10 years older, but she's a child. I think a lot of people who acted like this as teens do learn why it's not acceptable. OP should break up with her, because he doesn't deserve to be treated in such a cruel manner, but it's likely that losing this relation will be a step towards her learning and growing to be a more thoughtful person. "
"Well yeah, she is fourteen apparently."
I think they were saying that age shouldn't be a factor. If you're 90 and someone manipulates you like this you should cut them out. 
"They said ""you are too young..."" Suggesting someone older could?"
"> He sounds slightly more mature than her though

when the relationship is explained by him. we really don't know anything about their relationship. what were they argueing about? maybe the argument was totally OPs fault, maybe he was being a terrible guy. 

not explaining the argument makes me think OP is hiding something. that he's not as innocent as he wants us to believe. "
And makes this relationship seem so wrong. A 14 year old in an LDR with a 17 year old? Idk why but that sits ill with me.  
oooooooooooooookay that's a VERY important detail...
She was deliberately mean and hurtful but also all she actually did was tear up a photo. The poor OP should break up and find someone a bit kinder for sure but I'm nervous about seeing teenage petulance classed as abuse.
A prior post of his says 14. 
"I think if I would have been cheated on 5 times already I would have stopped dating for a loooong time. That stuff just hurts but projecting it on the new boyfriend/girlfriend is wrong, imo. Can see where you‚Äôre coming from, still."
"If she‚Äôs 14...I was extremely clingy and paranoid in my first relationship when I was 15. I‚Äôm 27 now and when I look back on how I was then, I cringe so hard. 

OP absolutely should break up with her - the biggest mistake I and the boyfriend I had at 15 made was staying in it too long and letting it get toxic. 

That said, posters here should reserve judgement on her - a 14 year old acting this way isn‚Äôt that alarming, and hopefully she‚Äôll grow out of some of this. 

I can say that for me, it came from thinking TV was what real life and real relationships would be like. The older I got and the more I experienced, the less that was true. "
"She was a hookup, we met on holiday.

After we hooked up we texted and skyped for a while and she blew my mind. I started to really like her, and 1 month after the holiday we had our ""first date"".

Since this, I did not touch any girl that's not her.

But, I told her that every relationship I've ever been in started from a hookup (never drunken hookups btw) and this kind of bothers her."
"In Little Women, the youngest sister threw her oldest sisters manuscript in the fire because of a boy so teenage girls aren't like suddenly evil. They've always been. ü§£"
Omfg are you seriously diagnosing a 14 year old with BPD based on a reddit post. 
">This behavior will NOT get any better.

Assuming she‚Äôs similar age to OP it probably will get better as she grows up, but it‚Äôll take a few educational dumpings like the one OP is (hopefully) about to administer."
She‚Äôs a child. Of course this behavior will get better. Not necessarily in this relationship but you‚Äôre saying that as a young teen you had stellar relationship behavior?
"I loled at the enemy for life stuff. Someone should tell her life is not a cartoon. She'll probably get over it in a few years.

For now she's unstable tho."
Its 3 years! Not 10 lol
The friendships/going out part is exacttly the same in my situation...
[removed]
"I mean she's 14 and they do crazy irrational shit because they're literally children. She may well grow up to be psycho, or the greatest humanitarian alive. We don't know because shes got another decade of becoming who she is and growing up."
I should tell my ex to read this thread
"Girlfriend is only 14,  FYI "
Going from his past post his girlfriend is only 14.
"Most likely it's ""how dare you ignore me"" and then the vindictiveness comes out. She will be that person. She's just in the process of forming that personality now. "
"> So it's possible she's never learned

Well she's certainly learned now that there are consequences.

I still wouldn't be able to get over the fact that my SO would actively try to hurt me just because we were arguing.

If I was OP, I wouldn't be able to be in a relationship with this person anymore.

Hopefully she does learn from this and is more successful in the future. But if she abuses OP like this and he comes back to her, then she won't learn anything and it will reenforce to her that this is right."
Even 90 is too young to put up with manipulation like that.
"I think maybe you are focusing too much on age... he was more saying ' live your life and dont get caught up in it'

where as if you where 35 and with the girl for 10+ years this would be a different story, and cutting them out of your life instantly would be pretty irrational and immature of an adult that age after sinking so much time, effort and emotional resources into a relationship, without trying to fix an issue or figure out a problem.

Tl;DR at 17 you are not fully matured and should be focusing on having fun before life gets shitty and you have to adult"
"The idea is that young people are still innocent to how shitty the world can really be.  Being exposed to that level of bullshit at a young age is always sad. It doesn't mean it's acceptable at any age, it's just sad when you have to explain how the world can be to kids at any age."
"He doesn't need to tell random people on the internet every sordid detail of his teenage love life. The amount of info he shared is appropriate for the questions he is asking: 1, should I end it, 2, where do I go from there. "
He explains the argument in the comments. Basically he asked advice about her to someone else and she got mad. Extremely insecure
I know why that sits ill with you. It's creepy.
"Probably two socially awkward teens who met on an online forum or some such, of similar levels of immaturity and social inexperience. That‚Äôs my read, anyhow. And in their online echo chamber they‚Äôll see anyone who points out the age issue as just denying their love or some melodramatic way to ignore confrontinf the issue."
I can see your point but teen relationships can be abusive and people dismiss it because of age. Perhaps abusive is too strong of a word but this girl's behavior is unacceptable. Better for him to learn that now than start to normalize it. It's not just destroying the gift. It's the concerns that he'll do something bad. Teens should be taught to recognize unhealthy patterns in relationships and know that some behavior should be tolerated. 
"Teens are more desperate than most to always be in a relationship, mind. They often don‚Äôt get how being single could be good for them. "
"There's a difference between a hookup when you're single and free to do so, and when you're in a relationship - if you're in a relationship it's cheating, if you aren't, there's nothing wrong with it and you have nothing to excuse."
How are you defining hook up? Should a 17 year old really be randomly banging 14 year olds? You‚Äôre gonna be putting yourself in some hot water if you keep that up. 
"> She was a hookup, we met on holiday.

Wait.  You hooked up with a *fourteen-year old?*

Statutory rape ain't a good look, dude.  Dollars to donuts she's been abused in her past, and we're supposed to see that the victim here is *you?*

Leave her *because you are bad for her* and in the future, only hook-up with people who have the legal right to drive."
OMG that scene always makes me so angry!
My point exactly. :D
Shes fricken 14. Shes got a decade or more before shes truly grown grown.
"I didn‚Äôt act like that. Sadly she‚Äôs learned the behavior from somewhere. Hopefully that isn‚Äôt happening to her.

Bad behavior like that begins at a young age and can improve but it might just be who she is already."
"Assisting with this level of anxiety has problems that you are never going to be able to help them with. She has to deal with her anxiety problems, it is not a problem you resolved by you trying to alter your behavior. If you care about her, or care about people who might interact with her in the future, you might want to convey that to her. She needs help, and she's just going to have a string of toxic relationships where she abuses other people until she gets it. "
[removed]
That's a huge age difference at that age. I'm a bit squicked out.
Which post are you looking at?
"If that's the case, then OP should drop her like a hot potato.

OTOH if she is in the process of forming the personality, think of that like a dog during puppyhood.  It is learning which actions create good results and which actions create bad results.  If she learns here that 'intentionally hurt your partner = partner leaves' and takes that lesson to heart, then perhaps this will be useful for everyone.  "
"I think it also makes a much larger impact as it‚Äôs one of the earlier/first relationships you experience and can really make a huge difference in how you perceive or act in future relationships, which will be arguably more significant and meaningful if made out right. I have firsthand experience with toxic early relationships negatively impacting future ones. It‚Äôs an impressionable age and we are all starry eyed for our first romances. Getting out of a bad one as soon as possible will only mean for better things"
I think you took my comment way too seriously
OP posted later that they had a hookup when they met her on vacation. So I guess they must be somewhat functional enough socially to be having vacation hookups. I consider myself functional and I can‚Äôt pull that off! lol 
That's what I always tell her.

"It‚Äôs vile and because OP didn‚Äôt mention that in his post, the poor girl is being called a psychopath when really she‚Äôs just a kid who isn‚Äôt ready for any of this."
"17/2+7=15.5
Yyyeah. The rule checks out."
"I think maybe you took the 'age' part too seriously?

EDIT:nice try at damage control btw"
"Then I think it's clear she isn't getting the message, will never trust you, and you aren't going to convince her, dude. You don't need this bullshit in your life at 17. I have a brother your age, I'd say the same thing to him."
[removed]
"This is giving a lot of benefit of the doubt, but 17 and 14 isn‚Äôt always such a huge gap necessarily. Especially when the older one is a bit developmentally behind - socially awkward and so has less social experience, or has some mental health issues that have stunted their growth somewhat, or just plain ol‚Äô immaturity. Often at that age group you just get attracted to those in your peer group, and if his is mostly online then he‚Äôs going to get crushes on people of varying ages because his peer group isn‚Äôt restricted to school years/grades. 

Seems like these are two clueless kids dating on the internet and taking things way too seriously for how unserious they are, and both doing stupid things and making stupid decisions. 

He should dump this noise for thinking that deliberately trying to hurt her partner is an acceptable part of a relationship, but also because she‚Äôs 14 and so idiotic beliefs or decisions like this will not be a one-off. And yeah because soon enough he‚Äôll be 18 and she‚Äôll be 15 and even many of the most generous romeo & juliet laws will start not protecting him from much. 

Finding someone his own age that he can interact with in person from the start would be a vast improvement for all involved."
Why are you dissecting such a simple comment. It‚Äôs not that serious lol...

"There's a website you should Google called love is respect. Please, read the articles and checklists. 

I suspect your relationship isn't as good as you think and there will be further red flags once you know what they are. There's always a first time they hurt you, but there's very rarely a *last* time they hurt you. You should seriously consider how you're going to exit this relationship."
">He then gets in my face and says ""for fucks sake voltage, did it really  hurt that fucking bad? I cant fucking believe you"" and storms off inside  the restaurant.

get away from this guy, it will get worse.

>What did I do to deserve that?

Nobody deserve that, no matter what they do. So don't let him use as an excuse.

and i will addd that IF it was a mistake he would be horrified by his actions and apologize after 1 second. He did not. He started apologizing when you got home because he realized that he was not going to get away with this. This is the ultimate proof that something is wrong with him."
"I have grabbed my girlfriend in that manner once. You know why? She was about to step in front of a speeding car that would have killed her. I grabbed her arm and yanked back hard, and she did have a bruise on her arm, but was glad to not be in a crumpled heap in the middle of the road. That is the only time I have touched her in that manner, and that was because I was concerned for her life. You were not in any life threatening danger. Nobody else was in any life threatening danger, or even mild danger. It sounds to me like maybe a server had to walk slightly around you, or somethong as insignificant as that, and your boyfriend used that as an excuse to explode. You being ""in the way"" was not the issue. His anger is the issue."
"You need to leave. If this is the first time, it's a sign of things to come. "
"You did not overreact. Your bf was violent and that is never okay. 

DO NOT OPEN THE BATHROOM DOOR as it sounds like the situation may not be safe. 

Do you live together? Has he been violent or abusive before? How long have you been together?  

It is probably best if you can get some space and be on your own for a bit to calm down and then think about next steps. You can ask him to leave, but if he does not immediately do so, but starts to argue, call a trusted friend or the police and do not open the door until they get there. Then pack a bag and leave with them to stay at your parents' or friends' for a few days while you think things through. 

Violence and abuse escalates the longer you are together. My advice would be to leave him now before you are seriously hurt. "
"From what you wrote... no, you didn't overreact. His response to your reaction to being grabbed is also pretty telling. Any normal and well-adjusted adult would have apologized immediately.  

Since it sounds like it just happened, you should ask him to leave. If he won't go then *you* should leave and spend the night somewhere else. Now is not the time to talk about this. Emotions are too high and the chances of things getting even more out of hand are better than average if you discuss this now. 

Take the night and/or next day to think about what you want to do. Reflect on your relationship and *be honest with yourself*. Was this first sign? It probably wasn't. Make sure you take care of yourself. "
"You did nothing, absolutely nothing, wrong.

If you're in your place ask him to leave. Once. If he doesn't, call the cops and tell them you're barricaded in the bathroom and he won't leave. And, yes, I'm very very serious about the cops. Doesn't matter what he says you could walk out that door and be badly beaten. These guys are very good at the whole I'm so sorry thing.

If you're arm is bruised file against him and get a protective order.

At any rate ghost him and DO NOT let him back in your life. This has nowhere to go but straight to hell. He's showed his colors, pay attention. "
"I‚Äôm going to tell you the thing I always tell someone in your situation: if your boyfriend punched you in the face on your very first date, would you still be with him today? The answer would be no. What about on the second date? Still probably no. Now take that punch down a notch to a grab or a forceful shove. Now how about after three months? Now three years? The point I‚Äôm making here is that violence starts somewhere, and it doesn‚Äôt always start with an obviously aggressive move. In fact, it‚Äôs usually something like what you just experienced. An abuser waits until you‚Äôre dependent on him in one way or another - you‚Äôre in love, you have nobody else in your life, you don‚Äôt have money. And once violence starts in a relationship, it will never stop until you leave or you die. Sure, it might seem better for a while, but that‚Äôs the upturn in the cycle. You can‚Äôt go back to the relationship you had before the violence started because it was a mirage.  

This might sound harsh or extreme, but I promise you it is 100% sensible. Don‚Äôt worry about how long you‚Äôve been with him, three years isn‚Äôt very long in the span of your lifetime. But a future of fear and hiding in bathrooms is not an ideal one. Take care of yourself."
"If you're on vacation with friends and possibly can't leave ask one of them to switch rooms with you. (Preferably if a guy can switch cause I doubt he'd start shit with a dude.) 

Tell them what happened if they're decent friends they'll have your back and make sure you're okay. As soon as you get home gtfo and away from him. Stay safe OP. "
"My ex and I played that exact same scenario. The next scenario was being straight up tied up and held captive while he ranted about how much he loved me and how I'd be a bitch if I left.

Leave. You can. Call all your friends, any family. Ask someone to help you rent a car or an Uber. Catch a train or a flight back home if it's that far. Anything. If someone at the trip could be supportive, tell them and stick to them like glue. "
"At first it's a grab that ""did it really hurt that bad?"". Then a kick. Then a punch. And god knows what is next. Honesty I would say get out now, that shit is scary and not somewhere I would want to be. You might think, oh it's just once I'll let it slide, but don't. My father has anger management and I live in a constant world of anxiety whenever he is even in the same building as me, it's a horrible place to be, get out now before you feel trapped.

Ps. My dad has never used physical violence but other things can hurt too. I'm okay with it and understand he's stressed and has issues but he can really explode on me for very insignificant things sometimes and it's awful. I still love him and he's still my dad and I know he would never get physical so I'm accepting of it."
"Get out of this relationship and never look back. This is only the beginning of the abuse he will begin to heap upon you. Not only did he physically hurt you, he is emotionally abusive also.

Get out. Now! "
"I ignored the signs that my ex was an abuser.  On our third date he screamed at me in the street over a minor annoyance. He was constantly moody and mercurial. Less than a year into dating he knocked a fork out of my mouth (hurting my gums) then flipped my plate of food across the kitchen floor. I had grown up with so much physical and verbal abuse from my parents, that I only noticed his behavior was abnormal when it exceeded what they had done to me. By the time you develop abused woman's mentality it's too late. You get sucked into many years with a monster, and it will leave scars that haunt you for a lifetime.  It changes your personality for the worse and you become cynical and distrustful and depressed for years after you leave. 

My relationship ended with him literally torturing me and telling me he wished I would suffer and die. Obviously by then it was clear I had to get a restraining order and flee, but there was so much fucked up bullshit that preceded it that should have triggered me to leave.

You just had a moment like that with him, and I'm sure if you think about it there have been others. I hope you have the wisdom and strength to walk away now. You will save yourself from a lot of long term pain if you do."
"Take pictures.

If he's marked you in any way, take pictures and save them somewhere. Check each day and photograph any bruises that appear. Email them to yourself to save a copy

 You're in a situation you can't just walk away from right now (the vacation with friends) and that's OK but you are going to need some proof for yourself, for anyone who asks and for him if he attempts to say it didn't happen, he didn't hurt you etc

Be safe while you're on holiday, stay with other friends as much as possible and pack your shit up and leave as soon as you get back home."
"You have to ask yourself if there have been other signs that you have ignored.

If so, then you leave the relationship immediately because your safety is in jeopardy.

If this event was a one time incident, he needs to be medically checked for some physical or emotional problem.

Typically boyfriends who have anger issues behave the way you‚Äôre describing here, are you absolutely sure he hasn‚Äôt been awful in other situations?"
"Started off being grabbed and pushed myself. For months. Leave. If he is going to change, he needs to be able to do it on his own. you don‚Äôt have to be collateral for that. 

Edit: I really thought my ex would change. It ended up where I called the police while he was throwing things at me outside my apartment complex (earlier, he hit, slapped, dragged me). He was arrested (I didn‚Äôt know that would happen but where I live is an automatic arrest state) and jailed. Of course I gave someone else money to bail him out. 

After moving out for a bit, I broke up with him. Despite his promises of change. Guess what? He has not attended a single court date, and now has an arrest warrant. So much for change, which was conditional and dependent on me staying with him. "
"After reading your edit, if you are sharu g a room with him you should tell one of your friends what happened and ask if you can stay in their room for the remainder of the trip. You are not safe with this guy."
"If a friend told you their bf did this to them, what would you advise your friend? 

You know you aren't overreacting. Treat yourself like you would treat a friend. Time to leave."
"He has anger issues you say? And he's never been violent but he's loud? Please get away from this man as soon as you return from vacation. Use this time to figure out a way out when you return home.   

Between the anger issues and being being loud I don't like this one bit. He's irritated and showing his true self. Listen to the signs he's giving off because alarm bells are ringing in my head just reading this.  

I've had boyfriends get mad or angry, but none have EVER grabbed me hard enough to hurt. Ever. You know who used to do shit like that to me though? My abusive father. His anger was explosive. He'd yell and scream at you and corner you. If you weren't listening to his standards he'd grab you and pull you until you were in tears. Don't put up with that shit.  

Please keep yourself safe. You deserve so, so much more than that. Don't let him trap you and escalate his violence. Reach out to friends and family once you're free of him if you need the support."
"Nobody Does this on a first date. And there's a reason why. It's because they would never get a second date. Imagine if he had done this to you on your first date. Would you have ever called him again? Of course not. Because you know you deserve better. The only reason you even think you should stay now, is because your mind is coming up with all sorts of rationalizations, because leaving him would be so painful. I know. It sucks. None of this is your fault. He hurt you, he was violent with you, you said he has anger issues, clearly they are not resolved, in fact they are escalating. He hasn't worked on them at all. He may have had good moments, but he hasn't worked on addressing the root cause at all.

Imagine this was your first date. What would you be telling yourself?

Would you be telling yourself to give him another chance, he's probably a great guy if you get to know him, he probably didn't mean it, why not see where this goes?

Or hopefully, would you be telling yourself that this is absolutely unacceptable, he assaulted you, it was terrifying, and no one deserves to be treated that way, no matter what?"
"Even if you were in the way of anyone, he could have said ""look out"" instead of hurting you. And then when you tell him he hurt you, he had the gall to try and make you feel bad about it!

  


Good on you for going home. If your boyfriend was in someone's way, you wouldn't grab and yank him so hard it hurt him would you?

  


It's up to you whether you want to break up like others have said, I would probably text and ask why he had such an outburst first, keeping in mind if there was no reason (e.g. He just lost it for no reason and starts apologising) then I'd be convinced to do something. "
"You need to get out of that relationship as soon as you are safe to do so. He just physically abused you - in public. It will only get much worse from here. If you live together, make plans to get out one day when he's at work and let him know you're done once you're safe, and if you don't, change your locks if he has a key and break up by e-mail or text. "
"Ok so I read your edits.  

1.  You do not want to be in a relationship with someone with anger issues


2. If he did that for no real reason what will he do in the future when there is a real fight.  He assaulted you. 

3.  The fact that it was in front of people is a good thing. If he can do that in public, what can he do in private.  

4.  I don‚Äôt care if you are with 10 friends or 100 he assaulted you and you need to never ever take that for ANY reason.  SOMEONE BEEDS TO LEAVE.  If it isn‚Äôt him, get on a bus, get a taxi or whatever and go home. You should dump him and all of your friends should know why.  

There are many relationships where the guy has anger issues and over time the become assault issues. If he grabs you once and manhandles you it will happen again.  "
"I mean there is no reason why he couldn‚Äôt have just spoken to you in a normal voice if you were doing something that was bothering him.  He did not need to put a hand on you at all, especially not in an aggressive way.  I tell my little kids all the time ‚Äúuse your words‚Äù.  He‚Äôs a grown man, he chose to get aggressive with you and you absolutely did not deserve it.  Don‚Äôt let him gaslight you now that he‚Äôs apologizing.  I would be very wary of continuing a relationship with this guy."
"I can feel your fear and confusion from here. Is there any place you can stay tonight? A friend? Family? You‚Äôre not over reacting, your bf is not safe. Please try to get out of there and google love is respect dot org. "
"Please think that if he did this once (without you ever expecting it) how easily could he do it again?

I had a boyfriend that once pulled me up from sitting on the couch by grabbing my hair.  His explanation?  We had just been arguing while in that room but decided to go out to eat.  He left the room to get something, and I sat down on the couch in the spot he had vacated to put on my shoes.  It was the spot closest to the door and we were getting ready to leave, so it made sense to me.  He accused me of ‚Äútaking his seat‚Äù.  I cried so hard because it was honestly a shock.  I never expected someone I cared about to do such a thing.  

We broke up some time after that.  I wish I had broken up with him right after that occurred.  He never did anything like that again while we were together, but I wonder if he‚Äôs done similar things in his relationships since.  It‚Äôs so easy to rationalize it as ‚Äújust one time‚Äù but think, this was an escalation of behavior for him.  Next time, he‚Äôll probably escalate further.  He may have been the best boyfriend before that, he may be an upstanding citizen in other ways (my ex worked for the federal government and had security clearance) but, for whatever reason, he sees this as an acceptable way to behave.  Don‚Äôt stick around to see if he‚Äôll do it again."
"You can leave, and you should leave. 

Super red flags. Get out before he sucks you back in. "
Get a copy of the security footage from the restaurant tonight in case they erase it.
"In addition to what everyone else has said, the timing of his first violent outburst is pretty suspect.  Being on vacation with 10 mutual friends greatly increases the chance that you won‚Äôt ‚Äúmake a scene‚Äù and leave him (in the middle of it).  It adds an element of embarrassment and shame that makes you more vulnerable and him more likely to get away with it.  It will also be easier to minimize after time has passed, after you get home.  "
"The first one happens after they are fairly sure they‚Äôve got you. 
It‚Äôs shocking. You cannot process this cognitive dissonance. 
It‚Äôs also not near as bad as it is going to get if you forgive him. Enabling is a green light. 

This is not okay. If you must stay together for a while- and there are many reasons this may be necessary- then the boundary is: this will never happen again or you will contact authorities and file a report for domestic violence. 

That can buy you time. But the pink cloud period will make you forget and then the abuse will then become passive aggressive. Silent treatments, gaslighting, smears, financial abuse. 

Even if someone told me as I am telling you. I wouldn‚Äôt have believed it. And I was certified in domestic violence and even gave some training on it! 
Love is a powerful drug. "
Please leave him.. forget him and move on
"This is NOT an overreaction.  Don‚Äôt allow him to convince you that this was a minor glitch.  This is who you are dating.  This is a red flag waving in your face.  You need to consider your self-worth. Please, for your safety, leave him.  "
This man is very dangerous and he was gaslighting you when he tried to say you were overreacting. This is the beginning of the cycle of abuse. Please be safe and get yourself out of there as far away from him as you can. 
"You did NOTHING wrong, and you never let anybody touch you like that. That is not okay, ever, and he sounds like a storm of trouble brewing, if you ask me"
"If he‚Äôs willing to do this in public, what is he going to do to you in private?"
"You don't actually have a lot to think about, unless you mean how to disentangle your life from this shithead"
That's a tough situation given all the factors. How many days do you have left on your vacation? Are there people in the group you can talk to about this in the group? I'm sorry you had to experience this when you should have been happy with your partner on a holiday. Take care of yourself please.
"You can never 'overreact' if your boyfriend is violent to you, verbally or physically, or both. Get out of this situation, this is the face he will show you more and more as time passes by and you two develop more and more in the relationship. Seek support from us, from friends, this doesn't sound okay. You could have done the most horrible thing, which you obviously didn't, he still wouldn't have the right to do that. "
You are definitely NOT overreacting. He shouldn't act like that towards you- EVER. It does sound like you should be talking to him about it-  and is huge red flag for the future. If you already have bad vibes from this situation I'd say that's enough to say get out of this relationship immediately. 
It's just going to get worse if you don't leave him.
"Leave. Don't excuse him. Just cut him off of your life. That's common sign of a violent person.

If you want examples, look for news from DR; here we have a plague of domestic violence because and in many cases the assailant is excused by his SO; and only get worst."
"I dated a guy like that and he would blame it on how frustrating *I* was. 

He also used that excuse when he'd choke me during sex and I'd beg him to stop, and also after he tried to kill me 2 years later.

Don't date guys like this. It's not worth it."
"All i can tell you is this, no way on earth even if my life depended on it, would i ever lay an hand on my wife. Not only my wife but no other woman either. Remember this also, the first time is the hardest, when someone puts there hands on you once and shows violence. You can almost  guarantee the it will happen again, at some point."
"Addressing your edit  - unless you want a lifetime of abuse and a lifetime of abuse for any children you may have you have nothing to think about. You end this relationship asap and to be safe do it in public while your friends are nearby so if he physically lashes out at you, you have protection"
"I often think about what‚Äôs normal in these situations where I read posts about abusive behaviour or semi-violent explosions. Seems like what would be ‚Äúnormal‚Äù would be to put my hand on my girlfriend‚Äôs waist and gently guide her out of the way of others, not yank her and yell at her.  I‚Äôm sorry to hear this happened to you. It‚Äôs definitely inexcusable behaviour. You should leave him. "
"I did something similar to a girl once, she said her arm hurt for a few days. Probably was okay in comparison to the truck that almost hit her. When I started reading this I thought perhaps it was a similar situation. It is not. WTH get out now before the monster comes out of his cage."
"LEAVE HIM. Do not fucking second guess that for one moment. You need to LEAVE, NOW before it gets even a little worse. "
The fact that you‚Äôre even considering staying with him says to me that his emotional abuse has worn you down to a dangerous level. Get away as soon as you can.
Red flags everywhere. Please leave!! 
"As somebody who had an ex that did similar things, I REALLY wish I had left a lot sooner. I finally dropped him after 3 years. It was incredibly hard, especially because I thought I loved him. I made excuses for his shit behavior because everything else was ""fine.""


Please don't hang on like I did.

I was so nervous to leave. I'm close to 30, didn't want to start over as a single lady this age, was feeling very insecure in myself and my decisions. But I went through with it, kicked him out of my house, and left him. 

After a week of dropping him out of my life, I starting gaining back a confidence I hadn't even realized I had lost. Years of emotional abuse and manipulation had stripped me of my strength and I didn't even realize it. It's been about a year now, and I can't imagine the shell of myself I would have been had I stayed with him and kept blaming myself for his abuse.

Get your strength back and leave! "
Is this a single time and was he secretly having a bad day (still not okay but maybe not worth breakimg up over) or does he do these kinds of things more often?
[removed]
"Yea this is bad... and i understand he's tried to keep his anger away from you for some time, but it obviously was still able to be released on you and his immediate reaction was that you're in the wrong and that it didn't hurt that bad. Which means he didnt even feel sympathy after he did it. Everyone makes mistakes but it sounds like this guy only apologized after and entire walk home of you crying, which is more like him feeling bad about you crying, not for what he did specifically. Get a nice guy who doesn't want you to feel like something psycho like that is your fault."
He sounds a little borderline to me - If he's not willing to get therapy I'd say get outta there asap.
"OP, this guy, your hopefully soon-to-be-ex-bf, is using you! You need to understand this. He doesn't love you! Based on what you said went on, he hates you! And it may have nothing to do with you, so don't take it personally, he is just a phony user. The more you love a guy like that, the more he will hate you, he's probably a narcissist. 

He is undoubtedly keeping you in the dark and feeding you bullshit, does he think you're a mushroom? No! He's manipulating you, for sex maybe, or his ego, or any number of reasons, it doesn't matter. His real feelings toward you have slipped out, believe him. If you don't get away from him, more and worse bad treatment wil follow. Decades ago, when i was about your age, a brilliant psychologist told me: *When someone sends you mixed messages, always, always, always, believe the worst message. That's what they really think of you. The good message, The I-Love-You's, the I'll-Never Hurt-You's, that's just them buttering you up to get what they want.* I thought: *This couldn't possibly be true,* so i decided to pay close attention to people who send mixed messages, and have done so for decades, and guess what? It's true! When people send you mixed messages, always, always, always believe the worst one! If you think, *I want him to love me, I want to believe he loves me, because i don't want to feel the sadness. I will give him the benefit of the doubt* then you are lost. You will keep looking for love in all the wrong places.

It's time to grow up, take responsibility for your own safety and happiness and being a good and intelligent person, and get the hell away from that creep. Do not sleep with him, and make nice because you are on vacation. ""Grey Rock"" him. He deserves no better. If these other people are your friends, they will help you to not have to deal with him personally at all. If not, they aren't good friends, not to you, so don't worry about it. Contact whoever you have that really cares about you and get to a safe place and have nothing to do with him."
">we're on vacation with like 10 of our mutual friends (we had a day by ourselves today) so I can't really leave.

You can book an airbnb or a flight home. If he lives with you, contact a family member or friend who would be able to take you in on an emergency. This man is dangerous. Do not allow yourself to be alone with him."

In this case not the only issue. I should start a counter for this though."
"This is exactly what my abusive boyfriend would do to me. It started small, and gradually grew. his contempt, temper, annoyance, and unpredictability was exhausting. It escalated to grabbing my arm to get me out of the way, and then it happened ALL THE TIME every time we were in public. Then it happened at home. Then it escalated to him grabbing me during fights, blocking the door, and getting in my face during arguments. Then it was ""play fighting"" and ""tickling"" where he would physically overpower me despite my protests and begs to stop, then I would get punished for being uptight and uncool and overreacting. 

RUNNN. 

This is \*textbook\* abuse."
"The advice I always give:

Break up with the bastard. 3 years in and they use violent physical force? Run. It won‚Äôt be a one time thing "
"Responding to your edit, any chance you can leave the vacation early? Your friends will understand."
"Okay, so say you had been in a minor car accident. Your arm aches. What would your reaction be if your BF said,

\>for fucks sake voltage, did it really hurt that fucking bad? I cant fucking believe you"" and storms off inside the restaurant.

Not good, right? No empathy.

In your case, HE'S the one that hurt you. Add abusive to not sorry he hurt you. That is flat-out terrible."
"> I also should have added that he's had anger issues for a long, long time, but he's never been violent towards me, just... loud.

When you say loud, does that mean that he yells as you? Frequently? 

Does he ever call you names?

Do you feel like you have to walk on eggshells to prevent him losing his temper?

Has he ever punched walls, hit objects etc? 

It‚Äôs probable that this episode is just the latest in an abusive saga. "
"Of course you have the right to be upset. Someone you love just hurt you. Be strong and keep your distance from him for the rest of the trip. Don‚Äôt worry about ‚Äúruining‚Äù the trip for he others. If they are really your friends they will support you. In fact, if you are sharing a room with him maybe just stay with one of your friends so you have time to yourself in a safe place to process this. Please know This isn‚Äôt your fault."
"Response to your edit:

This is the start to him physically abusing you, this relationship is **OVER**.  There is no salvage, it's **OVER**

 Your ex needs to be called out on his behavior.  Get out of the bathroom and talk to your 10 friends.  Tell them **ALL** what happened.  Abuse takes place because the person who is abused  is embarrassed and hides the behavior.    I'm 6' 3"", 260 and if my friend, or GF did  this I'd be telling everyone because I'm not afraid of being embarrassed, I refuse to be abused by anyone for any reason. "
"Hi. 

I grew up with 2 brothers and 10 cousins that were all boys, and I didn't really understand how rough and violent I was until I met a woman. Being delicate is so important and I wish I had know that growing up because even in my Mid 20s I forgot how sensitive and fragile you have to be with woman. Growing up as a boy with other boys you get rough and forget how sensitive you have to be towards them especially when it comes to grabbing/handling. This shouldn't be an excuse for what he did but I think you should explain to him the seriousness of the nature and why this is not ok.

I think you should explain this to your boyfriend, Hands Off Policy when it comes to being angry and getting upset or getting in an argument. I grew up with a mom that use to abuse when you did not listen, I find myself abusing the people I love and the people around me. Its hard we seem to get the traits of our parents and its important to let him know that this wasn't ok :("
Not gonna read this . Dump him.
"No excuses for treating your love like this, no matter how upset you get you should never put your hands on the person you love. I don‚Äôt even see why he would get upset like this, it seems like such a small thing. I would look back at the last and see if there is anything else that hints he has some anger issues. I myself struggled with Anger in the past I was a yeller because I was never taught that it was not ok. Soon as we get upset my family just started yelling. So when me and my girlfriend got in our first and only huge fight that‚Äôs what I did. I lost it, I never knew I struggled with anger until that point. I look back and I want to beat myself. If I saw any guy treat his GF the way I treated mine I would Probably have hit him. We almost broke up but we worked through it, I got some help, found out what‚Äôs good and what‚Äôs a healthy way to deal with anger and frustration.  So I would talk to him and see why he did it, if he needs help get it. If he does it again or abuses you again get your friends to beat the crap out of him. Like that scene from the movie about the rocket boys. If the boy gets a bruise you get a limp, if the boy has a limp you crutches. Then again this movie  took place in the 60,s I think so that‚Äôs when eye for an eye was ok. Now you will end up in jail. So if he hurts you again just run and never look back. Find your true love that will give you the life you deserve, better to lose three years then your whole life."
When you take your girl out to eat and see your side chick sitting in the restaurant. Or when you take your side chick out and see your girl sitting in the restaurant...  Side chick thingz...
"Why the fuck did you allow this man back into your apartment?!?! Tell him, through the door to leave, or you will call the police and have him removed. Once he is gone call them anyway and report his grabbing and threatening you. Then block him, and don't look back."

">I suspect your relationship isn't as good as you think and there will be further red flags once you know what they are.

Someone I know said her relationship with her husband was perfect. Their marriage hit a rough patch and she confided in me that he would literally hold her arms to her side so she couldn't leave the room. I told her that was fucking abusive behavior, he should never put his hands on her.

""But he didn't hit me..."" She said. And I told her that he didn't hit her *yet.*

He consistently holds on to the past and throws the mistakes she made in her face. He verbally abuses her, emotionally abuses her and uses sex as punishment to prove to himself that she is still his.

He uses her like property. He shows me a nice face, but he doesn't know I know. If shit hits the fan and she needs to be safe and away from him and she finally calls the cops there is no record and he's charming enough to pull it off as a gentle lovers spat. I worry every day.  Abusers have a cycle, they are terrible and they promise to change and then they go back, sometimes more violently than before.

OP, I sincerely suggest you look up a checklist for abusive behavior and see how identical it is to your relationship."
"> IF it was a mistake he would be horrified

Confirmed. I‚Äôm mostly friends with men, some of those friendships involve general roughhousing. Occasionally one of them will misjudge their strength. Shit happens. It usually is followed by ‚Äúouch, that hurt‚Äù followed by ‚Äúoh jeez dude I‚Äôm so sorry! I feel awful!‚Äù But I‚Äôve NEVER had someone manhandle me and then say ‚Äúfor fuck‚Äôs sake, 2k, did it really hurt that fucking bad?‚Äù"
I was going to write something almost identical in that I've bruised my wife's arm a couple times by grabbing her to avoid her getting hit by a car.  She was very surprised the first time because A. she almost got hit by a car and B. realized how strong I could be especially with regards to her safety. Unlike OP there was NO question as to what happened and why it happened.   In OP's case it is obvious her BF has issues as your wrote. 
[deleted]
">From what you wrote... no, you didn't overreact. His response to your reaction to being grabbed is also pretty telling. Any normal and well-adjusted adult would have apologized immediately.

Yeah, crying and walking away is not an overreaction to... anything. And I would say a normal and well-adjusted adult wouldn't violently grab and yank around anyone, let alone anyone they care about, with the exception of an imminent safety risk or something. I certainly can't imagine treating people like that at all."
That is so scary. I‚Äôm sorry that happened to you.
"And even once she leaves (which I‚Äôm hoping she does), don‚Äôt fall for the ‚Äúoh the break up opened my eyes and now I realize it was bad.‚Äù I fell for it and it ended up being the same shit and escalated quicker. I guarantee he will try to claim some epiphany after she leaves in hopes of getting her back. OP, don‚Äôt fall for it. 

This sucks, a lot. But the relationship you had before he ever yelled at you and especially before he grabbed you is dead. It is non-recoverable with that person. Get out now before you are wasted to a shell of yourself. It took months to get myself back. That journey was hard but beautiful, don‚Äôt be scared of it. "
"**Digital abuse is the use of technologies such as texting and social networking to bully, harass, stalk or intimidate a partner. Often this behavior is a form of verbal or emotional abuse perpetrated online. You may be experiencing digital abuse if your partner:**

* Tells you who you can or can‚Äôt be friends with on Facebook and other sites.
* Sends you negative, insulting or even threatening emails, Facebook messages, tweets, DMs or other messages online.
* Uses sites like Facebook, Twitter, foursquare and others to keep constant tabs on you.
* Puts you down in their status updates.
* Sends you unwanted, explicit pictures and demands you send some in return.
* Pressures you to send explicit videos.
* Steals or insists on being given your passwords.
* Constantly texts you and makes you feel like you can‚Äôt be separated from your phone for fear that you will be punished.
* Looks through your phone frequently, checks up on your pictures, texts and outgoing calls.
* Tags you unkindly in pictures on Instagram, Tumblr, etc.
* Uses any kind of technology (such spyware or GPS in a car or on a phone) to monitor you
* You never deserve to be mistreated, online or off. Remember:

**Your partner should respect your relationship boundaries.**


* It is ok to turn off your phone. 
* You have the right to be alone and spend time with friends and family without your partner getting angry.
* You do not have to text any pictures or statements that you are uncomfortable sending, especially nude or partially nude photos, known as ‚Äúsexting.‚Äù
You lose control of any electronic message once your partner receives it. They may forward it, so don‚Äôt send anything you fear could be seen by others.
* You do not have to share your passwords with anyone.
* Know your privacy settings. Social networks such as Facebook allow the user to control how their information is shared and who has access to it. These are often customizable and are found in the privacy section of the site. Remember, registering for some applications (apps) require you to change your privacy settings.
* Be mindful when using check-ins like Facebook Places and foursquare. Letting an abusive partner know where you are could be dangerous. **Also, always ask your friends if it‚Äôs ok for you to check them in. You never know if they are trying to keep their location secret.**
* You have the right to feel comfortable and safe in your relationship, even online.

I know it's a lot, but the moment I saw I was getting through to my friend is when I showed her a reddit post of a situation almost identical to hers and the subsequent comments outlining the abusive behaviors. I saw that lightbulb click and I hope I can get through to someone else today.

Being abused is never okay. Nothing you could ever do would cause you to deserve it. It's hard to see when you're in it, but if you can recognize the signs it's one step closer to being safer.
"
They're on vacation together so I'm assuming he has his own key card. OP should tell their friends and switch rooms with them or leave the trip earlier. 
">In all seriousness though, not okay, but if you have been on a mutual vacation could you have been acting in a way that he did not like? 

""Did you do something he didn't like, causing him to react with physical violence and screaming?"" is pretty terrible advice. "
"Nah man, she edited that her BF does have anger issues and has been loud to her before, but never yet physical, until today. They escalate...just like your run of the mill untreated mentall ilness sufferers. 


People with anger issues, regardless of gender, make some very, very tough partners. Enough news out there about partners with angry issues taking it far too far, one of those is that woman who crashed her car into a restaurant because she was angry with her BF. "
"I lived the ""but he didn't hit me"" life for fourteen years and had no idea it was so much abuse, until the end. "
"This what horror is, that poor poor woman üò¢"
"My boyfriend and I like to do that too, and he always gets super remorsefull when he realizes that he played a bit too hard! Sometimes he gets genuinely surprised, but he always apologizes right away. "
"That‚Äôs what this reply is saying - that with the exception of saving someone from danger, there‚Äôs no excuse for violently grabbing them."
That was the whole point of the comment...
"It was terrifying, but also exasperating? Like ""oh god, don't kill me, but can we wrap this up already?""

I don't tolerate any violence or aggression in relationships, mine or others. It escalates, and in my experience always has. No boyfriend just occasionally hits their partner. No girlfriend just has the one wild rage. "
"Ah, well that's not good. She should contact security and ask for an escort out of the resort, maybe."

"Yes, and I'm not contradicting it, am I?"
"I agree, and I was only adding to it."
">I'm just saying that we are all human. I don't think what he did was right, I'm saying that there might be an explanation. 

It doesn't matter what the explanation is. You're saying that OP should reflect on if she ""acted in a way he didn't like"" because he decided to scream in her face and grab her aggressively.

Having OP walk on eggshells so her boyfriend doesn't get physically violent with her is not going to save any relationship."
"No? Not if it‚Äôs not worth saving, and certainly not if it‚Äôs abusive."
Actually most of us are concerned with saving the OP from further violence. 
">I'm just saying that we are all human. I don't think what he did was right, I'm saying that there might be an explanation

And what possible ""explanation"" is there to get physically and verbally abusive with your girlfriend?"
"> We are trying to save this relationship after all, aren't we?

The point of this sub isn't to ""save"" every relationship.

It's to provide posters advice on what to do next, given the specific circumstances in their relationship(s).

In this case, OP's boyfriend has a long history of anger issues, has angrily yelled at OP in the past, and has now escalated to physically harming her (then getting even more mad at her for being hurt) while in a public setting.

The best thing *by far* for OP is to get out of this already abusive relationship, before it gets worse."
"Her post essentially says he has already been yelling or screaming at her. This isn‚Äôt an accident, it‚Äôs escalation"
"No matter how angry they are, normal people don't just manhandled their partners. 


I think she freaked out because of the classic 'he has temper problem, but he'd never hurt me.'


I don't know about you, but if your GF manhandled you in public, and then telling you later that she did that because she has been a little annoyed by you and the annoyance has been building up, will you stay with her? "
"Well, you deleted your comment, however it did appear that you were saying the comment was irrelevant."
Lol all it read was /r/whoosh.  If added nothing
[removed]
"I have seen some people with anger issues and that makes me be a bit biased when it comes to even being close to them. It's because they always escalate and very rarely that they ever changed their ways. And depends on where you are, people look away if someone gets abused even physically. I came from a place where beating children in public is just bueno...so...


I do agree on asking him wth, but I personally don't think any reason would have made me stay for someone with a poor control of emotion. But that also because I have the same standard for myself on how I treat others. 


"
"Considering that you explicitly stated you didn't want him to replicate the story, I understand you being upset. I can also understand not being totally over it and ready to celebrate as if you have nothing to be upset about.

*However*, as someone who has been married almost 11 years, I highly recommend taking a minute alone to scream, cry, kick a pillow, whatever you need to do to release your frustration, and then try to move on and enjoy your evening. He's apologized, he's trying to make it up to you, and a good marriage is one of forgiveness. You'll be the one apologizing for something sooner or later, so extend the grace to him that you'd like to receive.

Also, plan your next anniversary, birthday, etc together! It's a lot of pressure on your spouse to have to come up with an evening you'll both enjoy, and placing the responsibility on both your shoulders will prevent a lot of potentially disappointing celebrations:)

P.s. Congrats on your one year milestone!!"
Tell him you feel disappointed. It's how you feel. Then hug each other. And then enjoy the dinner together. He is now aware to not do jokes like that again.
"I bet if you ask your mom privately, at the time it happened, she was probably not very happy with your dad turning up like he did. And just like your dad's early snaffu, one day you will laugh and retell the story of how your husband screwed up your first anniversary. "
"It wasn‚Äôt spiteful. It wasn‚Äôt mean. It was perhaps embarrassing and cheesy, and a little gross because it‚Äôs recreating a memory of your parents‚Äô romance. Copying someone else‚Äôs romantic move on an anniversary feels the opposite of special, and that sucks. 

He apologized so let it go is my advice. Also, I would be confused if I were him. You bring this memory up every time you get together with family, showing it is important, then get this upset when he tries to incorporate this important  romantic thing into your anniversary. Yeah when you said you didn‚Äôt want it done he should have taken it at face value, but bringing it up at every get together isn‚Äôt helping. Plus you said your mom loves the story but feigns embarrassment - perhaps he thought you were doing the same by saying ‚Äòdon‚Äôt ever do that‚Äô. You have to admit, it‚Äôs a mixed message. I suggest your family moves on to retelling other stories, at least around your significant others, instead of romanticizing it. 

Maybe what‚Äôs really bothering you about this is he couldn‚Äôt come up with a unique and romantic gesture himself, and that‚Äôs really disappointing. Especially considering you have your parents - who sound like they‚Äôve had a lovely romance - to compare yourself to. 
"
"You have every right to be upset - you made your expectations clear, and your husband didn‚Äôt respect that. 

It sounds like he genuinely feels bad now though, and is trying to make it up to you. I‚Äôm not sure what else can be done at this point. But you‚Äôre not overreacting IMO. "
">he's trying to make it up to me tonight by taking me to dinner and shopping 

That's nice of him. As long as he also apologizes and promises not to do any pranks like that again, just let it go."
"I actually think it's romantic. Reenacting the first date of your long-term happily married parents? Joining in on a family joke? I mean, he is family now, isn't he? So why are you excluding him from it?

But then again, if you've told him not to, you've told him not to. But see this for what it is - an extremely romantic, but misguided, gesture. And now that's he's apologised and tried to fix it, let him."
"Your husband will do more stupid things than this.

Forgive stupid. Forgive it as much as you can. Stupid often can't be remedied.

Selfish? Mean? Spiteful? These things can be remedied, and as such, should be forgiven only for a time.

Was your husband stupid, or selfish?

"
"You specially told him not to do something and he did it. That's his bad. But honestly I'm still wondering why you don't want it so bad. Like why is there a blanket ban on it? If it's a funny story for your family and the beginning of the relationship that created your entire family, why is it off limits? It just doesn't make sense. "
"I can‚Äôt imagine a scenario where saying ‚Äúdon‚Äôt show up with KFC and Trojans‚Äù would be taken seriously, especially given the fact that y‚Äôall laugh about it. I highly doubt anyone could really interpret that in a serious context. I think it‚Äôs funny and sweet and it obviously isn‚Äôt some sort of sore subject for you, so let it go. I also have doubts that he wasn‚Äôt planning on doing something serious for you afterwards. "
"The biggest issue I have with this is the ""prank"" wasn't even funny. It was unoriginal. If you are going to go against your SO's wishes, especially on a special day, it better be like insanely funny or cute or clever or whatever. This was none of those things.

The bottom line is that I fear you may have married an unfunny person. "
Making too big a deal - yes.  Get over it. There are bigger things to fight about.  
"Did your husband ever explain his thinking? 

Like why on Earth he thought replicating his father-in-law‚Äôs courtship gaffe AGAINST THE EXPRESSED WISHES OF HIS WIFE was an appropriate way to celebrate a year of marriage to this woman? 

Does he believe the first anniversary is the ‚Äúplease get me something I expressly said I never wanted‚Äù anniversary?

Does he consistently go for the lolz even when asked not to?"
"My husband and I just celebrated 6 years of marriage (10 years total together)

Honestly op, just tell him you're disappointed (but I bet her knows now) and move on. In a few years you'll look back and laugh if you even remember what you did that day. 

Anniversaries dont have to be a big to do either, they can be calm and quiet "
"I know firsthand exactly how hurtful it is when a spouse doesn't care about an occasion that's important to you and doesn't treat you special on special days. And you even did the grown-up thing and used your words, and he exactly to the letter did what you told him not to do and nothing else! I'd be pissed and I wouldn't feel like having a hasty make-up celebration.

If I were you, I'd try to talk to him. ""Husband, what's important to me here is not a fancy dinner or presents. What I want is to feel like you love, respect, and cherish me. When you brush off our anniversary and act like it's an ordeal I'm dragging you through, I don't feel loved or cherished. When you ignore the things I specifically verbally ask for, I don't feel loved or respected. I told you many times, specifically, that copying my father wouldn't be funny and wasn't what I wanted. You did it anyway. I know this is a shocker, but it turned out *exactly* like I told you it would: it wasn't funny, and it wasn't what I wanted. So now, please listen to my words and pay attention this time: I don't want to go to dinner. I'm upset and hurt, and I know you don't actually want this or you would have planned it from the start, so this won't be fun for either of us. What I would like is for you to give me some time to feel better, and then at \[next holiday/birthday/occasion\] let's do something extra nice that will count for both."""
"I would be kind of irritated considering you made it clear not to do that and its your first anniversary. I would need a little time to laugh it off but its not a huge deal. I would do as other suggested and plan anniversaries as things you do together, not gifts, to avoid this in the future. And make sure he knows when you're serious about not doing something especially for a special time."
"You have a right to have expectations, and ya it sucks he did something you've said you didn't want. However I do not think he was doing it to be malicious. It was a misguided attempt at comedy and getting in on your family funny story that is told at all family events. As you said he is a funny guy with a sense of humor. Again while you 100% have the right to expectations. Many people have different expectations about what a good anniversary is. Next time make your expectations about what you DO want clear so that you both are on the same page.
All in all, Express your feeling to him, take a minute to calm down and then forgive and move on. Don't let this ruin what could still be a good anniversary. 10 years down the line you will want to remember as a smh moment and laugh it off, not as a horrible upsetting first anniversary. "
What did you do for him for your anniversary?
">he's trying to make it up to me tonight by taking me to dinner and shopping but it just feels so forced now.

Tell him you'll have a do over anniversary another time, but right now you're still too mad to enjoy a dinner out.  

>Am I making too big of deal of this? Or am I allowed to have reasonable expectations to not get pranked on special days, especially pranks I've asked him to never do?

You're right to be upset. You told him a boundary and he totally disregarded it.  What other things is he going to  boundary stomp/go against your wishes?  If you want to keep financial information private, will he tell his mother all your business?  

Do something for yourself tonight - without him.  

"
Look you told him not to do it but what is the point of an anniversary? To express feelings and refer to a past history. I honestly find the really cute. The point of an anniversary isn't necessarily gifts or a night out unless you value materialism over the meaning behind it. Your mom and dad ended up together for 30 years. Im guessing your boyfriend is showing something cute that became a serious forever relationship. I'm not saying he's proposing but he's drawing a parallel between your mom and dad and you and him. That is showing he takes your relationship seriously. It also shows he has a sense of humour and that he remembers things from your personal family history and incorporated it into a joke that is unique to your family. I guess tastes are different so only you can decide what you wanted an anniversary to be and why you told him not to do it and you're still free to tell him you would like a more serious emotional or fancy anniversary but I actually think this is extremely cute and well intentioned and I think you should look at what he was trying to express. It's something he took a little planning to do and rejecting that and being mad at him almost seems cruel. Hopefully this too can be a story the two of you laugh about.
Now the story will live on with a sequel for your kids.
"yeah, he forgot the part of the prank where it is suppose to be funny. He owes you and you are not making too big a deal."
He messed up trying to make you laugh. I think it's fine you didn't like it and give him shit for it and you need to voice that to him for the future. But he can't undo what he thought was a funny idea now. I think you know his intent was good so keep that in mind as your processing it.
"On top of all that, talk about a lame, unfunny, uncreative thing to do! He literally just copied something your dad did years ago. And I really truly believe that if you repeatedly tell someone that you seriously do not want them to do X thing and they keep doing it as a joke, they don't listen to you, they don't respect you, and they don't give a shit about what you want. Your husband sucks."
"When you told him specifically not to repeat it, even as a joke... did he know what you meant? Did he think you meant ""Don't repeat the story, verbally, as a joke you are telling""? Or did he understand that you meant ""Don't *do* something like that, even as a joke""?

If he understood you correctly... then you have a right to be upset, because he ignored your express wishes and a boundary that you were very clear on. So, if that's the case, *why* did he do this? That's what you need to ask him.

But it's possible that he misunderstood, in which case, you still have a right to be disappointed, but it's more forgivable. So try to get an understanding of what was going through his head and *why* he did what he did. That may help you feel better and help you forgive him.

Either way, talk to him, and tell him how you feel. Explain that you'd love to go to dinner and plan a different anniversary celebration, but you are upset and you need a little time to recover first."
"I mean if this is your biggest problem with your husband I‚Äôd say you‚Äôve got it made. I would have to say get over it, girlfriend. "
"This guy is your husband.  He's not your boyfriend, not your fiance, not some one-night rando.

You have to really gauge for yourself whether you believe his intent was malicious: whether he set out to humiliate, abuse or disgust you.  This depends on who you both are and how you usually relate to each other.  If he's a Merry Prankster usually and it usually makes you laugh, that's one thing; if it's the first prank he's ever pulled, that's a different kettle of fish.

Regardless, if you think his intent was to amuse or entertain, you have *got* to give him a pass.  You've already made it clear that you weren't amused and it sounds like he's going to try his best to make it up to you.  If what you are in is a real marriage, it's now on you to try to make the best of it, and put your negative feelings aside.

As you get older - heavens, one day you will be as old as me, I am sorry to say - you will find that often - maybe always - there is plenty of negativity to go around.   It is not always the case that there is enough positive energy, though.  If you make it a habit to always be the source of positivity in your relationships, and to be the source of as little negativity as possible, I promise you that this habit will serve you well during the rough times, times that everyone will encounter."
"But did you do anything for him on your anniversary? Maybe you just didn't mention what you did, which is fair, but if you had nothing planned then it's kind of messed up to be mad at him for also having nothing planned."
Seems like you‚Äôre over reacting. He went through the trouble of going through with it and then felt bad enough that he‚Äôs buying you shit. 
[removed]
"Yeah, take a joke & stop taking yourself so seriously. It‚Äôs good to have a sense of humor in any aspect of life. It‚Äôs not like he‚Äôs cheating or doing anything wrong. Be kind."
This is great advice :)
"Perfect answer. 

He did a total bonehead thing. 

But it certainly wasn't up there with abuse, cheating, lying about finances, hiding an addiction. 

If you aren't up for the date tonight - and it's ok if you aren't - just be honest. ""I appreciate the gesture and I understand you truly feel bad about what happened. But I'm not quite *over* it yet and I'd like a little time to process. How about next weekend instead?""

You're allowed to still be upset *and* accept his apology. What you're saying is ""I'm not going to hold this against you and I'm going to let it go. I just can't do that on command, this instant. So let's save this for a little later when we can BOTH enjoy it and truly move on."""
"I was going to suggest couples counseling and individual counseling as a precursor to dumping him, because quite frankly he sounds abusive. /s"
">my sisters and I have always specified to our SOs to never, ever do anything like that, even as a joke.

It's not embarrassing or cheesy, it's straight up IGNORING his wife and her feelings about this.

She's said not to do it, multiple times, and he ignored that. That's a problem."
"How stupid does someone have to be to think that just because her family brings it up to LAUGH OVER, it's something ""important"" and romantic he should copy? That's absolutely ridiculous. It's also not a mixed message AT ALL to laugh when your parents tell the story but tell your partner not to do that to you. It's actually super simple: she said not to do it. That means ""don't do it."" Jesus Christ it's not that hard!"
">It wasn‚Äôt spiteful. It wasn‚Äôt mean.

Yes it was.  OP was VERY clear that he was NEVER to do that and he did it anyway.  If she says ""No surprise parties ever"" are you going to defend him throwing her one?

"
"Oooh, I like this advice: ""forgive stupid, but not selfish, mean, or spiteful behaviour""...I'm going to use this!

"
Probably because it's stupid and unromantic.
"Lots of it is it‚Äôs my parents story, part of it is it‚Äôs embarrassing to think of my dads thought process of a young guy in his 20s and part of it is just not my image of how I want things to be "
"> also have doubts that he wasn‚Äôt planning on doing something serious for you afterwards.

I love him and am willing to give him maximum benefit of the doubt but I do mean it when I say this was all he had planned 
"
"Why can't you imagine that she might mean the things she says? I would never expect my SO to copy a dumb joke from something my dad did because it's extremely lame but if there was any chance of that, I would think telling him not to would be enough. Partners should listen to one another. "
"He‚Äôs a very funny guy, I mean really great wit and I can see him just getting carried away thinking I would laugh "
"I spent a ton of time researching the exact roof rack tent he wanted to get for his truck, even down to the color and got it for him."
What does that have to do with *anything*???
Putting a lot of effort into ignoring your partner's wishes isn't a saving grace. It's actually the opposite
"Are you kidding? If this comment isn't satire, then you are incredibly out of touch. "
"I‚Äôm not going that far, I just want more advice if my expectations are out of line with reality."
"OP: ""I don't want you to do x, I will not find it funny at all.""

*does x anyways*

*OP responds exactly how she warned she would* 

Man-children: ""OMG CAN'T YOU TAKE A JOKE, JUST HAVE A SENSE OF HUMOR AND BE NICE GOD."""
"If my partner made a specific joke at my expense, on a special day, when I had *repeatedly asked them* not to, I‚Äôd be furious. I‚Äôm a sarcastic person and I love to laugh, but this was over the line. "
"It really is.

I've been married ten years, and have experienced plenty of stupid arguments and disappointments during that time. If you can't let the dumb but ultimately harmless stuff go, your relationship will turn into resentment after resentment. I get incredibly upset with my wife at times, but ultimately I remind myself that unless whatever I'm mad about is actually divorce-worthy, I need to distance myself from my initial reaction sooner rather than later, and just move on.

I do understand why you're upset, but this transgression alone doesn't strike me as divorce-worthy. Your husband has learned a valuable lesson about your expectations. I agree with the poster above...maybe plan anniversary nights together. While my wife and I have surprised each other with an evening out in the past, for most special occasions we usually just discuss options we'd both enjoy and come up with a plan together. That way nobody is disappointed. Sharing the anticipation can be just as fun as receiving a surprise."
What sounds abusive? At worst he's misguided and doesnt listen well.
"I think this is an overly dramatic reading of the  situation, and not very helpful. 

OP maybe give some thought to what I said about mixed messages, and why you feel the way you do even after he has apologized. "
Here is a problem though. very often in relationships people say one thing and mean another. He has to trust that OP means what she says and she has to be okay with him actually believing the things she says.
"What if I told you people aren't perfect?

What if I told you it's possible the husband read the situation wrong? He saw MiL pretending to be ""embarrassed"", everyone laughing about the story, and OP is laughing too when she says ""But omg don't you EVER do anything like that hahaha!!!""

Would it be reasonable to assume the husband believed OP secretly found it sweet and amusing and her admonishment not to do it wasn't really a serious boundary, in the same way that people say ""One more thing goes wrong today there is going to be a body count!"" 99.9% of people just mean they're over today and everything it has to offer. 

Because I can *easily* see a situation in which the husband thought that everyone loved this corny story so much that surely his wife would too."
My honest take on a situation isn't a defense for anyone. It is an opinion. Yours differs. Ok then. 
"> Lots of it is it‚Äôs my parents story, 

Are you embarrassed by your parents?

>part of it is just not my image of how I want things to be

Isn't the fact that it was supposed to be a joke acknowledging the fact that it isnt actually like that though? "
"Why was it just up to him to plan something? 

Seriously, move on. This is not a big deal. You‚Äôre both going to do dumb stuff that needs forgiving if you plan to be together for decades. "
"Since your anniversary is a shared special day for the two of you, I would recommend that you and your husband discuss what you are going to do ahead of time. For my wife and I's first year anniversary we went to a resort in Scottsdale for a few days. For our five year we went to France. Last year we went back to the town we got married in and spent the weekend. 

We don't get each other gifts, but plan things to do together. Gifts for us are for things like birthday and Christmas. That way we aren't putting so much pressure on our anniversary to surprise each other only to be disappointed. 

Your husband was trying to do something he thought (and you obviously did not) was sentimental and special. You bought him something completely unsentimental. 

In the future, plan things together either by doing a nice dinner, getting out of town for a few days, or buying a nice big gift for both of you to enjoy. "
I was curious what she got him to see what her level of expectation that he would do for her was. 
"There's a belief that floats around sometimes, that women never give men gifts. It's complete BS, but it will get brought up in every one of these threads. "
"No but attempting to make up for it with dinner and shopping, is. "
"Was it the /r/relationships holy trinity of get counseling, break up, and ""he's abusive""?"
"Wow that's pretty rude, i just put more importance in trust in relationships than you, don't have to be so rude. "
"Ugh, why is this so common?! If I had a dollar every time it happened to me I would be rich."
That is some top advice here üëèüèª
"The ""/s"" symbols conveys the message is sarcastic; /u/flapface was being sarcastic about the husband being abusive."
The /s means sarcasm. 
"> saying ‚Äòdon‚Äôt ever do that‚Äô. You have to admit, it‚Äôs a mixed message

How, in any universe, is ""Do not do that"" a mixed message?"
I think top comment of this thread hit the nail on the head that when this is brought up we are all laughing so my admonitions to not do the chicken thing may have been seen in that light.0 
That is completely fair. 
"Of course people aren't perfect. But unless OP has a history of saying things and expecting the opposite, there is no reason to think that this is the *one* thing she isn't serious about.

This isn't divorce worthy, but it did expressly go against something OP had clearly said on more than one occasion, and it's not okay to disregard things your partner says like that. "
Aren‚Äôt all girls embarrassed by thier parents at some point? I love them but they are parents.
"I did plan something, I spent several weeks researching What I thought was the perfect gift "
"He‚Äôs not a very sentimental person (goes without saying I guess) And this is something he‚Äôd been talking about forever so I thought it was nice, I don‚Äôt know I can see your point too. I‚Äôm just a little upset by all this. I‚Äôll get over it for sure but it‚Äôs not what I imagined our first anniversary to be."
It........ doesn't work that way? When someone TELLS you they don't want something then THAT **IS** THE EXPECTATION. Her expectation was literally **anything except this one very specific thing**. Why the hell is that so hard for some people?
"You can't make up for everything. Sometimes people want you to listen to something they've made crystal clear, instead of asking for forgiveness after the fact."
We could split it amongst all these commenters and still be rich. 
"""Don't do that"" combined with happily exalting the story is a mixed message.

It's obvious if you are capable of reading a paragraph."
"Perhaps read everything I wrote; it was very obvious.  

I get where you are coming from and of course you are entitled to your opinion. I personally just don‚Äôt think it is very helpful or constructive.  But if it work for you, you do you. "
"On first reading, I took the ""don't ever repeat the story"" as meaning ""don't repeat the story outside the family,"" that is, don't tell it to outsiders. I didn't actually realise OP meant ""don't repeat the actual event even as a joke"" until I re-read it with the benefit of context. I am not convinced the husband understood she specifically objected."
"My grandmom tells us not clean up our plates after she cooks us dinner. 

What would *you* do?"
Well I guess this is a good opportunity to discuss gifts and expectations going forward. My husband and I plan our anniversaries together and have a basic price guide on gifts. It‚Äôs something we worked out together over the first few years of our relationship. 
"Listen, I understand that you told him not to do something and he foolishly did exactly that. You obviously have a right to your feelings and to be upset. In the future, to avoid any disappointment on your anniversary, my recommendation would be to discuss the plans for both of you in advance. That way there is no disappointment and you can likely do something way more special than if you surprise each other with gifts. 

In addition to the mini vacations that my wife and I took on our anniversaries, one year we bought ourselves a nice antique credenza. It was our first non-Ikea, non-particle board piece and we still really enjoy it. "
You are very good at italics and bolding. 
"Yes, but it‚Äôs a relatively small issue in the big picture  and hardly a reason to end a marriage over. Sometimes you have to pick your battles and move on."
"No you can't make up for everything, but there are much worse and bigger things to get worked up over than this..I would recommend talking it out and making it clear why it caused her to be upset but then get over it and try to not let it ruin their new plans."
But obviously anyone could see she was distinguishing between her parents' relationship and her own. You're allowed to laugh over something they did and still.not want it for yourself. She told him no. That actually means no.
"ALWAYS go with the words.  ALWAYS.  

This is how rapists and their apologists excuse rape:  ""I didn't think she meant ""no"" when she said ""no"" because she was smiling.""  ""She said ""no,"" but I knew she wasn't really serious, I knew she was just playing a game.""  ""She didn't actually say ""no"" and she was alone with me, so clearly she wanted it.""

Etc.

This is fucking serious.  It is maddening because women are always being criticized for not using our words in precisely the right way to be understood by the other half of the population, and when we DO use them, clearly and unambiguously?  We are still somehow to blame when a man ignores us and does whatever he wants anyway.

So.  If you told your SO that there were certain things that you wanted for a special occasion, and other things that you absolutely did not want happening, you would be fine with not being listened to?  Let's say you want a birthday dinner at a French restaurant, followed by a nice walk in a picturesque part of the city and, oh, a couple episodes of *Archer* when you get home.

Your SO gives you pizza at Chucky Cheese, no lovely stroll and a grade-B horror film he rented on a lark.  You hate horror films and they know that.  Except they say that they didn't think you were *serious,* all those times that you said, ""I don't like horror films.""  Nor was the fact that you refused to watch them apparently enough of a hint.

No.  This is a case of your SO having an idea of what you *should* want because *they* want it.  The OP's husband probably would've been *thrilled* if she had shown up in dirty work clothes, a basket of KFC in one hand and a new box of condoms in the other:  ergo, *she* will also be thrilled!

So...why bother to communicate if people just insist that you're sending ""mixed messages"" because they don't, for whatever reason, want to believe what you are saying?"
"I read it. Something can be a fun family story and also be something you should not do. 

If my SO disregarded me specifically saying not to do something, and did it anyway claiming that because I talk about it, I'd be more pissed. It's not a difficult concept to understand that if someone expressly says not to do something, you don't do it. "
Really? Those are not comparable situations.
No one said anything about ending the marriage. 
"Because tone and body language play a big role in our communicating regardless of the specific words we use. My boyfriend and i say all sorts of playfully mean stuff to each other while laughing our asses off. Doesn't mean we should take the words out of the context of everything else.  

OP's boyfriend fucked up, he realizes, he's trying to make it right "
Well not everyone would be more pissed.  To each their own. 
"You asked how it would be possible for someone to say ""DO NOT DO THAT"" and their meaning be unclear. 

I gave you an example of someone saying not to do something, and their meaning is unclear. 

Do you understand now?"
"I realize that but if you can‚Äôt forgive someone then what is the point of continuing a marriage? 
You can‚Äôt stay with someone your perpetually mad at. The only choice is to move on. "
"There is a big difference between ""do not do something"" when it comes to clearing a plate and ""do not do something"" you have been told repeatedly not to do. 

A grandmother saying 'don't clean your plate' is someone following a social convention. "
"> There is a big difference between ""do not do something"" when it comes to clearing a plate and ""do not do something"" you have been told repeatedly not to do.
 
My grandmother repeatedly tells me not the clean my plate, Why do you think *repeatedly* telling someone makes a difference here?

>A grandmother saying 'don't clean your plate' is someone following a social convention.

Is that the *only* social convention you are aware of?"
"> Is that the only social convention you are aware of?

Apparently so.  Apologists will tie themselves into allllllllll kinds of knots to defend their position.  How much would you wager that she's a Cool Girl?"
"This is a very sweet post. Maybe you could let her know that you are very excited about having sex her, even though you feel nervous/not ready for it at the moment, and that you're really happy that when you do feel ready, it'll be with someone you feel close to and care about. I hope it goes well :)"
You've said your piece. She told you she feels embarassed and doesn't really want to talk about it further. Dont text/talk about it anymore unless she brings it up. Just move on to being together like you normally would. It will blow over if you just treat her normally.
"YES. Quit the texting. It doesn‚Äôt help. 

In person is best.  I like the gift idea too.  Also making sure she knows you want her but not quite ready. "
"Stop doing this over text. If it feels hard to have these conversations in person, write down what you want to say and read it to the partner."
"That's pretty dang cute. It's hard figuring shit out and becoming an adult. She's being overly hard on herself. Get her a cute little present and leave it for her with a note that says something like ""You're a super rad person, don't be hard on yourself. I love/<3 you"". I'm in my 30s and Kinder Eggs make anything better. 

Also sex is way over rated. Sure it's fun, but so are a lot of things in life. And it's the one fun thing that is weirdly personal, totally wait until you're sure you're ready. Do all the other things in life that are also fun and don't include being in or having a part of someone's body inside of you."
"First of all I‚Äôd sit down with her and talk, quit with all the texting. "
I've been in your exact situation before. Both of you shouldn't feel bad about what happened and good on you for communicating with her about it! She may feel a mix of rejection and guilt but I think you may need to simply try to put the incident in the past. Just treat her as you normally would and show her that nothing has changed. If she has trouble getting over it you could mention that you want to wait for a time in the future you feel will be more special and that you are both ready.
Just act like everything's normal and stop bringing it up! 
"I think it‚Äôs pretty common for young girls to feel like boys their age should always be more sexually excited than they are, and often they also are made to feel weird for having sexual desires at all, so together that can make situations like this really jarring and upsetting for a girl like your GF. She probably feels a lot of conflicting things right now, but I think it‚Äôs a really good sign that she was willing to express those feelings to you and that you have been doing your best to reassure her that she did nothing wrong. I think the best thing you can do now is just keep acting the same way you always would - giving her attention and love, and in time she will get over it. 

Both of you sound like mature, caring partners for your age, so keep doing what you are doing! It‚Äôs really refreshing to see posts like this one on this sub "
"Tell her that what she did, as far as she went, was safe, good, and fun--if you liked it. If you really liked it, ask her to do it all over again. When you are ready for sex, you will make that move; until then, she needs to know she hasn't crossed any lines, and actually gave you an excellent time!"
"Well, maybe just sweet, completely non-sexual affection would be good. Maybe she doesn't feel bad because you rejected her, but she feels bad because when the arousal wore off she realized she isn't ready yet either. In that case, telling her that what she did was okay might not be too helpful, because she herself feels it wasn't okay and it's not about you or what you did, but about how she feels about what she tried to do in a careless moment.  
So talk about it when you can, so you can clear things up, and in the meantime give her whatever kind of affection she responds best to, like hugs or holding her hand or kissing her cheek..."
Sometimes in relationships you each said your thing and you just have to give it time.  It‚Äôs an important relationship skill even adults don‚Äôt do well most of the time.
"I think reassure her in person you are attracted to her and maybe prove it if you're comfortable by messing around to the point you feel would be comfortable and sweet. Explain you didn't feel pressured by her and you are happy she was into it and you are also into it and her but you want to make sure when you do it you are ready so that it's really great. Everyone moves at different sexual paces and that okay.

If it continues to be a problem ask her why. Maybe it's because there is a social expectation for men to be more aggressive or always want it so maybe she feels bad for being the female and the aggressor and being ""turned down"" and feels creepy and aggressive. Ask her if so to look at it in reverse and if it was a guy who wanted to have sex and the girl was into it but wanted to wait would she think less of the guy? Probably not.

Also maybe just let it be awkward and let it move on naturally. Sometimes people feel embarrassed and that's ok. You sound like a great guy."
"I think other comments here have probably covered your main question - but I do feel like I ought to say one thing in particular: avoid communicating about important things by text if possible, if you can't do it in person then at least call her. It's way, *waaaaay* too easy to have misunderstandings or give the wrong impression over text, and when it comes to your relationship it's important to communicate effectively."
That's good. Keep it that way buddy. Cross that bridge when the time is right because sex is very special and people know it but they give in to their bodily needs.
"Honestly good for you for knowing you weren‚Äôt ready and not rushing into it! Your girlfriend is probably just feeling a bit embarrassed and insecure about the whole thing. No real tips for how to make her feel better, but you might have to be the one to make the first move for a little bit because she‚Äôll probably shy away from that for awhile. "
"I was in your girlfriend's shoes when I was 16 and my boyfriend was 17. I wanted to have sex but he reacted the same way, and then I reacted the same as your girlfriend. The best way to make her feel better is to have sex with her, but make it super special, like light candles and get her flowers, etc. Make it seem like you wanted the first time to be ""perfect,"" so that she'll feel like you really value her and there was a reason you made her wait this long.

If you can't have sex with her yet, you really need to talk to her in person and tell her that you aren't ready and you're waiting, because losing your virginity is important to you and you know that the first time is something you'll remember forever.

I do advise that when you do finally have sex, you make it special, like light candles and tell her she's beautiful and you love her, because this will be something you both remember forever, and you both deserve for it to be special. Like definitely try not to be drunk or on drugs for your first time, this is something you truly deserve as a human to remember as special.

I'm 36 now and still remember when I lost my virginity. My boyfriend made me wait and said he wanted it to be special but we ended up doing it haphazardly and quickly while watching Full House. I remember this moment and will never forget it, and it makes me grimace and laugh when I think back. I wish the moment were more special, the TV off, lights dimmed, etc. I think most teenagers experience losing their virginities the same way I did, so it isn't the end of the world if that's how it happens.

Hope this helped a little bit..."

"Additionally, make sure you get comfortable with having that conversation in person instead of non-verbally simply not escalating it. It stands to reason that some people would take a lack of progression without a reason in a comfortable scenario like this personally.

Apparently saying sex is overrated will get you downvoted to all hell on reddit. I guess it's not sex positive or something even though it is a completely legitimate experience for many people. And now I'm going to get downvoted for generalizing people on reddit.
Did you forget the /s? This is a kid we‚Äôre talking about. A kid who was in-tune with himself enough to know what he was and was not comfortable with. If only more kids could do that. I commend him for stopping when he felt uncomfortable.

Yeah, if you're not ready to TALK about sex, you're not ready to HAVE sex."
Meh. Look at the overall tone on here. If you arent being mean and getting downvoted you just chaffed the Reddit grain. Who gives a flying fuck if an anonymous internet cesspool judges you. 
"no /s. Yes, he is a kid, and he needs to grow up.  And here's the thing... If he really knew what he was and wasn't comfortable with, there's be no post. For example, if fucking wasn't compatible with his religion, he'd say no and be righteous about it. He wouldn't be wondering if he did the wrong thing or handled things improperly. He needs to focus on himself and stop worrying about some girl who clearly has no respect for him now. "

"Does your sister want you to get her permission before giving gifts? That‚Äôs literally the only way to avoid this again. The toys you bought aren‚Äôt housecleaning sets, princess,, etc, so any gender references are inferred by oneself."
"> I personally think they're only gender-specific if you yourself are sexist

I agree with you on this 100&#37;. I don't see how either of these toys would be gender specific and as you said the kids share toys anyway. Easiest way to avoid her criticism is to ask her what sort of presents she thinks is appropriate for them."
">I asked her what she meant, and she told me that both the toys seemed to be aimed at a particular gender, and weren't gender neutral.

Did she say which gender she thought they were aimed at?  Did she both as boy toys, girl toys or one each?   I'm with you, I can't see any issue with your choice of gifts.

>the Star Wars Millennium Falcon, with three action figures inside: a man, a woman, and a robot.

Except of course the issue of having the Millennium Falcon without Chewy!!!  How dare they not include him in the action figures!  :)"
"Disclaimer: I don't agree with your sister. I'm a parent myself and I struggle with knowing what gender neutral toys even are. 

However, she didn't *lecture* you; she told you a gift-giving boundary for her kids. 

You should ask her if she's okay with you bringing gifts in general, and if so, how often. For example, I really appreciate the kindness behind it, but don't like my daughter to get too many gifts, because of limited space, don't want her to get spoiled, want her to learn to be bored at times, etc.

Then, if she's okay with gifts, ask her specifically what a gender neutral gift is, and/or have her make you a wish list of some kind. I make an Amazon wish list for my kiddo every year for Christmas, so people can get her things she needs or wants. But I only give it out upon request, because I don't wanna be a present-grubber."
"I don‚Äôt agree with your sister about the toys. That said, it sound like she handled it really well ‚Äî she thanked you for bringing gifts and told you her parenting preference without making a big deal. I wish all parents could assert their views that way, no matter how extreme or unreasonable those views may seem to us."
"Is it a big deal? No, your sister is over-reacting. But they are her kids, and people get heated when people who aren't the parent of the child seem to ""know better"" and go against the parents wishes. Even if you're right.  Sometimes it's better not to sweat the small stuff and go along with it, it's not worth fighting over. Save your anger for something that really matters."
"Auntie here, my nephew has Amazon lists. I buy off those lists (Star Wars, Legos, robots, etc). My niece loves all things colorful, girly, artsy, sparkly, etc. Who the fudge cares what the kids get, the kids will pick what they like (I'm all about not labeling toys boy or girl NOR do I think it's appropriate to place gender politics on toys that kids willingly pick). You're a good uncle, don't let her get you down."
"I‚Äôd clarify that you didn‚Äôt know either toy was gender-roled and ask her if she could teach you about what things to look out for in the future when buying gifts for them because you don‚Äôt want to inadvertently buy them things she‚Äôs not comfortable with them having. It doesn‚Äôt sound like either toy was marketed toward either gender, as both franchises are pretty popular with all kinds of people. But they‚Äôre her kids, it‚Äôs harmless, and it doesn‚Äôt sound like she made a big deal of it so I wouldn‚Äôt let it bother you. "
"Your sister is a little nuts here but I am afraid that since they are her children you need to just nod and say you understand.  Don't admit guilt, just say you understand what she is saying.  

Next time when you want to give a gift you should stick to money.  However, if you live in the USA she might find that sexist since all the banknotes have males on them.../s"
"They are her kids, so you should respect her beliefs here, even if she is bat-shit crazy. "
"Those are like the least gendered children's toys I can imagine. Unless, of course, you're a misogynist who thinks Star Wars isn't for girls (and is therefore a ""boy"" present). 

So yeah...I kind of agree that your sister is the one who's being sexist here. My son loves Star Wars and The Incredibles (honestly, more so the Incredibles). His girl friends also love Star Wars and The Incredibles. My wife and I both love Star Wars...and the Incredibles!

Come to think of it, who *doesn't* love Star Wars and The Incredibles?"
Did you hand the girl the Incredibles toy?
"You don't actually say what the toys were - or why your sister believed them to be gender-specific - thus it's hard to see what the issue was or if she was right, it seems unlikely anyone would kick up such a fuss unless there was something more to this than them just being Star Wars and  Incredibles 2 toys. Either way try to understand and respect her view."
"If it's not a life altering issue like being anti-vaccination, then as you pointed out, she's the mother."
"i don't think she's necessarily over-reacting, but it seems like a poorly communicated request. even if neither of those toys are super gender-specific, action figures and the like are decidedly more ""boyish"" to society at large. and her kids are getting to an age where they're learning about gender stereotypes and will be influenced and judged by them, regardless of how they are parented. she may be concerned that with both kids in school and spending more time with other adults and with peers, they will pick up on some of the more pervasive gender stereotypes that might lead to spats (eg, after spending all day playing with other 5 year olds, little bro says, ""big sister can't play with that, Star Wars is for BOYS. she needs to play with a girl toy). i think it's likely that your sister is trying to stave that off as much as she can, and the easiest way to do that is to stick with toys that are harder to associate with either gender. maybe something like doctor/veterinarian kits, playing cards, puzzles, bubbles, coloring/sticker books, pretend play stuff, etc. 

i understand why you feel taken aback by her request, but it doesn't seem like she raised a big stink about it, and i can understand her position as well.
"
"Personally I believe that not enforcing gender roles also comes with the caveat that children should have choice and also that denigrating stereotypically feminine roles or toys with any gender child is inherently misogynistic because it looks down upon stereotypically feminine roles/toys/beliefs. I think the way you presented them gives them choice and they share them anyways. 

The toys that you chose, especially the Incredibles toy (after part of the Star Wars fandom‚Äôs treatment of Kelly Tran - but that‚Äôs neither here nor there) are pretty gender neutral but I don‚Äôt think this is the issue. 

Unfortunately since the kiddos are your sister‚Äôs, it might be best to defer to her and maybe give her a heads up as to what you might bring or what she thinks is appropriate for them. She might think something is enforcing stereotypical gender roles that the good majority thinks is gender neutral or vice versa. You‚Äôll never know and if you want to err on the side of caution, ask first."
She's the one who made this about gender. You did good. 
"""Sis, I didn't mean to get your kids gendered toys. I'm sorry that my presents didn't fit your parenting plan and I 100&#37; want to keep in line with your choices as their mother. That being said, I'm genuinely not seeing what you mean with regards to the specific toys I brought. Because I still don't get it, I'm not confident I can choose toys you'll approve of in the future. Would you mind doing up a wishlist for next time, and I'll pick from that?"""
"While I don‚Äôt agree with your sister I think it couldn‚Äôt hurt to call her up, tell her it‚Äôs been on your mind, and ask for specifics. Obvs you‚Äôd like to respect her wishes but you actually need to know what to respect. The toys seem gender neutral to you (and us!) so she must be perceiving it differently and you‚Äôre not a mind reader.  "
"If anything, I'd say you were going against gender norms...      
Between the two sets, I'd imagine the older one of the two being more drawn to the Star Wars set.  So that would go to he niece.      

I'm guessing your sister is thinking in really generic terms in that the more cartoony one is therefore more girly (doesn't actually make sense, but it's the only thought process I can figure here).  Or just the ""Star Wars is for dudes"" is still a strong impression in her mind?     

The only thing I have to say on handling the matter, is maybe to get a list from your sister on stuff to avoid/etc.  Ask her for details because you *legitimately* are not sure why the toys you bought weren't ideal.  Keep an eye on your tone, maybe practice privately to see how it sounds, but just approach it in that you want to understand where she's coming from.     

Either she'll be able to help you understand where she's coming from (better than any of us, off the bat) or she'll not really have an explanation and hopefully realize she's the one with an outdated mindset on this one."
"It sounds like she thinks those are boy toys and that's the gender demographic since action figures are usually a ""boy toy"". 

Have there been any other comments about her daughter playing with boy toys? I wonder if she's worried her girl likes boy toys or that her boy likes boy toys? 

Unfortunately, there's not a whole lot you can do since she's the parent and doesn't seem to be being unreasonable, though opinionated. You could try talking with her and clarifying what her issue is, but she gets to decide what her kids play with.... "
"I feel like she's making a big deal outta nothing. I mean look, if the boy chooses a 'boys' toy for himself, or the girl choose a girls toy for her self - is she going to prohibit that? When I was a kid my bionicles liked to look after my plastic animals - kids will make their toys do whatever they want, a boys toy can be played with to role play, barbies can have bloody deathmatches... I guess if you think too much about it it can be hard to tell whos for who :P

But that's besides the point, clearly she's upset you gave them such girly toys! after all Rey is the star in the current star wars films, and Helen is kicking ass in the incredible 2! Surely she's just annoyed the boy was going to feel left out! /s

She's assigned gender roles to the toys herself, they're just little plastic people ... the can literally do anything and be anyone in the land of the childrens play... it's totally inoffensive. 

I guess in the future you'll have to give her a heads up about gifts and get the ok. She went about it in an ok way, but really, the problem is the toys really aren't gendered. But hey, maybe to clear up the current problem, take everyone - including her - to see the incredibles. She might realise its basically... everyone kicks ass, not just dudes. (I'm gonna be real I'm going off the first one, the second one JUST released in my country, pls no spoilers)"
"There are a lot of studies about this subject.  Do research.  Read up.  If you still feel that your sister's views are incorrect, have a discussion with her about it.  This is something you should be able to talk about rationally.  I can't see why she'd protest--unless she's afraid of being proven wrong.  "
"People who get so angry when people follow gender stereotypes are as annoying as the people who expect everyone to. 

"
Maybe she's just having a rough week and decided to take it out on you.
""" I personally think they're only gender-specific if you yourself are sexist, but I didn't tell my sister that. ""

You're right. Tell her that. She's the one enforcing roles on things."
">I personally think they're only gender-specific if you yourself are sexist

This is where you are mistaken. It's like saying that you only see skin color if you're racist. 

I don't know exactly what is in your sister's head, but if someone gave my kids only action figures whose job it is to fight against others, I would also think they were not gender-neutral. And if it seemed important enough to me to bring it up to my otherwise considerate, kid-loving uncle, I would hope he would trust me on this and not turn around and call me a sexist. "
"I'm curious who the man in the falcon is, if not chewie.

Finn maybe? But that's lame, bring back the Wookies"
"This is a good idea!

Personally, I'm with you OP that I don't see how either of these is gendered and would have been happy if my brother or sister gave them to my daughter.

But you're probably not going to win this one defending your choices if your sister is quite particular, and the only fool-proof plan is to work from a list. "
"I wonder if something happened in particular that OP‚Äôs sister is reacting to.  The kids are old enough now that they are learning stuff from their peers, and they might be bringing home gender ideas that make mom uncomfortable.  Since mom wasn‚Äôt hypersensitive to gender stuff before, I wonder if she‚Äôs reacting to something specific.  OP might be able to gently ask about that by mentioning that this seems like a new approach toward the children‚Äôs toys and ask about the thought process behind it.  Understanding where mom is coming from will probably help OP feel more confident that he can operate within that boundary, and after hearing the reasoning, OP might even agree with mom‚Äôs new approach.  "
"I have them the gifts the same way I always do: I hold them out, and each kid picks the one he or she likes to play with first. It's not that they're saying ""this is mine,"" but just that they will play with that one first before inevitably sharing it later."
"She did, its in her edit. "
">I don't know exactly what is in your sister's head, but if someone gave my kids only action figures whose job it is to fight against others, I would also think they were not gender-neutral. 

Can you clarify this statement? How is fighting a gender specific activity?"
"No, in this specific case I disagree. It was an incredibles toy and a star wars toy. Those are not aimed at either gender ( you could have made the argument for Star wars in the 80s, but modern star wars has a female protagonist so..)
And I think seeing it that way shows that you're perspective is antiquated. Most studios are really careful about this stuff anyway nowadays. Even Disney ""princess"" movies are made fairly neutral. 

Regardless, if there aren't any real gender roles, than toys CANT be anything but neutral, logically... "
"I was gifted Barbies from my female cousins and pretended they were Super Saiyans (hey, they were blonde and had blue eyes!) and had to fight evil guys. Why an action figure would equal fighting? Heck, why would it be wrong for a little girl to play with a ""boyish"" toy to fight? There are women in the police and the army, this is not the 19th century."
"Might have been Han, Qi'ra, and the new droid from the Han Solo movie. Still rude to leave out Chewie :( "
"We bought my daughter one a few years ago that sounds similar to what op described but it had han solo, r2d2 and chewie.

Chewie is her favorite"
Exactly. I have two female members of my family who are proudly serving our country in the military. I also have a sister in law who is an amateur kick boxer.  Women can be powerful warriors. 
"One thing to consider is that some people seem to think toys are always 'boy's toys' unless they're very obviously marketed as 'girl's toys'(including stuff you'd think is neutral, like legos). I think that train of thought is ridiculous, but there are people who actually believe it.

You'd *hope* someone concerned about overly gender-specific toys wouldn't think like that, but it's a possibility."
Is this what this world is coming to üò©
"I'm gonna guess Finn, Rey, and BB8 because that's who they have as the crew in one of the Galaxy of Heroes Falcons (diff iterations available)"
"Oooh I forgot about the new movie lol.

Yikes, I can't believe I completely forgot that film existed. That definitely makes sense"
"Tbh if Chewie isn't your favourite you don't deserve a millennium falcon toy, he's quite clearly the best character."
"I mean, it‚Äôs not like you‚Äôre the first person to get sloppy drunk at a baseball game.  

THAT SAID, I agree with a poster above who said to lie low.  Especially since you‚Äôre not totally sure of who saw what.  Apology donuts (while delicious) may as well come with a flashing sign that says: hey guys guess who has two thumbs and totally fucked up?? It‚Äôs me!

If someone has the nerve to say something do your best to laugh it off while still looking properly abashed (shouldn‚Äôt be hard since you ARE embarrassed) and just sorta be like ‚Äúyeah, that def wasn‚Äôt my finest moment. Won‚Äôt be pulling that one again!‚Äù and, if necessary, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry you had to see that.‚Äù 

It‚Äôll be okay.  I know you‚Äôre mortified and I get it but it sounds like it‚Äôll be all right in time.  For now, just keep your head down, do your work, and the rumor mill will eventually produce all new drama that doesn‚Äôt concern you at all.  

Also like.  Consider NOT drinking at professional outings anymore.  Even off the clock fun ones like baseball games.  "
"Bring donuts/bagels/some kind of snack when you go into work tomorrow. People usually focus on free food rather than what happened. If anyone mentions it, just laugh and say, ""Woo, yeah, that was a mistake. Sorry if you had to witness that.""

"Honestly, my reactions to alcohol on a low-carb/keto diet were one of the main reasons I stopped low-carbing. They were EXTREME. 

I do wish you the best of luck navigating the workplace. Most likely it will be worse this week and with consistent, top-notch behavior on your part and time  it will dissipate. "
"Try not to be too embarrassed, everyone has behaved inappropriately at some point in their life. Probably apologise, say youve never had a reaction like that before & most importantly, just dont do it again! "
"Anybody who brags about their tolerance to alcohol by saying they can do ten shots of vodka, no problem really probably needs to quit drinking.  Regardless, you had FIVE drinks at a WORK EVENT.  

You don't seem to understand the concept of ""responsible drinking"".  It's entirely possibly there's a physical underlying effect like diabetes or heat stroke or whatever excuse you want to put on it, but the fact remains: 

You had FIVE drinks at a work event.  Re-evaluate your relationship with alcohol. "
"Hey so I do drink enough to tell you that wine before beer does not mix AT ALL. I‚Äôve had one glass of wine before and a beer afterwards and was feeling terrible. Always remember ‚Äúbeer before wine you‚Äôre gonna be fine, wine before beer you‚Äôre gonna feel queer‚Äù 

The heat probably added to you feeling sick. If you‚Äôre drinking and it‚Äôs hot out, try to only stick to one type of drink and make it a light drink. White wine or a light beer is perfect imo. 

You say you don‚Äôt drink often so this is actually understandable to me. Your tolerance isn‚Äôt as high as it was in college. That‚Äôs ok. 

It‚Äôs understandable you‚Äôre embarrassed and don‚Äôt want to face anyone at work but take it from me, just pretend nothing even happened. If someone brings it up don‚Äôt entertain them on it. It‚Äôs just best to not even talk about it and no one else will hopefully. You may have the one or two that try to be like ‚Äúomg you were so.....‚Äù just keep it short with a ‚Äúyeah ik haha‚Äù and keep it pushing.

"So this actually happened to me about a year ago. I was doing some army training and the team I was working with all went out for beers at the bar on base as a team bonding event one night. I didn‚Äôt even drink THAT much beer. But for some reason I got extremely drunk. It was super weird and unlike me because I never get drunk like that off the amount of beer I drank that night. The weird thing is that, it happened to a few of the other guys I was with too. I didn‚Äôt throw up, but after a certain point, my memory gets really fuzzy and I had to be escorted back to the building I was staying in. I have no explanation for what happened that night. It was almost like I was roofied, but I know that wasn‚Äôt the case. It was kinda embarrassing because I didn‚Äôt even know any of these people. I didn‚Äôt get in trouble or anything. It was kinda awkward for the next few days and some of the guys made fun of me. But overall it wasn‚Äôt a big deal. 

Try not to stress over it. Stuff happens. Sometime the body just reacts strange. "
"- Bring in free food 
> Make sure there are enough bagels or donuts for people to have two if they wanted. This will give you kudos. 
- If someone makes a joke about drinking, change it to a ""Baseball focused joke."" 
> You don't want to joke about being drunk at all. People probably know what happened, but it looks bad if you continue that rumor up. ""Baseball is just too much for me."" 
- Get a visa debit card for like twenty bucks and see if you can't figure out who the family you vomited on. Give them the card and apologize for throwing up on them."
"Did you recently start taking any new medications? I started Wellbutrin and my shrink didn‚Äôt warn me about how it interacts with alcohol - I had two beers and got blackout drunk. You definitely drank too much for a work event, but it seems weird that you blacked out and needed an EMT for five glasses of wine. "
"Hey OP, I think you got some great advice here. Have we not all been in an emberassing situation where we just want to erase our memory. I know I have been last week. Shame is real. 

The one thing I agree with people is, even if some people lost some respect for you, it‚Äôs one of the things if you show the right attitude and don‚Äôt do it again, should be fine. If I were you I would consider not saying anything about low blood sugar or heat strokes or diets, as sometimes, even if it‚Äôs valid, it may just seem like you don‚Äôt accept responsibility. Sometimes the best way to take something is quietly, bear through it and come out of it.

The one thing you should absolutely not take lightly or make jokes about is if (I‚Äôm not sure I understood correctly) you really threw up on a coworkers family. If I went somewherewith my family and some drunk lady threw up all over my kids, that‚Äôd be a problem, that‚Äôs not easily shaken off (if at all) and the coworker and their friends might very well not become your best friends in the future. Don‚Äôt joke about that or seem like you take that lightly. That‚Äôd be very upsetting. That‚Äôs a part where you really should apologize and maybe do something nice for them (voucher for a park/ swimming pool/ zoo?). 

I think you can come out of this gracefully. Take responsibility. One way or the other it‚Äôll pass. Best wishes. "
"Shit happens. You've learned not to drink so much at a work outing (especially since you seem to only have a few drinks per month, let alone in a short timespan). Honestly I wouldn't bring it up at all. Yeah it sucks that it happened and is embarrassing, but you have to remember that everyone in the office has their own lives, and if they did see it, probably hasn't even thought of it again. Even if they do bring it up, it would be weird, uncomfortable and unprofessional of them to even mention it to you. Just make sure you look well rested and happy (aka not hungover) and go on with your day. It may be the #1 thing on your mind, but I can guarantee it's not on everyone else's"
"And THAT'S why, you don't (over) drink around coworkers.

It sucks.  You screwed up but... Shit happens.  Take it as a life lesson."
"I agree that you should find out who the family is, because apologizing to them could convince the employee they were with not to talk to HR, if they were considering it. That would be my priority. Pull whatever coworker you're closest with that was at the game aside and ask them if they know who it was because you want to apologize (if they don't, tell them to please let you know if they do find out, and consider asking 1-2 more people, particularly if the office is generally pretty chilled out).

I like the idea of giving them one of those Visa gift cards (""for any cleaning or inconvenience"") if you did indeed throw up on them, or maybe tickets to another game if you can afford it. I think having this conversation will make you feel a LOT better. Those are the only people you really need to talk to, everyone else will just have something to gossip about for a day or two. Don't bring donuts, don't be too jokey. It'll blow over."
"You have a problem with alcohol, chief. The way you said it makes me think the people around you have probably normalized this, but ten shots is not normal, that is a metric fuckton. I went out the other night and had three shots in addition to probably a beer and a half and I was fucked up. And I drink fairly moderately on a regular basis - it would never cross my mind that 10 shots is an acceptable or reasonable thing to do. 

(Four glasses of wine is an entire bottle, and you didn't stop drinking even after that. Maybe not because you couldn't control yourself or because you wanted more buzz, purely because *you were at a work function and your priority should have been to ensure you did not get uncontrollably drunk.* You should have been watching your drinking for that reason alone. I don't know why no one else is pointing this out, but you have a serious problem. What you did is not ok and the solution is not in ""how do I paper over my alcohol abuse now that it's almost caused me to lose my job"". Which... if ever there were a warning sign for full blown alcoholism, it's putting your job in danger. These responses are kind of appalling.)"
"I had a stomach bug hit me while I was drinking at a wedding a couple weeks ago and all the sudden I went from having a fun time to throwing up incoherent everywhere, which is not my norm at all. It was embarrassing, especially because there was an underlying medical thing and it wasn‚Äôt just the drinking, but of course no one would know that. 

That being said, I just let bygones be bygones. I might mention in the future if someone brings it up that I was actually sick, but like others said most repentant actions will just highlight that you got wasted at an event. If anyone says something, I‚Äôd make a lighthearted joke (‚ÄúI guess you can‚Äôt take me out to the ball game‚Äù) and say it might be related to an issue with blood sugar that you‚Äôre getting checked out. "
"You‚Äôre a young woman who drank an entire bottle of wine, plus a beer, in only a couple of hours. That‚Äôs A LOT of alcohol. You drank too much, in too short a time, and got wasted at a *work event*. You did a stupid thing and I‚Äôm not going to sugar coat that for you. 

I‚Äôm a little younger than you, only 24, but I‚Äôve noticed that a lot of people our age are clueless when it comes to professional things. *If* you ever decide to drink at any type of work function, have one drink with a glass of water. THAT‚ÄôS IT. Sip on it slowly and make it last. The goal is not to get buzzed, tipsy, or drunk at all. Sometimes having a drink is just a social thing and you have to roll with it at a work event. 

I‚Äôd be prepared to face some kind of consequence back at work. It may not happen, but it very well could. Let this be a learning experience for you and any other young person who reads this. "
"How long did the game last? If you threw up around the eighth inning how can you be sure it wasn‚Äôt heat or something else you ate causing that? Unless you were being crazy belligerent, which your fam probably would have told you, your coworkers might not even think it had anything to do with your drinking."
"If you were at a baseball game in the states (I assume) I‚Äôm sure the heat didn‚Äôt help as well. You might have been dehydrated after drinking all that alcohol. This stuff happens, I would lie low or laugh it off if someone brings it up. Be a little self deprecating too, people find honor in humility."
"I don‚Äôt think this sounds normal. ‚ÄúGoing in and out of consciousness‚Äù and not remembering a single thing sounds and bit weird, especially since you have a higher tolerance. Are you sure that your drink wasn‚Äôt spiked with anything else? If it wasn‚Äôt then it could be related to the heat or your blood sugar.  

If anyone asks at work I would make a joke out of it and not get too embarrassed. It happens to the best of us sometimes. "
"Dude, nearly every adult had gotten sloppy drunk and fucked up at least once. It happens. Once is annoying-ish, to some people, but is quickly forgotten. Just don't make it a pattern and it will blow over almost immediately. Some people may crack jokes at you, but that's ok. Just laugh at yourself with them. "
"1) Unless someone asks, don't bring it up. Bring in food (bagels, donuts) and don't say a word about it. 

2) If it comes up, lie and say that you ate something beforehand that ended up disagreeing with you, and that you were miserable the rest of the night. Most people will probably sympathize and accept food poisoning+alcohol = bad mix. 

In a little while there will be a brand new thing that will happen and no one will remember you (except maybe the family you threw up on - there is no good apology for this and I would avoid until you can figure out who they were - and then buy them a gift card). "
"I‚Äôve been there a few times. I can usually hold my alcohol. But on an empty stomach and an open bar, things get dicey.

From experience, I wouldn‚Äôt try to justify yourself and bring it up the excuses you‚Äôve made it here. They‚Äôre probably legitimate, but people aren‚Äôt going to take them into consideration, they‚Äôll believe that whether or not your medical issues were an issue you should have known when to stop. 

You‚Äôre going to want to die of embarrassment for a couple days. People might not mention it. Some might. The people who do are the ones that are grateful it didn‚Äôt happen to them. 

HR might call you in to talk about it. My HR director was super cool and told me she‚Äôs been there too, and the conversation was a formality, and try not to let it happen again."
"Everybody gets one. Don't ever let it happen again, you're good."
"A low carb diet causes you to become dehydrated and low in electrolytes, add alcohol to the mix and you've got an incoherent sloppy drunk.    If you were sitting out in the sun, and not in a box then the sun added into to the mix could easily cause you to become black-out drunk."
"Been there done that. It's usually never as bad as you think. The worst thing about hangovers, now you're getting into the real adult world, is the crushing self-loathing but maybe more than that is the paranoia . If this just happened this weekend then you're probably still hungover a bit and living in paranoia town.

Sometimes I feel like you, when I know for a fact I hadn't done anything bad at all. You will just have to roll with it at work and see if anyone says anything. If people make fun, just laugh along and whatnot. Getting black out does happen to people and if you've only done it once then they will be fine probably. In fact, when it has happened to me, I've noticed people playing it down so as to save my embarrassment a bit. "
"Keto is the culprit. The way it was explained to me is - when your body is used to processing fats for fuel, carbs the day before and day of drinking will not suddenly change that. So your body was still burning fat efficiently as fuel on game day, and then you spiked your blood sugars with beer and carbs. Your liver has to process this influx of sugars by turning it into glycogen, and while it is doing that, you aren't processing alcohol as efficiently (it can only do so much at a time) making your alcohol tolerance much lower. Being dehydrated would exacerbate this. Plus, 25.4 oz are in a bottle of wine, and you had 24 oz plus a beer. So you didn't exactly have only a little bit to drink. I call keto plus dehydration for the win! "
"Don‚Äôt be embarrassed. A few months ago I went to my coworkers concert and got wasted like you. I apparently said to call an ambulance and they did. I didn‚Äôt even have alcohol poisoning, I was just super drunk.  I was SO embarrassed but when I went into work the following Monday I just owned it and apologized. Say you don‚Äôt usually drink wine and beer and that you learned your lesson. It‚Äôll be fine. My coworkers didnt even rly bring it up but when I do we laugh about it now. "
Maybe you should hold your liquor better lightweight
"Alright.

1. Hahahahaha.

2. Wait until your boss gets back, tell your boss what happened, see what they say.

It's no one else's job to deal with this kind of thing, as long as you show that you can take responsibility for your actions and as long as you aren't a total ass, it could go all the way from a slap on the wrist to getting fired, which ... you know. Fair enough.

I did a similar thing and I really didn't want to come in the day after, but I did and I handled it by just arriving and stating to the open office ""Guys, I fucked up bad yesterday. Oh god I can barely remember what happened."" (This was to co-workers in my immediate vicinity, I didn't tour the office)

It was an ok start. Then I scheduled a meeting with my boss, I explained that I was too drunk and high to perform my job but too dumb to call in sick. We discussed why this happened, I proposed a personal plan for how I would improve going forward, he agreed with the plan and we left it there. No biggie, and now everyone knows that I am fun at parties.

I never threw up though, and I don't know how much that will factor into your end result.

Point is, tackle this thing head on. Anything less than head on will look shady and people will talk about behind your back, rather than just going up to you and saying ""Yeah, you did fuck up. What did you do anyway?"" ""Oh, you know. Vodka and some pills I got."" ""Cool, so are you coming to the after-work we're having?"""
Sounds like you had a brownout 
"This might be a bit out of left-field but have you considered that your drink may have been spiked? I agree that you should consider looking for an underlying cause that may have exacerbated your reaction to the alcohol.

As for the ruffled feathers, replacing any clothes etc. that were damaged by your vomiting is a good start, and bring in a token of appreciation like doughnuts or an apology cake. Also, try to find the humour in it and laugh about it to break the tension."
"I think the ""sorry you had to see that"" line kind of implies that it's a common occurrence. Other than that I agree w this advice completely."
"Oh man. At my last job 'donut bribes' started to become a joke. Whenever someone would bring pizza or a donuts in, we'd take bets on how long they would last."
"That seems like a good idea. My work has two main buildings, should I get donuts for both buildings?"
"Luckily, this week is going to be busy for me so I have an excuse not to talk to people in general. I'm hoping your right and with time people just forget."
"The thing is, I don't know who to apologize to! I want to apologize to the family but i didn't see them and don't know which coworker brought them. I would apologize to my boss but he wasn't there/he's on vacation and I thinking apologizing to the CEO or HR would make the situation worse."
Seriously???? I can say with absolute certainly I've never made an ass out of myself like OP.
"I bet you‚Äôre fun at parties. 

In all seriousness, OP didn‚Äôt murder anyone, she didn‚Äôt steal or do anything otherwise morally reprehensible. She doesn‚Äôt deserve to be berated like this. She clearly already understands she overdid it and it‚Äôs also entirely possible that there were other factors that caused her body to react that way. I‚Äôm sure she has learned her lesson (without you telling her she‚Äôs screwed up 50 times) and will not drink at future work events. I get that talking down to others makes you feel better about yourself, but you just come off as as extremely rude and condescending and you might want to consider educating yourself on how to have more empathy and lift others up rather than tear them down. "
"Chill out, you're not some alcoholic savant. You're not the savior of the world by telling people they're stupid. Five drinks really isn't that much. 5 beers is enough to get most people I know in the buzzed-tipsy range, not the blackout drunk range. Having 10 shots or drinks at one point in your life isn't unusual at all, it sounds like OP has a pretty normal relationship with alcohol and you either had a bad relationship alcohol at some point or have a bad relationship in feeling validated by shitting on people on Reddit. I'm all for saying it straight and telling people when they're being dumbasses (there tends to be a lot on this sub), but I think the bigger concern here is that OP has a relatively normal relationship with alcohol and five drinks blacked her out. That clearly is some kind of bad reaction that very well may have been caused by underlying health issues (family history of diabetes, stress/anxiety), and not only is it unfair to quite literally verbally attack OP for that, but really stupid to dismiss that yourself. Most people with pretty standard social lives have encountered heavy drinking at one point or another. It's pretty easy to figure out that most people aren't even close to sloppy after 5 drinks. It's pretty clear that you're either very young or just never spent much time around parties or drinking if you're reacting so violently to someone having 5. Regardless, you don't know what you're talking about and should probably stop."
"I rarely drink and I rarely drink that much. The time i had vodka was in college and it only happened once. I do take responsibility that I drank too much but to say I have a problem with alcohol when I drink maybe once a month and rarely more than two drinks I think is going far.

I'm never drinking at a work event again but my question was about how to face work tomorrow."

"Weird. One beer after wine actually helps with wine headiness, for me. "
"Unless you have some evidence, please don't post myths like this. 'Mixing drinks' isn't a bad thing. Alcohol is alcohol "
"I second the wine + beer doesn‚Äôt mix. I don‚Äôt drink often and when I do it‚Äôs very lightly. I went out to dinner with my husband and had two glasses of wine. Then we went to a local place and I had three glasses of a dark beer I liked. I remember throwing up out of the car and then getting sick at home. I hadn‚Äôt been sick like that since I was 21. 

Mixing white wine and a dark beer was not good. I‚Äôm going to harbor a guess that‚Äôs what happened to you and if you were at a game and it was hot during the day and you didn‚Äôt have a lot of carbs, it was set to happen. 

If your coworkers have never seen you like this before they are probably as horrified as you are. Don‚Äôt stress and don‚Äôt over do it. Don‚Äôt bring apology donuts because that makes it seem like you do this all the time but just got caught. If someone brings it up apologize and comment that a low carb no carb diet before a baseball game was not a good idea. It may take a bit but it won‚Äôt be in the limelight for long. Also don‚Äôt ever put anything in writing like this. "
"I assume you were doing a lot of physical activity during army training? If I'm dehydrated and physically exhausted, alcohol definitely affects me more. "
"If the OP has a small stature and the weather is hot, five alcoholic drinks could easily do a number on her.  "
"Four glasses of wine and one beer but no no new medication, I had been on a lowcarb diet for two weeks but the day before and that day I had plenty of food and carbs so it's weird my tolerance was low. That's why it's weird that I was blackout and needed EMTs to be called because I didn't know where i was and was freaking out and having an anxiety attack."
she said 4 beers and one glass of wine. chill out mr alcohol police.
"So it was like the third inning when we sat on our seats and after that i don't remember much. Me being drunk/blackout was all in the seat so I guess it could have looked like food poisoning but since i was drinking I doubt people will think that. I wasn't partying it up or anything, it was literally all in my seat. Apparently, someone from behind us told my family to take me to the hospital so of course people noticed.

I remember throwing up and my fiance said it was around the 8th or 9th inning. An EMT came at the end of the game cause apparently i physically could not walk without help. The EMT then let me know I was having an anxiety attack so I could go home."
"Yeah, a bad hot dog isn't completely out of the question here."
hahahahah great point
"That's a big gigantic flag saying,
""Hey everybody I fucked up but here's some sugar to help you enjoy your gossip session this morning. Enjoy!""

Your best bet is to lay low and not mention it to anyone. "
"I second lying low and not bringing in doughnuts. No need to ""apologise"" for anything, even if you feel like you need to. It will just bring attention to yourself."
"Yeah, that's a good idea. "
"Thats okay, just apologise to the people that you know were there & anyone else who brings it up. Yes, definitely dont go apologise to boss/CEO/HR, unless they bring it up themselves. You are torturing yourself much more than they will, with the embarrassment, shame & guilt youre feeling. Just carry on as normal & do your job well, you might get a bit of ribbing for it but they know what its like...& the comment about bringing in treats for everyone is a good one too! "
Of course you should apologize to your boss. Write them an email detailing the whole incidence an your explanation. The last thing you want is to for them to get it from other people first.
"Wow, and aren't you just so perfect? The fact is, most people fuck up at some point. Maybe they drink more than they should, or say something they shouldn't have said, date someone bad, something. When that happens, coming at people with that is extremely unhelpful and just sounds like you're bragging and trying to bring people down for no reason. "
"If i thought, for one second, that it was real i would have never posted. "
"Oops sorry, wrong thread!"

"She apparently threw up on a coworkers family. That‚Äôs kind of a problem. Many people will not just go ‚Äúhaha, that happens‚Äù because that doesn‚Äôt happen to most people. There‚Äôs a time to get even buzzed and it‚Äôs not at work events and I think it‚Äôs ok to point that out. 5 drinks when you should actually rather drink like 1 or 2 still seems a lot. Like do you even need to get buzzed around your coworkers? She may have lost some serious respect and if she really threw up on that family, likely neither the family nor the coworkers who are friends with them will laugh it off. They‚Äôll remember and it may impact her even if subconsciously in the future. "
"Really? 5 beers is enough to get me pretty fucking drunk. Not blackout, but 5 drinks in two hours is for a college party or something, not a mid-day work event "

"If you rarely drink, five drinks in two hours while in the sun was a really poor choice...it has nothing to do with carbs. You just drank too much. Own up to it so that you can know and respect your limits for next time"
"I will say you were at a baseball game (in July). Depending on where you live, too much sun, dehydration, 4 glasses within 2 hours and sweating can lead to what you described above. Happened to me too. I can have four beers and feel nothing if I‚Äôm in a cool indoor environment. But put me outside in the heat/sun and those four beers feels like I had 15. 

I wouldn‚Äôt bring it up unless others do. But remember, steer into the skid. Laugh about it. Chalk it up to 4 glasses of wine and to much sun. Then bring donuts/bagels on Friday. "

It was a work event at a baseball game where they rent a rooftop and have connected seat section. I was in the seat section when I blacked out and don't remember much. it actually really scared the shit out of me because of how I was going in and out. And yes, I feel really fucking embarrassed for myself in front of my fiance's dad and work colleagues."
Ok thanks! I know. Just posting from my experience. üëçüèΩ
"Honestly not really. This outing took place before the actual physical part of the mission took place. It was just weird because there were 3 of us who had the same exact thing happen. We all drank the same local beer, spotted cow, from Wisconsin. The beer itself didn‚Äôt even have a really high alcohol content but it fucked us up. We even ate while drinking the beer. "
Were you doing keto? Totally fucks alcohol tolerance. 
"> I had 4 (6 ounces) glasses of wine and a beer. 

Is it ok if I continue to be the comprehension police? 

Depending on how big the pours were, it was a bottle and a half, and specifying ""six ounces"" does not work in favor of truthfulness. A person who doesn't have a problem with alcohol would never even think of describing the issue that way. "
A bad hot dog is out of the question.

"I'm sure we've all embarrassed ourselves, that's part of being human.

But have I ever gotten so drunk I couldn't walk?? Nope Or has the EMT's called on me because I was losing consciousness? Nope
Have I ever puked in public after drinking too much? Nope. Have I ever PUKED ON A FAMILY while watching baseball? Hell Nope.
Have I drunk so much I can't remember the night before? Nope.

I'm not perfect, but I grew up and learned how to be a functioning adult.

People sugar coating this are doing the OP a serious disservice.

This is NOT the equivalent of drinking a little too much and embarrassing yourself at a company party.

This is very serious. It was a work function and it needs to be addressed more seriously than just letting a little too loose on a Friday night.

Also, why am I being downvoted for calling it like it is???"
"No one, including OP, is referring to her as a ‚Äúvictim.‚Äù You can give others advice to improve their lives and their choices without being utterly awful and nasty to them. I don‚Äôt know why I thought someone who clearly leads such a sad and angry existence would be able to understand how to treat others with kindness. I feel truly sorry for you. "
"Wow, you are a horrible person."
"Ok, I never said 5 drinks is an acceptable amount to have at a work function. However, OP didn't have 5 drinks, feel a lil tipsy, and make an embarrassing pass at a co worker or something. It was 5 drinks, blackout, can't walk, vomiting on people, don't remember what happened. I have never seen that happen to someone after 5 drinks. Clearly she had an embarrassing night and needs to tread carefully next time she drinks or avoid it entirely at her next work party, but there is a very good possibility that something else is at play that shouldn't be ignored. In addition, it's really unfair to call OP an alcoholic and accuse her of having an unhealthy relationship with alcohol or being a drunk because she had a few too many free drinks. That's a huge overreaction."
"After talking to fiance, apparently I did not throw up on the family but some thrown up did get on the seat they were sitting on/near. I didn't full vomit on them, not that it makes it better."
"Like the other coworkers weren't buzzed or drunk lmfao. people drink at work events, chill out."

Cool. Why tho. "
"Take a few deep breaths, you're ok. You might want to consider taking a break from Reddit if it's getting you this riled up.

You do some name calling in a few of your comments, including this one right here where you call OP an 'actual drunk'.

Once again, it seems you're just extremely ignorant surrounding what a healthy relationship with alcohol looks like. Someone who drinks on occasion is definitely not a drunk or has an alcohol problem. Most people who are alcoholics don't get hammered off of 5 drinks, have you ever heard of building a tolerance? 

Calm down there."
Lol yeah. Op is all over the place. Sounds like op drinks on the reg and thought that 5 drinks shouldn't hit her so hard but it did. I'm not sure who can drink 10 shots of vodka and not be plowed off their ass but there's a good chance they're drinking too often.
So...hey there WillfullyBlonde. Are you trying to help? Or what? Cause I'm not sure this is productive.
"This is actually good advice. I definitely wouldn‚Äôt blame any possible underlying medical condition because a) you don‚Äôt know if there is one, and b) even if it‚Äôs true, it sounds like you‚Äôre making an excuse for your drinking which will look much worse than accepting responsibility and admitting you drank a bit too much. The most likely explanation isn‚Äôt an underlying medical issue, but that 5 drinks IS enough to get someone pretty drunk, especially considering that 4 of those drinks were wine. Also, the sugar in wine makes it pretty easy to end up with your head in a toilet bowl (or bag, in this case). I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs impossible that there‚Äôs an underlying issue, and it‚Äôs probably a good idea to check it out, but I think it‚Äôs more likely that 5 drinks was a bit too much, especially if you drank them quickly.

I think the best thing you can do is laugh it off and say you don‚Äôt drink much so didn‚Äôt realize you would get that drunk, and maybe make a joke about being a lightweight (e.g. ‚Äúmy diet must be working because I‚Äôm a lightweight - pun intended‚Äù). Unless your coworkers are extremely uptight, they probably don‚Äôt care that much and thought it was funny and a bit unfortunate.

I recommend limiting yourself to one or two drinks in the future though. I don‚Äôt drink often either, and I‚Äôve found that my tolerance fluctuates wildly. I once took 15 shots of tequila within 3 hours and was totally coherent and actually taking care of other drunk people that night. A few months later, I had two margaritas over the course of about two hours and was DRUNK and threw up more times than I‚Äôd like to admit. I ate well, was hydrated, and was well-rested both times and only drink about once a month/every other month. Now that I know my tolerance fluctuates pretty severely, I have a two beer limit for myself at any professional functions, or even casual functions where people I interact with professionally will be attending just in case."
I agree. I thought five drink were okay since I've had more and stronger drinks at happy hours before but for some reason yesterday it was too much and made a complete fool of myself.
"I think getting tipsy at a work event is still in the realm of ""whoops lol"" but man drunk enough to not walk is going to be the talk of the office."
"You're not wrong, but you're being a real condescending jerk about it."
"Lol that‚Äôs right. It‚Äôs no big. It‚Äôd be a big deal if this happens regularly. Yes, me and my army of drunks.....lmao. I apologize that we‚Äôre able to drink on occasion 5 drinks and not get wasted. Comes with the territory I guess. But some people do and it‚Äôs normal. Especially if they don‚Äôt drink often. Just letting her know it‚Äôs totally normal. Just don‚Äôt be so mean to someone who is obviously already feeling bad. What‚Äôs the point? "
"jesus, I'd take an alcoholic over your bitter ass any day. lmao who pissed in your cheerios this morning??"
"This, and so does weight loss in and of itself."
"Yes but the day before and the day of i ate a lot of carbs, so it's not like i had nothing in my stomache."
"woops my bad. yeah it's a decent amount but at the same time i wouldn't go and call her an alcoholic for that or that she has a problem with alcohol. it was a one time thing, not like this is an every weekend issue."
"Seriously, what is up with this advice? ""Of course you should apologise to your boss **in writing**""? Jesus, no. Shut up about it and let it blow over. Be prepared to apologise if it's brought up I guess, but not a moment before."
"Then you let other people make it a big deal for you. You can't de-escalate it unless you own it. ""It was hot and it was outdoor, I got dehyrdated and couldn't handle the alcohol. The medic said I need to take lots of fluid and rest."" As opposed to ""Jen was really wild last night at the party...."""
"> Also, why am I being downvoted for calling it like it is???

You're being downvoted because you're **not** ""calling it like it is"". You're calling it according to the way you see it which is unhelpful and judgemental.  "
">Also, why am I being downvoted for calling it like it is???

You clearly think you're right and just ""telling it like it is"", otherwise you wouldn't be saying it. People are downvoting you because they disagree and think OP shouldn't follow your advice. You're stating what you believe to be objective truth, and they disagree."
"Because you‚Äôre assuming that OP is simply immature and unprofessional and that‚Äôs why she allowed herself to get so drunk at a work event. You‚Äôre also being incredibly judgmental, which isn‚Äôt going to win you any fans."
"I didnt want to imply any of that. But I do think that‚Äôs ok to say it was a bad decision. The thing is, most people will not know that she had 5 drinks (which for some is little, for some is a lot, so it‚Äôs not an objective number of drinks that‚Äôs still ok). I even think the rest of what happened, though definitely not pretty, is that bad, but holy cow, if it makes he round that she drunkenly threw up on Bob‚Äôs wife and kids, that‚Äôs.... not ideal. And any ‚Äúmy blood sugar was low, i was on a diet‚Äù will sound like an excuse. And I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs productive to tell her that should be tolerable. Because for some people that is not tolerable behavior (I think I‚Äôd struggle with it).

But I do agree with you, willfullyblonde is a bit aggressive about it. And I wouldn‚Äôt go so far as to agree with them fully. "
"Actually got a glass of wine in my hand right now.   I can drink responsibly. Have yet to throw up on a co-worker or a member of their family. Or their floor.

It was horrible advice, from a drunk who shouldn't be giving advice on drinking.

I go to happy hours maybe once a month with coworkers. The time i had 10 shots of vodka was once in college. I usually have a higher tolerance but last night I didn't.
"Honestly, people who mildly binge drink say stuff like that a lot. (I used to say the same things) 

  Yes, it's usually more related to social anxiety or the lack of inhibitions after the first 2 drinks go down than it is to what people think of as alcoholism, however it is *still* an unhealthy relationship with alcohol. 

  It's good to set boundaries for different occasions and practice self control. OP should feel bad about their decisions (but not too bad) and then get over it and be mindful in the future."

"Keto drunk isn't to do with empty stomach. I have done keto for long stints myself and I made the mistake once of thinking that carbing up and having plenty to eat that day would make it OK to have a good few drinks. It didn't.

"Eh, you probably needed another day or two of eating normally."
I was on a keto had one glass of wine the day after I stopped the diet and puked my guts up all night! Ten years ago and I still remember it!
Shrug. Literally not my problem. 
"But that‚Äôs assuming that it‚Äôs already a big deal to her colleagues.

The best piece of advice I was ever given was ‚Äòno one thinks about you as much as you do‚Äô. 

OP has spent all weekend stewing over this incident and would potentially really over-apologise if she emailed HR, most of her colleagues will be thinking about completely different things by Sunday night. "
"Ugh, no. Don't turn it into a whole big thing. If you *write an email to your boss detailing what happened* you risk possibly even getting fired. Absolutely terrible advice. Just let it be mild office gossip that will be forgotten in a couple of days."
"OP would be escalating it by making a mountain of out this molehill. Keeping her head down and letting it blow over is the proper way to de-escalate here. Combine with following /u/FoxyOnTheRun_'s advice if anyone approaches her about it before the office moves on to the next thing to gossip about.

As long as this isn't part of a pattern of unprofessional behavior, it's really unlikely to have serious long-term consequences."
"Yeah I think OP screwed up by drinking that much in the first place and not monitoring how she was feeling after 2-3, but I was mainly just addressing the absolutely wacky shit that one person I replied to was saying in his/her parent comment and their other equally aggressive replies. It sounds like OP didn't actually throw up on anyone but some splattered onto a chair one of them had been sitting in, but I do agree that doing anything but taking responsibility for it will come off as excuse making and irresponsible. I still think it would be smart for OP to explore the possibility of having some sort of health issue that contributed to it, not to make excuses, but for her own safety and wellbeing. Also so that she can know that for the future and drink (or not drink) accordingly."
"OP‚Äôs post is still up and visible. *You* were deleted. 


Probably because you‚Äôre so super correct and have such a breadth and depth of knowledge on alcoholism the OP and the mods couldn‚Äôt handle the truth. /s"
What are you talking about? It's a parent level comment where you directly address OP's post...  OP's account is 4 hours old lmao.
"I'm confused.

I do agree with you absolutely! She should get checked out. It‚Äôd be great if I misunderstood and she didn‚Äôt throw up on them. I didn‚Äôt quite understand that part. I think if you take that out the situation is much more manageable and tolerable and people will forget in due time. That‚Äôs the part where I was really thinking her coworkers might actually not look at that too kindly.

"""It's not my entire identity"" says the woman who calls herself wine mom and basically only makes posts in r/drunk.  With odes to how great day drinking is. 

Yeah sure.  You've totally got no problem.  U Fine.  U go girl with your totally moderated life. "
You‚Äôre the one with the wine glass. My original comment stands.

Really?  What sad thing is coming for me? Is it Eeyore? Because I love Eeyore.

"She‚Äôs very young and apparently immature enough to think bragging about getting drunk is cool.  As sad as the post history is, the comment history is even sadder.  Hopefully, she‚Äôll mature and turn things around before it affects her life too negatively.  It‚Äôs unfortunate that there is a child(ren) involved here. "
"Unfortunately, there‚Äôs no way to know.

I have a very good friend whose husband gave her permission to have sex with a woman - she‚Äôs been bicurious and they‚Äôve been together for years and years. It worked out (/is working out) well for everyone: their marriage is stronger than ever. I can also easily see how this could‚Äôve gone the other way and it could‚Äôve ruined their marriage. 

I think my good friend was absolutely sure, somehow, that her husband wouldn‚Äôt regret it. They‚Äôd been talking about it for months, if not years. She started with just kissing another woman, they reassessed, and he said he was ok with her going further. Maybe you can try something like that? Do it in steps?  

And for the record, my friend‚Äôs husband did not ok this because he was interested in a threesome. He didn‚Äôt want a threesome. "
"I don't think this will work without rules. ""It's ok to sleep with a woman"" is very vague. Does he mean multiple times? How much of a relationship can you have with this other woman? Multiple women? Just one? 

I think you should trust your gut. This feels a little too good to be true."
"My boyfriend always told me I could fuck girls and I‚Äôm about 99.9% sure it was just cause he thought the idea was hot, not that I‚Äôd actually do it, and because he‚Äôd though it‚Äôd get him a threesome. 

Why would he let you seriously fuck girls when he won‚Äôt let you fuck guys? I mean the intimacy with sex is about the same, so why one and not the other?

It‚Äôs cause they think it‚Äôs hot and don‚Äôt actually take it seriously. 

There‚Äôs a possibility he‚Äôll get annoyed if you take it seriously, but honestly it‚Äôs his own fucking fault and you should throw his own words back at him if he does put up a hissy fit. 


"
"I have been in this position before and would strongly recommend against exploring your sexuality while in a relationship as young as yours. I can explain further if you want, but I believe you should break up with him and see how you feel about this outside of a relationship."
"I guess I'd think about what it means to you. Do you mean you're bi-curious in the sense that you're questioning your identity, or just that it's a sexual fantasy? I guess either way, it depends on if you also identify as monogamous. If you need to be with a woman to know if you're bi or not (and I'm not sure that you do - many (most?) people know their sexual orientation long before they have a sexual experience), then you have to decide if you need to explore that, and if you feel you can do that ethically while still being in a relationship. And if it's more just that this is a sexual fantasy, is it important enough to your fulfillment that it's worth risking your relationship? I know monogamy isn't for everyone, so I don't say this in a judge-y way, but just pose them as questions for you to ask yourself (obviously don't feel obligated to answer these very intrusive questions to ""us"" here - these are just some things for you to consider when making your decision) to help guide you to the best decision for you: Is ""monogamy"" a value you hold? If so, is exploring this fantasy while in a relationship something that is in line with your personal ethics? If you're not monogamous, or you're consider a non-monogamous arrangement, have you discussed the potential emotional impact with your BF, and talked about what your boundaries are around this - there are a lot of permutations of non-monogamous arrangements, involving boundaries around emotional investment/involvement, sexual behavior, doing things only with certain people, or never more than once with the same person, where you go with your other partners, if they are people you also know IRL or not, who they are introduced to, how you interact with them, etc. Is part of what you're feeling perhaps an uncertainty not just about how your BF will react, but also how you will react? Or perhaps you subconsciously feel something about his willingness to offer you to fulfill this fantasy - maybe feeling that it's an indication that he doesn't care ""enough"" if he's willing to let you have sex with other people? Have you discussed with him how this will work - what information you will share about what happened, how much of it is private, what his involvement (or lack of) will be, and how/if you will process things afterwards? Is this your fantasy that he is giving your ""permission"" to fulfill, or is this a shared fantasy in which he is actively participating in and processing with you? And/or do you think some of your reservation is that you've enjoyed this as a fantasy, but like a lot of fantasies, maybe it is not something you want to do for real, that it's the fantasizing that makes it ""fun?"" Or you're wondering if he ""lets"" you do this, will you feel pressured to ""let"" him fulfill some fantasy of his, and what if his fantasy something you don't agree with? Again, I don't mean any of these questions in a judgemental way. They are just things for you to ask yourself and to consider when guiding you to a decision."
"Hard pause. You are entering into the grey area between monogamy and polyamory. What is by social standards considered cheating in a relationship is now being replaced in context of your relationship. Breaking away from the *socially accepted* aspects of a relationship absolutely requires excellent communication. It could be a conversation over a weekend or a conversation that lasts a year or two.

Your reservations are valid and need to be addressed at length with your BF. Any ulterior or hopeful motive by him or you needs to be on the table. Is he in the hopes of getting an FFM threeway? Would you like that? Is he cool without getting that? Is he just chill enough to be secure that you are seeking another partner? Does he want to seek another partner? Do you want to seek a guy / does he want to seek a girl? Are you uncomfortable with any of that? To what extent of a connection do you want with your new partner? HAVE YOU MADE IT EXPLICITLY CLEAR TO THE NEW PARTNER (this one is important, she could genuinely be looking for a poly relationship and you might accidentally use and emotionally hurt her - this is called unicorn hunting and it is heavily frowned upon)?

Even if it is redundant, a lot of topics need to be talked about. THE biggest issue in poly is failure of communication. Your reservation indicate that you haven't discussed things enough or that you need more than casual support. Compersion is being happy for another's happiness. *You* clearly need his compersion in addition to the already present compassion."
"\> Today I found an awesome girl on Tinder who wanted to come over to hook up, but I couldn't bring myself to go through with it because I worried it might hurt my boyfriend. I asked him again and he told me he was still fine with it, but I worry this moment of fun--as deeply as I want it--could bite me in the ass later on. What do you think?

Follow your instincts. :D"
[removed]
"How deep was the conversation with your boyfriend? Was it like you saying
oh i‚Äôd like to fuck a girl sometime and him saying oh yea go for it. Or was it a real conversation where he assured you multiple times that he was ok with you exploring your bi-sexuality.

I would sit down with bf and tell him you found a girl you want to have sex with, show him the tinder profile and everything. Ask him is he sure that you can still go through with it. As now he has a real life person to picture with you instead of random imagined girl and knows you are serious. If he‚Äôs still ok with it then I say go for it."
"Maybe. He might be so bothered that you two break up. He might be a little bothered, but at a solvable level. He might be totally neutral. He might find it hot. 

The easiest way to reduce your level of risk, I think, is to do less initially ‚Äì¬†e.g. try making out with a girl, and see how your boyfriend feels. If he's ok with that, he'll probably be okay with more ‚Äì otherwise, you may want to pull back.

(Also, make sure the girl you're potentially hooking up with knows it's a one-time thing. Don't lead her on.)"
"This is a great idea, to take it in steps and reassess. Thank you!"
"My fiance had a threesome in the past and honestly he said that the last thing he'd do while living/married to me was a threesome. Why? Because he actually believes that could jeopardize our relationship plus he said threesomes are not that fun. 

You're so right about everything, some men will say is ok but very few actually believe it. "
There is almost no risk of serious STD transmission during lesbian sex.  There is no risk of pregnancy.  There are lots of reasons they would be ok with it.
Thanks so much for sharing... I would love to hear more about your experience. I don't want to break up with him--I care about him more than I care about exploring my sexuality right now (though I suppose that could change)
Great questions to think about.. Thanks for your thoughtful answer!
This one is excellent advice OP and offers more questions to think about as 2 other people with feelings and expectations besides you are involved in this. Thus all three of you need to be 100% fully aware and consenting of the expectations before during and after.
I told him I would love to have a threesome but I'm more into the idea than he is
"Yeah, he probably thinks it's hot and he might get lucky one day."
"Feel free to message me. My friend has shared with me tons of details not included in this comment, or I‚Äôm happy to ask her something for you. 

She‚Äôs happier than she‚Äôs ever been. "
"Ehhhh I have never heard a guy list those reasons as reasons they're okay with sex with another woman. Would he be okay with a guy who tested clean and had a vasectomy? Probably not, I'd wager. "
Not true swapping body fluids has risks. 
"I dated a woman I knew was bisexual pretty early on in our relationship for about 5 years. We actually started dating  around your age too. I knew she had these predilections and I asked her about it early in our relationship, but she didn't consider it that big of a deal as she loved me more than needing to have sex with women.

It wasn't until the later years in our relationship this started to become more of an issue. She would get drunk and make out with or feel up a girl once or twice a year, but still deny it was a **need** to explore her sexuality. However, this changed after we went to grad school and she got an IUD (in her words). She suddenly started to feel differently and ""really gay.""

However,  while I was still willing to let her explore her sexuality, she began to feel ""constrained"" by the relationship and found it hard to pick up girls and have sex with other people while her boyfriend texted her everyday saying ""I love you"" and whatnot. We eventually broke up so she could ""be free"" and it was much more devastating than it would have been if she had just broke up with me years ago and figured that shit out herself. It also made me insecure and doubt many things about our relationship because I couldn't tell where the truth ended and the lies started.

We had slept together for 5 years so of course she liked guys to a certain extent, but she obviously liked girls. Did she leave because she no longer wanted to continue down our path and commit to me in whole (marriage) so she could just fuck whoever walked by? Or was she honestly confused, and though she still loved me, she needed to find herself or she would never be truly happy? Or maybe both? Or maybe something in the middle?

I will never have those answers and have to accept the facts that I either misjudged the values of someone I lived, slept, and loved for years, or that sometimes even if two people deeply love each other, there are things in life that can get in the way of them being together forever. I accept both but it still definitely messes with my head and I can never approach another relationship as innocently, full of love, and wholeheartedly as I did that one. But, that's part of growing up.

In short, you don't know how you will feel after sleeping with women as you haven't slept with any women. Please do not use your current boyfriend as a training ground as you attempt to work through your sexuality issues. Making a relationship work is already hard enough without those concerns, so let him find someone that wants to go all in with him without needing to explore what's out there."
"You know him better than any of us ... either he wants your best an respects you dearly or he is desperate . or .. I dunno. 

If you go thru with it .. just make sure that you give him a lot of affection before and after, so he doesn't feel discarded or lost. And even then .. who knows?"
"I keep advocating for a threesome but he keeps making excuses to not do it, so I don't think that's it in this case"
"It's more that another man is a threat than anything else. A girl can fool around with another girl but there's centuries of social and biological pressure keeping it from going any further: leaving the boyfriend for a girl is *very* unlikely. If she goes the other way and has sex with a guy, the worry is he might be better and her choice is a lot easier."
"Hmm, then maybe he is smart enough to know that could go wrong if he gave her too much attention?

What about a guy? If he says no, then he likely just thinks it's hot for you to be with a woman or doesn't see them as ""competition""."
If your girlfriend is bi a girl is also a threat...
"Yes you got it exactly. He told me once that having a threesome seemed ""risky"" to our relationship and that he doesn't see me having sex with women as competition to our relationship, though sleeping with men would be"
"Yes, but ""bicurious enough to fool around with a girl"" and ""bicurious enough to be seen as a lesbian by your family and friends (with all the implications in our often-backwards society)"" are two very different levels of bicurious."
"of course, its just from a guy's perspective they dont see it that way 

other man  = threat 

other woman = kinky, possible threesome 

"
Depends. A lot of bi people have a strong preference for one or the other. Flirting and sex is fine but relationships are a bridge too far. 
It‚Äôs possible to be bi*sexual* and hetero*romantic*.
"If she didn‚Äôt take the time to cultivate a quality relationship with you in your younger years, she  can‚Äôt really expect you to be so willing to try now. Have your trip with your partner.  Deal with your mom later."
"You're being totally reasonable. You guys don't get along. Taking a trip won't change that, and will just fill that portion of your vacation with negative memories.

If you'd like, suggest that you guys plan a separate trip. But honestly it sounds like enforcing a boundary where she doesn't get to guilt trip you for not inviting her would be better than any other option you could come up with. She sounds like a world class manipulator. When she brings it up say ""You already know my thoughts on this, this trip is strictly for wife and I."" And then if she doesn't drop it end the visit, or the phone call or whatever."
"Oh Gawd. No. Just No... please don't do this to your wife...
If i were in your wife's shoes i'd be posting in r/justNOmil ..."
All the guilt she can manufacture will not come close to the regret you'll feel if you let her join you.  Just keep telling her that this trip is not the occasion to work on her new-found interest in relationship building.    
"Don't feel bad, stick to your guns and go on a trip with your wife (and only your wife). "
How many foreign vacations did your mom and dad spend with her mom or MIL?  I'm guessing zero.  Use that fact to help her process how inappropriate this request is.
"""I dont really want her to come along because we would prefer to enjoy our trip together with just my wife and I.""

That was all you needed to say really. Perfectly valid.

It's your vacation, nobody has the right to nudge their way in without an express invitation, not even parents. And especially not someone you don't get along with and tend to argue with.  Sounds like a vacation from hell with you and your wife tiptoeing around trying to avoid arguments or tension, instead of relaxing and enjoying each other's company. The age difference is too disparate so her interests won't necessarily be yours and I don't believe anyone has to compromise on their vacation to please someone else if they don't want to. Not even for a few days, which I don't believe will be the case.  ""A few days"" has a huge chance of turning into much longer since it means flying such a long distance.  It would be better to spend a few days on some mini-vacation closer to her at another time.

I love travel and my trips are precious and special. They cost a lot of money and the time off is sometimes difficult to arrange. Vacations with my husband are our time to be together and create lifelong memories that we will cherish forever. They've strengthened our relationship and allowed us to learn more about each other and connect closer.  Vacations with other people are totally different experiences. Stand your ground. Don't give into the pathetic guilt trips and manipulation bs. Oh, and don't give her details as to your itinerary, just in case she decides to crash your vacation.  ""Surprise!!!"""
"One, she had your whole life to build a relationship, and frankly, as the parent it's her job to do so. This is not your mess to fix.

Two, if she wants to create a relationship-building vacation or whatever, she can plan it with you at a later time. She doesn't get to take over a planned vacation between a husband and wife. Ew. Just no.

Three, if you don't get along with her, I don't advise you spend prolonged time with her at all. You can have whatever relationship with your mother that *you choose* and that is best for your health and well-being. That involves no contact, low contact, two dinners a year, etc. "
"This reminds me of someone saying their in-laws invited people to their wedding without asking them because they ‚Äúhadn‚Äôt seen them in a while‚Äù and ‚Äúall the family will be there‚Äù. Essentially using someone else‚Äôs event as their own personal get-together/reunion. 

Definitely related it to this situation as your mother saw your planned trip as a personal opportunity and projecting the guilt on you when you felt uncomfortable."
"The unreasonable person here is your mum, who is

* Trying to crash a holiday you and your wife organised for *yourselves*. 

* Emotionally manipulating you for saying no.

Honestly, I don't think your mum wants to go on this trip to see *you*. I think she wants to take advantage of the overseas trip you've organised and get her own holiday out of it. She might even start insisting you cover her expenses. 

If she wants to see you, she can make the effort to see you another time. Or she can organise a mother-son holiday with you. Just say no. No to her joining you on the holiday, no to ""it's just a few days"", no to ""you'll regret this when I'm dead and gone!""

Go have a great holiday with your wife. Consider blocking your mum's number whilst you're gone."
"People shouldn‚Äôt try to invite themselves on other people‚Äôs vacations.  It sounds like your mother tried to invite herself, you said no, and now her feelings are hurt.  She probably won‚Äôt try that again, which will make it a little easier to get along with her in the future.  Sometimes expressing yourself clearly and hurting somebody‚Äôs feelings is the least bad outcome to a situation.  

You mentioned that you visit your mother a few times a year, so you probably have some sort of plan of when you‚Äôd like to see her next.  When she starts talking about the vacation, I think you should just redirect to the next time you do plan to see her, and express that you look forward to having a nice time with her then.  

If you ignore guilt trips and they don‚Äôt achieve your mother‚Äôs goals, she might throw less of them around.  You can also call her on it when she uses them ‚ÄúMom, that was a manipulative thing to say.  I‚Äôm going to end this call, and we can talk another time‚Äù or ‚ÄúMom, I know you‚Äôre upset, but when you say things like that, it just drives me away.‚Äù"
"You have very valid concerns. And the fact that you can't be sure that she would stick to her word for only being a few days of the trip solidifies you have a reason to be concerned.

If she was respectful of your relationship with her, she would understand and not pull guilt trip bs. She should be concerned of your relationship when there isn't something in it for her too.

Tell her it's an important vacation that has already been planned for you and your wife. Give her an opportunity to plan a  separate vacation down the line for a short duration that you guys can try at another time. See if she respects your interest in the planning. 

If I was your wife, btw, I would be crushed if you  invited your mom.  Even if there was a good relationship.
"
"You're being perfectly reasonable. As the biological relative in this in-law relationship, it's your job to set clear boundaries with your mother. Do it now rather than later, because it will only escalate."
"You are not at all unreasonable.  In all likelihood, your Mom will want to stay in your accommodations or want you to change your plans to cater to her or something.  This is NOT her vacation.  It's yours and your wife's vacation.  You can visit with Mom another time.

My advice:  Mom can't horn in if she doesn't know the details of your plans.  Don't tell her your itinerary and don't give her the details of your travel plans."
"I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre being completely unreasonable, but you and your wife will be on a trip for a full month. If I were you, I‚Äôd offer to spend a few days with your mom.

Three days out of thirty isn‚Äôt that many, and it‚Äôd probably make her really happy. "
We haven't heard how his wife feels about it. She may not be jazzed about her MIL coming along for what will probably turn into 1/4 of their trip- esp since MIL and OP will probably  fight
"Plus this is an **overseas** trip - unless OP's mom happens to be there for something else(which OP says she's not), it's a huge committment for her to join for just a few days...which is why it'd probably turn into a bigger chunk of the trip, and why OP should avoid that being an option in the first place.

Tacking plans onto someone else's already-concrete plans is stressful even when everyone involved likes each other. It'd be a disaster here."
Yeah she is not super into the idea to say the least...
"I would feel the same way. I love my mother in law but I don't want to vacation with her unless that was the original plan. I want to visit her more often but that doesn't mean she should come on couple trips with us.

So if I were you I'd just tell your mom you love her and you'd like to plan a trip to see her. But this trip is for you and your beautiful wife.

I'd be mortified if I realized I was trying to add myself to a couples private getaway, wouldnt you? That should tell you that what your mom is doing isnt 'normal'."
"Your post makes it sound like he asked you to leave him alone, you did not, and *then* he said mean things. 

What he said was unacceptable, but you should also respect him enough to leave him alone when asked to instead of pushing him to kiss and make up when he‚Äôs not ready to. 

Please resolve these issues before getting married. "
"So when he asks for space in a heated moment, you won't give it to him? Am I reading that right?

Because this account:

>I kept pressing because I wanted to kiss and make up. 

>I hate leaving fights in the air, I need to feel there was ""closure"",

Doesn't seem to jive with this claim:

>I long for a relationship where we'd fight but then say something like ""I need some time alone away from you

So I'm confused. "
"Sure, it's not good that he says he doesn't respect you, but you really gloss over the fact that he wanted to be left alone and you refused to respect his request! You wanted to kiss and make up - great, fine, **he didn't right then**, and you viewed what you wanted as more important than what he wanted. And guess what? That has consequences.

I'm not sure if you're being a pushover or the one trying to steamroller him into saying things are OK just so he'll have some peace and quiet. Honestly from what you've written it sounds at worst like you pushed and pushed and pushed until he snapped. And no what he said wasn't great, but it may accurately represent what he was feeling if he'd been harangued by you for however long it was, instead of you just giving him the space he needed to cool off. What was the fight even about? You conveniently left that info out.

Edit: I can't help but think the reverse would be an interesting perspective: ""when my fianc√©e and I argue, she won't leave me alone until the issue is 'resolved' even if I'm begging her for a bit of time and space to get my head together and calm down. She won't let the issue drop, and sometimes I get so stressed I say things I don't mean like 'I don't love you right now' because I can't get my head straight. How do I get her to respect my needs?"""
"Regarding your edit, his wishes are more important to him because his wishes involve ONLY him - wanting to be left alone. He's not wanting you to interact in a certain way with him. Conversely, your wishes after a fight DON'T involve just you. Your wishes involve certain expectations of his behavior and how he interacts with you. The difference is about autonomy and boundaries. I think one person wishing to simply be left alone is entirely different than the other person wishing for a certain type of interaction, because the one who wants to be left alone is not imposing on the other person's boundaries. I don't know if I'm explaining it right, but I'm trying to explain a difference: compromising when problem-solving or disagreeing on something is a ""fair"" thing to expect, but asking someone to compromise their personal boundaries (like his stated need for space/to be left alone) can feel like disregard for their boundaries, or trampling their boundaries, or even a violation. As an example, I'll presume your relationship is monogamous, and let's say he wants to go to a swingers party and swap partners, but you say no, that you want a monogamous relationship. If the swinging is a ""need"" for him, then you're incompatible. He doesn't get to say that the ""fair"" compromise between monogamy and swinging is that you have a threesome because three is halfway between two (the two of you that you want) and four (the foursome/swapping that he wants). It's a crass example, but you see what I mean? He stated a boundary about being left alone, and jut because it's incompatible with what you want doesn't make it unfair for him to uphold it. 

 The ""fair"" way to handle it is for you, in a calm moment, to discuss your needs and boundaries regarding how to handle conflicts in the future, and see if you can work together to reach a mutually agreeable compromise of some sort (maybe instead of compromising about you getting some reassurance before leaving him alone, the compromise is about how much time he needs alone, or maybe he texts you a quick ""just need time,"" or texting to check in after a certain amount of time just to let you know he's still alive, even if he's not ready to talk yet, or something?). Make sure you encourage him to be honest about his needs, too, and actually listen to what he says. And if you can't find a compromise that is mutually agreeable, then it doesn't mean one of you is right and one of you is wrong, or that someone is being unfair. It means that your needs are incompatible.

And think hard about the incompatible part. Because love isn't enough for a healthy relationship. Some things just can't be compromised on enough to make you compatible, if you're too far apart to begin with.  Better to realize that now than to struggle for years to make a sinking ship float before finally accepting it was never seaworthy.

Edit: I thought of a better example to explain the difference between what he wants and what you want, and by you calling for a compromise, it's still a boundary violation to him: Let's say you want a 3 kids, and he wants none. It's not a fair compromise to have just one or two kids, because "
"If someone tells you to leave them alone, listen to them.

I'd be angry too if I asked my SO to leave and they sat there trying to be all nice.

I don't want you here, I want to cool off my own way. Get lost. 

It's not right that he said mean things, but evidently that's the only way he can get through to you. "
"Your version of compromise is not fair. He's asking for space to calm down and process the fight, and you're asking him to kiss you and pretend everything is okay. It's not okay at the moment. You just fought. No pretend assurance will fix that. Honestly, I find it kind of creepy that you want him to put on a fake smile and give you a kiss when he doesn't want to just to make you feel better. That's something an abuser does after abusing their partner. That's not to says you're a abusive or an abuser per se. Sometimes otherwise good, kind, non-abusive people have a behavior that's abusive; the difference is being willing to introspect and change.

Let him breathe and then talk things through. You need to manage your own emotions *like he's trying to do* rather than wanting him to manage them for you. A fake make up kiss doesn't fix the issues. Calming down, thinking things through, and then talking about them when you're both calm and ready does.

That said, his reaction was not okay. If this isn't typical for him, then let it pass this once. People are really quick to castrate guys for losing their temper, but humans are fallible and people say things they don't mean sometimes, especially when they're being pushed and prodded. Apologize for not respecting his space, and hopefully he'll apologize for what he said. If he doesn't then it's time to wonder if he means those things, and where to go from there."
"Some people don't like being pestered constantly when they are upset. It doesn't excuse saying hurtful things at all, but you guys should figure out communication before you get married; it doesn't get easier after marriage."
"I think there are things that you both need to work on when it comes to arguments. 

In terms of you, it‚Äôs important to realise that some people can‚Äôt simply be ready to kiss and make up straight away and need more time to calm down and get their thoughts and emotions in order. Pushing him to be okay when he isn‚Äôt emotionally ready to be will make him more frustrated and make it harder for him to calm down and return to normal.

However, your fianc√© needs to realise that his words are hurtful and don‚Äôt make the situation any better. It‚Äôs likely he‚Äôs taking his frustrations at the situation out on you which isn‚Äôt right and he needs to remember that his words aren‚Äôt empty and that they have consequences; but not leaving him alone when he asks for it and pushing him to be okay won‚Äôt help these frustrations. 

You might want to write him a letter explaining your thoughts on the situation and how you can both work together to improve it. Don‚Äôt write it in a way which blames him or infer your own explanations for his actions; simply set out the facts and suggest some solutions. Invite him to write you a response. 

Ultimately, you are two different people who have different ways of dealing with your emotions. It may be best for you both to take a little time away from each other in different rooms to cool off then resolve the situation once you‚Äôre both calm. If there aren‚Äôt any improvements or one of/both of you are struggling to make those compromises, rethinking marriage may be something you have to do."
"What he‚Äôs saying is not okay. But also (because it always takes two to tango) it sounds like you are backing him into a corner and then he lashes out. 

In my relationship I am the one that gets mad when BF wants to ‚Äòkiss and makeup‚Äô while I am still heated after an argument. People don‚Äôt have on/off switches and it always feels dismissive when he thinks a kiss fixes everything. He also feels the same way when I try to cuddle him after he‚Äôs upset. 

What works best for us is a quick ‚ÄúI love you, I‚Äôm going to go cool down for a bit.‚Äù Then we go our separate ways for an hour or so. THEN we do the whole smooches-I-love-you-I‚Äôm-sorry thing. Directly after, it tends that one or both of us just aren‚Äôt feeling it and that‚Äôs okay."
When he asks you to leave him alone... then leave him alone!!  It seems to me like your pushing and pushing is what led him to say those things to get you to back the fuck off.  You need to learn to let him have his space when he asks for it or this marriage will not work.
"He asked you to leave him alone and you refused because in that moment your feeling of wanting to kiss and make up or wanting to feel ""closure"" was more important to you. If he is asking for space, you need to respect that. What he said is hurtful, but he expressed his wishes with you in that moment and you blatantly disrespected those wishes. 

And in regards to your edit, your compromise is not a compromise if he can only have his alone time AFTER he gives in to your need for more communication. I think a better compromise is after he expresses he needs space, give him that space. You two could even discuss a timeline (during a time when you are not arguing) such as ""an hour cool-off"" and after that he needs to come to you and squash it. Or after that time he would need to communicate if he needs a little more time with the reassurance that everything is OK, he's just annoyed. "
">How do I deal with it feeling unfair if I just entirely respect his wish to be left alone? I have trouble distinguishing between being a pushover and standing up for myself.

You need to change the way you view this situation.  When you are fighting with someone and they ask for some space to be left alone they are actually being very respectful of you.  They are trying not to let the argument escalate to the the point where hurtful things are said.  You need to be able to return that respect by honoring the request.  Give him time to cool down and then you can re-open the discussion when you are both in a better head space."
"I‚Äôm also a person that likes to deal with issues and then move on. I hate hitting pause on things and existing in the weird purgatory between the beginning and end of the argument. That being said, if you want to be with him and he‚Äôs someone that needs time to cool down during an argument, you have to learn to do that or every argument will be much, much worse than it should be. 

Make it clear that he cannot speak to you that way under any circumstances (but don‚Äôt get stuck on this point - what he said was hurtful and unacceptable but the bigger issue here is communication), but that you were also in the wrong for pushing him to continue an argument when he needed a break. Then tell him you‚Äôre willing to compromise so future arguments don‚Äôt get as heated. You can set ground rules, like he can ask for a break during an argument, but you need to know when he‚Äôll be ready to talk again. So, saying ‚ÄúCan we talk about this later?‚Äù is not okay but saying ‚Äúcan we talk about this in an hour after I‚Äôve calmed down?‚Äù is okay. Maybe you could also have a rule to finish the argument the same day that you started it so that it doesn‚Äôt run into the next day too. Figure out what works for both of you, and remind him that this is difficult for you and not your preferred method of handling conflict so he‚Äôll have to be patient with you while you get better at it. 

Even though I hate handling conflict like this, there are some real benefits. It keeps things from getting too extreme like they did in your post. It also gives you both time to realize that the little arguments are stupid so by the time you‚Äôre ready to pick the argument back up, you might both decide it‚Äôs not worth continuing and you can make up instead. 

For me, the most important things are having a set time to resume the argument so I don‚Äôt feel like the other person is just brushing it off and dismissing my feelings about the situation, and finding something to distract myself during the interim so I‚Äôm not constantly thinking about the argument and getting angrier. 
"
"My husband is like this about disagreements too. I'm also just like you in that I would rather dive in and sort it out. 

As hard as it is, try to give him space when this happens. Go write about your frustrations, watch funny videos, bake a cake. Whatever calms you down and allows you to not bug him when he is trying to sort through his emotions. 

Trying to force him to talk when he clearly needs space will only make things worse. Let him cool off and then get back to finding a solution. 

I'm not saying you are in the wrong. You two just have different ways of handling conflict. Address this when the situation is less heated but still remember you can't make him change his approach 100% in the same way you can't really change yours completely. Find that middle ground that allows him some space but allows you to find closure. "
"I used to feel very similar to you. What helped me to get past feeling hurt if my partner needed space was to use a ""we'll return to this"" type technique. 


I had a history of my partner walking out of conversations with no conclusion, so it hurt when he wanted space. I always felt abandoned. So, instead, when he needed space, we would set an amount of time (ie: 1 hour) or a time (ie: at 6:00 pm) when we would come back together and revisit the conversation. It gives the side that needs space space, and the side that needs closure a confirmation that the talk will be revisited and closure will happen.


That said, it requires a partner who is willing to make sure they return to the conversation at that time (in this case, your BF) and a partner who is ok dealing with the initial discomfort (in this case, you) of having to walk away for a short amount of time. I needed to practice dealing with that discomfort (through practice) before I could start to really understand why my partner may need time to cool off. My anxiety of my partner wanting space would just take over and things would go worse. By forcing myself to go through that waiting period, I was able to practice dealing with that anxiety outside of a disagreement. 


Its hard, don't get me wrong, when your perception of a person needing space is so inherently negative. If you want to try the above technique, try having a conversation about it when things are good. Maybe you can even write little cards that say ""I love you, but I need (10, 30, 60) minutes to cool off, then we'll revisit this conversation."" that he could hand you? Then you could get your words of appreciation along side his request for space?"
"Do you two actually make an attempt at reconciling the issues? Or is he just waiting for it to blow over, never addressing the problem, never apologizing for saying those intentionally very hurtful things?
"
"Dude not many people wanna cuddle after a fight, especially not when they just got hounded. What he said wasn't nice, but you ignored his boundaries. Outed important to give people space to figure things out, a relationship isn't just about being happy and feel good ask the time."
"If the two of you haven't figured out how to communicate more effectively than this, you have no business getting married."
"During arguments it's normal for people to say nasty things, but when they are specifically aimed at you - personal attacks, saying things they know will hurt you - that's a different matter. Don't marry a man who dons't respect you. Period. "
I‚Äôd get out now. Especially if you plan on having kids. Would you be ok with someone treating your children that way??? Your feelings are valid (as are his) but hurtful words don‚Äôt get forgotten when you‚Äôre not angry anymore. And he should respect you always. 
That's what I read too. 
"I need to work on my insecurity, because while he did say he wanted time away, the second part (""we're okay"") is important for me to hear at the same time. "
"I appreciate the hard truth. It's true, I didn't respect his request. That's why I'm feeling so confused, on the one hand I feel like he shouldn't say those things, period, but on the other I'm the one who didn't leave it alone. I agree with I guess viewing what I want more important! I mean I don't want to act that way, but whenever I try to stop myself I think to myself ""wait, I need to defend ME, why are his wishes more important than mine"" so then I double down. I guess in my mind I view the aftermath of a fight like this: what he wants is no more communication, what I want is a lengthy ""feel-good"" conversation, so a compromise is me leaving him alone AFTER we do a quick ""it's gonna be okay"" peck. And I don't feel it's fair if we don't get to that compromise. 

The fight was honestly really minor. Something about being hot at a family function and then people commenting he seemed off. "
"That really puts it in perspective... I see what you mean, I guess I was wrong thinking he was unfair. I just figured since we're ""one"", he should want to make me feel a bit better too, even if it disregards his boundaries about being left alone. Sounds really selfish now. "
"I‚Äôm the same way in my marriage.  When my husband and I have disagreements (mostly fully charged emotional ones) I need to take a step back and just be away from him and left alone.  I just need a moment to process what I‚Äôm feeling and calm my racing brain so I can have a rational adult conversation.  It did take my husband a small amount of time to adjust because he said he didn‚Äôt like it but when I explained my reasonings for space and that calmer heads prevail for me in the end, he starting giving me the space.  I am lucky in that he‚Äôs about the most understanding, supportive and loving man I‚Äôve ever known and we do have really great communication.  And in return having good communication skills helps you feel secure in your relationship so when you do have an argument you both know it‚Äôs not going to break you."
">  is important for me to hear at the same time. 

yea, there's your problem. its about what YOU want, and not about whats good for him or the both of you. "
"When you've fought and he's upset, you're not ""okay"" and it's really shitty to force him to validate you. I'm the exact same way as him. With my husband, the most I'm willing to say when I'm upset with him is ""we'll *be* okay but we aren't right now"" and then I need space and time. "
You‚Äôre not entitled to hearing that. Sorry Op. 
"Thing is, you don't get to decide by yourself what a compromise is - you work *together* and find a solution *together*. It's not you vs. him, it's you both vs the problem. You should both be looking out for each other's feelings - you need to defend yourself, but also put yourself in his shoes, and consider how he's feeling about the situation. And of course he should be doing the same - if he's not, that's another, arguably bigger problem.

Best thing may be to discuss the best approach when you're both calm and happy - you say what you need, he does likewise, and you agree on a middle ground. Because fighting about how you fight is really unhealthy, and means you never really resolve the core issue because you're too busy bickering around the edges! "
"The reason some people want time to cool off though is so they can collect their thoughts and process their feelings and then discuss it when they‚Äôre not so heated.

You‚Äôre basically saying after every fight, regardless of his feelings he needs to tell you it‚Äôs ok and make up. That‚Äôs really not fair to him. A compromise would be you give him time to cool off and then you both discuss the fight a little later and make up then."
"If this were a healthy relationship, you would KNOW that things were ok. You wouldn't need to beg him to reassure you of that fact."
"You asked why his ""wishes"" were more important than yours, why are your wishes more important than his needs? He may not just want to go away for a few minutes, he may NEED to.

Personally, when I am angry or upset I shut down because I know my first stop is bitch-town; if someone keeps hounding me after I have said I need to remove myself well, all-fucking-aboard, we're going on a trip that won't be fun for anyone. However, if I'm allowed a few minutes to collect myself then things can proceed in a loving way."
"I think I see the problem. As an adult, after a fight, you make *yourself* feel better. He's trying to get his head on straight and you're asking him to kiss your booboo instead of using your own self-soothing techniques. I'm not saying you'll have nothing to discuss or work out after an argument, but getting back to a place of calm where that can happen is your own responsibility. Likewise, so is giving him time to put himself back into a rational place."
"> I mean I don't want to act that way, but whenever I try to stop myself I think to myself ""wait, I need to defend ME, why are his wishes more important than mine"" so then I double down.

> I just figured since we're ""one"", he should want to make me feel a bit better too, even if it disregards his boundaries about being left alone. Sounds really selfish now. 

See the disconnect?"
"Have you ever seen the show ‚ÄúEveryone Loves Raymond‚Äù.  That is your life. 

He is a mamas boy.  If you marry him she‚Äôll still be at your house doing everything.  OR he will expect you to fill her shoes - you‚Äôll be doing everything for him.  Do you want to cut up his steak for him and iron his undies?

Also doesn‚Äôt he have any shame/respect -why is he letting his mother do all this?  "
RUN. There is no way this transitions into a relationship where Mom respects any kind of boundaries if he is 30 years old and she is still babysitting him. I recommend you stop by /r/JUSTNOMIL if you want a view into your future.
Agreed. So what's the question?
"Your boyfriend is a ""mamas boy"", someone already noted that - How long are you in a relationship? Did you NOT see any signs of this before? That will turn ugly - as someone noted also - he will expect you to fill her shoes, or take over all together.. There are lots of guys how work 50+ hours a week and still take care of a household - she's even moving his lawn?!?! Geez!!  run..  cheers"
I think you already know what we will say. You don't need people to tell you to leave.
"If you stay with him, expect to also be responsible for taking care of the entire household and catering to him like a child. "
I understand that you find it disturbing. But did you ever talked about it with your boyfriend? And what was his response?
"> and if so did it get better?

Things are just fine for him! I doubt he sees it as a problem that needs fixing. If you don't want to end up taking her place someday you need to be very clear with him about how you expect to divide up responsibilities. And I'd also suggest telling him that you'd want to see him doing these chores himself before you think about moving in with him. That might just be the kick in the pants that he needs."
"He's a mamma's boy and that means you are the **second** woman in his life and will always be behind his mommy.    You can't fix a Mamma's boy, once he gets to be 30.  Time for a new boyfriend, he already has a woman in his life."
"Red flag. If you stay with him, all those duties will fall on you. Grown men don't change."
"Um, theoretically you are right but literally 90&#37; of my co-workers who live at home brings lunch cooked by parents. 

Sure this is his house..but perhaps it is a family house? 

I am not saying that's an excuse to be lazy but it is fairly natural in MANY cultures that parents do this stuff for kids even AFTER they are adults. 

It could be that he's a take-out guy but his Mom just told me no......I'll cook since I'm retired. (I have a few friends in this situation. They do their share of work around the house...I don't think they are lazy.)

\> buys all his clothes.

Are you sure you are not exaggerating here?"
Plastic cover on the sofa included 
"OP is asking if someone has been through a similar situation and if it got better. 

She‚Äôs essentially asking if a man-child ever stops being a man-child. The answer is ‚Äòno‚Äô. Except in extremely rare situations where the man-child HIMSELF wants change. 

But in this case, why would he change anything? OP‚Äôs bf was raised to think that it‚Äôs normal for his mother to be his personal maid. What motivation does he have to change? Self-pride? But...he‚Äôs got a Fortnite match waiting for him!!"
"And she's routinely cooking for him even though one of them has to drive over to get the food to him! He, a *thirty year old,* couldn't even pick out towels and sheets by himself! That's insane!

One or two of the smaller things would be a yellow flag to discuss, but possibly not a huge deal. All of them together leads me to assume he has zero basic household skills(other than laundry, which is honestly pretty simple anyway), which will rapidly become obvious if you make the mistake of moving in with him."
">hat will turn ugly - as someone noted also - he will expect you to fill her shoes, or take over all together.. There are lots of guys how work 50+ hou

3 years, I should of saw it coming cause hes been only working for 2 years before that he didnt work after high school and he said it was cause he help out with family garden and before he bought the house he lived with his mom and she did all shopping and i told him i live at home and buy all my own stuff and he told me he was raised different"
Exactly. And expect his mother resent you for not doing as well or as enthusiastically as her.
That she already out shopping and picks him up some items cause he doesnt like going shopping and his mother knows that and think he wouldnt go
Are you honestly calling her a liar?
"The funny thing is, his mother would probably resent OP anyways if she did everything as well as her. *''Oh, so now your wife is replacing me!''* 

Shudder. "
Okay. But what did he say about your arguments? 
Excuses he isn‚Äôt a man he is a boy omg RUN 
"He wants to do it again someday? What sort of apology for cheating is that? There‚Äôs no woman on earth who could feel secure  with that bit of  information hanging over her relationship. Generally, when a person tells you who they are, believe them. 

Ps. Maybe ask your mil what she meant, if you get along with her. "
"OP there is literally no way she doesn't know about the affair with the way she is acting now. So your husband lied, again. "
"You should be worried. Not necessarily about your MIL, but because your husband said he wants to cheat again, and you're still thinking you can save your marriage. Why? You husband knows exactly what his mother was doing. She knows about his cheating, and she apparently supports it, possibly even enables it (by any chance, is your husband Chinese, and you not, and his mother wants him to be with ""one of his own?""), and she apparently wants you out of the picture and/or wants to you hurt you, and your husband is a-okay with all of that. He doesn't love or respect you.  

You need to get in touch with your feelings and your reasoning skills. You've been belittled and told lies for so long, and you've been pretending not to feel resentment for so long, and you've been sticking your head in the sand, ignoring anything that hints at the truth of your horrible husband and his family, because you want so badly to believe that there's some rational explanation for everything, and that he does love and respect you, and that you can have a happy life with him, but all that is a lie. You can't run from it anymore.

You think you're reaction was ""negative"" or ""self-damaging,"" but it wasn't. It's normal to feel bad when someone purposely does something mean and then when the person who should love you most doesn't even care that you're hurt, and even pretends that he didn't notice anything odd about the interaction, completely invalidating you as a person. That feeling you felt wasn't self-damaging, it was self-PRESERVATION. That feelings was YOU, the deep-down-inside you that you've been stifling for so many years, telling you to GET OUT of your dysfunctional marriage, to GET AWAY from this man who says he loves you but shows that he doesn't, and that actually shows you how much he doesn't even mind seeing you hurt. That feeling you felt was the inner you, begging to be allowed to be happy and free, away from toxic people.  How you stop yourself from reacting that way: By getting out of your marriage, and not interacting with the people who make you feel that way. Go to a therapist, and go to a divorce lawyer, and find some people who are on ""team you"" - friends, family, a divorce support group, whatever. Build a life away from toxic people like your husband and his family. I know it sounds scary now. I know you had dreams, a vision for what you life would look like, a vision that included a future with your husband, but your future with him won't be happy. You're not throwing that future away by building a life away from him, because that version of the future was never going to turn out the way you wanted it to. You have to let go of all of that. Grieve for the future you'll never have, and start building your own future, without him and his family. If you're not employed, figure out what you need to do to become self-sufficient, and how you can be supported in the meantime (maybe some of the following: finding a roommate to share expenses, getting a job, staying with family, government benefits, alimony, proceeds from your half of the assets in the divorce, selling some of your possessions, whatever else?), if you already have the means to support yourself, that's one big worry taken care of, and you can focus more on nourishing the emotional aspects of things to heal and move on and become fulfilled and happy on your own (and maybe look for a new partner when/if you're ready) - explore some new hobbies or take up old hobbies, renew friendships or make new friends, set some goals for yourself to keep your mind occupied, whatever. 

But seriously, that feeling you had wasn't just a cry for help, saying ""I can't take this anymore,"" it was also a rallying cry, a warriors cry, saying ""I deserve better, and I'm not going to wait around for things to change, for my husband to change, and for his family to change. I'M going to change! I'm going to build a happy and fulfilling life. And my happy and fulfilling life has no room in it for people who don't value me. I value me, and that's why I'm finally taking action."" You can do this. Start today."
"Your husband is lying to you... again. 

What an odd comment for your MIL to say if she didn't know anything. Also, since she does know and blatantly called out how she wasn't going to say more, in front of you, her son's *wife*, makes her an accessory to her son's cheating. So now you know that not only is he a garbage liar, but he was born to a garbage mother. She should be ashamed of him, and instead she's teasing him and goading you. That's gross, OP. I have no time for people like this and you shouldn't either.

Please get yourself to therapy to learn how to get away from these people."
"She either knows about the first affair or he had another (atleast one more) that his mom found out about. Being she was so nonchalant about it, it is possible she thinks you know/knew and/or he lied to her and said you allowed him to do it/are nonmonogamous with your husband. 

There are a lot of possibilities here, but one thing is sure: she knows he sleeps with/slept with a chinese women."
"Seriously, I'll never understand people who suspect cheating - and ask the person. If they're willing to lie to cheat, they're willing to lie to cover their ass. The only way to catch someone is be sneaky about it. My two cents."
"Which do you think is more plausible?  

Maybe you husband has always had a thing for Asian women going back to childhood, and maybe your MIL would be happy if the two of you broke up, and she's just shooting daggers.     

Or your husband is lying.    

I think your husband is lying, he just got better at hiding his affairs, who know maybe his mom caught him at the no-tell motel, so she may not know about  the cheating 10 years ago, but only knows about the cheating now.  "
No sorry I wasn‚Äôt clear. I knew that he wanted to do it again cuz that‚Äôs what he said in the email to her.
"Eh, he tried to deflect by getting lovey dovey. He knew exactly what his mother meant. He's lying to you somewhere in there, whether it is what MIL knows of the past or even of the present. She probably knows he has an Asian fetish, and I wouldn't be surprised if she enables the cheating by using her place.

I know a family friend who had something similar. The woman has 2 sons and loves to control them and be the center of attention. She felt threatened when they both got married especially if the wife had more 'power'. With both sons, she helped them cheat, even posing with her sons and the other women in pics. One son ended up getting divorce and is now living at home with her. He's in his 40s or 50s. The other son continues to cheat. His wife is in denial and refuses to leave him or even confront him, although it was their daughter who caught him and told everyone. She overheard a convo he had with the other woman and saw a pic of her father, with the other woman and his mother (her grandmother). 

That's their story. Not sure what your husband is hiding but his mother definitely knows at least something about his thing with Asian women. He could have at least been honest about that even if that is all she knew."
"I had a friend in high school who was in a really bad car accident and ended up with serious brain damage which resulted in a similar situation to what you are in. If you are going away to college I strong recommend just visiting once over winter/summer break. After the first year or so your visits will become even less expected, and by the time you graduate you will have other responsibilities/commitments they probably won't even be a thing.

I guess my point is if possible just fade out? If that makes sense. If you don't think that will work based on your own circumstances it may be something you sit down and talk to your mom about. With your friend's condition it may be something his mother needs to sit down and explain to him in a way he can understand."
"The thing is if you can't be there to support him indefinitely, that's ok. You can't be friends with someone you have nothing in common with anymore just out of guilt or a sense of obligation, it's not sustainable - that goes for any friendship. Nonetheless you will probably always think about him and feel a bit bad about how your lives diverged.. I had a schoolfriend who I was close to at 17, but she developed some really serious mental health issues and was sectioned eventually. We did a lot to keep in contact with her and try to help for the first few years, but ultimately it was something she was never coming back from. She's been in and out of mental health wards and supported housing for the last 15 years, and our lives just totally diverged. 

Every so often I'd see her in town and go for a coffee with her and she was never any better, talking about the same grudges she'd had at age 14 and how the doctors were conspiring against her, and not listening to me or amenable to any logic. It was kind of pointless keeping in contact, for either of our sakes. I still feel bad that it went that way, but there was no more fighting to be done for that dead friendship. 

You can go so far for someone, but if they're not coming back you just have to leave it for your own sanity. You can keep in loose contact and see how he does over the years if you want but don't beat yourself up trying to keep a friendship up that isn't sustainable. "
"> He seems to be perpetually stuck in 2014 too.. constantly making painfully unfunny jokes. Whenever I‚Äôm with him it.. I hate to say it but it feels like I‚Äôm talking to a 14 year old. 

Chances are the brain injury *did* stop him at 14, as you both age your bodies will grow but his cognition may always be stuck in this level of development. Brain injuries can drastically alter behaviour, personalities and make it difficult to read social cues, respond appropriately and fully articulate what he wants to express. It can be incredibly frustrating to feel trapped and unable to communicate the way you want to or to feel like something has been taken and never knowing if it can or will return.

I understand you want your ""old friend"" back, but you have to adjust to the new normal and celebrate the new future he is going to discover. Be empathetic and consider how you'd feel if the roles were reversed. You need to grieve who he was and accept who he is now, change is hard but it's just a reality.

You don't have to stay friends or stick around if you're not feeling it, but I would advise you to take more time and approach this from a new perspective before making any final decisions."
"Are you going to uni? Because once you go off to university or start working you will just be too busy to see him that often and there will just be the slow fade naturally.

"My (ex) stepdad's  lifelong friend got into a motorcycle accident (while he was with my stepdad) 

  Although there are many differences between these situations, his friend has a similar happy go lucky, infantile additide. 

  One thing to remember is that you are not his caretaker, you're his friend. Friends say things like ""please don't make jokes like that.""  And then talk about it. You can still have those types of boundary setting conversations (albeit a little modified) 

  You don't have to cater to his disability (and it's somewhat ableist to do so. )

  My stepdad sees his friend everytime he visits the area, and makes sure he has a good time, but they do things like go out for ice cream or get dinner with family members. The friend doesn't accompany him to the bar to meet up with the old gang... not because he's ""embarassing"" but because it's just not an appropriate place or company to be in anymore for the friend. 

  You can feel okay pulling back, but if you want to continue a friendship, do that, don't be his caretaker or police his behavior, just communicate on whatever level you can."
"Are the mom's putting pressure on you to stay close with you friend?  If they're not, go ahead and start the slow fade out.  If you see him casually, fine, but there's no need to make special plans to see him.

If the mom's are pushing you to see him, same thing.  Just truthfully tell them that you're busy with school, work, etc and just don't have the time to visit all the time anymore.

"
"you said it yourself, he's a different person now. your feelings for the person he used to be don't apply anymore. It's a tragic situation but you are never under any obligation to be friends with anyone, much less someone who is being consistently rude to you."
">He‚Äôs really rude to me - he keeps making comments putting me down. I think they are meant to be jokes but I don‚Äôt think he realises the offensiveness. 

Have you told him that his remarks come off as rude to you? If not, you need to. I wouldn't feel bad about distancing myself from him at all--he's not your responsibility and we don't owe anyone our friendship. But if you want to give things another stab and haven't tried just being straightforward with him, it's worth a shot."
Brain injuries are not easy on any one but to try n understand and be a part of his life is the right thing to do feeling alone and out casted makes it even harder to recooperate and one day he may catch up and be a friend to u just stay in touch once in a while its nice to catch up 
">there was no more fighting to be done
    
This is absolutely it.  A similar thing happened to a cousin of mine.  That person is gone and nothing I do is going to bring him back.  I'm not fighting for him by keeping up contact, I'm fighting my own emotional health.  Eventually you have to face the end of your former relationship to that person."
"When you break up with him, he's going to blame his hair and it will be true."
Yeah. This is really fucking weird. And a big red flag. He literally is suing someone and didn't tell you!
"I mean yes it's really weird and pretty alarming that he's so insecure about his hair, but that doesn't really explain why she automatically connected to your wifi, does it?"
"Ok like the hair thing is super bizarre but...

Why am I the only one extremely concerned about the WIFI connecting. Are there other signs of cheating? Are you sure it was your WiFi and not like a general ‚ÄúXfinity‚Äù or something (if your area has that) or an open one from another apartment? "
"He needs therapy, and a lot of it. Like, now.

I can't believe he got fired for suing his manager for discrimination for his hair and hasn't yet realized that he is ruining his life with his weird obsession.

If it were me, I'd cut him loose. A year and this kind of drama? Ugh."
"> Is this super weird to anyone else?

My neighbor's boyfriend had an emotional support turtle he was fired for smuggling into work. So, no, not the weirdest thing I have seen someone claim was against them. Turtle Guy swore people hated him for Speedy, or whatever the thing's name was. 

People all have weird things they hate about themselves. Your boyfriend has every right to feel his blonde hair prevents him from getting respect. A lot of people hate something about themselves. 

The issue is how far he takes it. Instead of dying his hair, shaving it off, or going to see a therapist to deal with this... he lied to you about a lawsuit, was fired, didn't tell you, switched jobs, still didn't tell you why... and still has the gall to claim his blonde hair is the reason for his failures. 

The moment a quirk becomes a roadblock and a red flag, you have to decide whether you can live with it or not. I don't think his focus on his hair is healthy and he needs therapy. But you aren't going to make him change overnight. It's going to be a long blame game. 

So you have to decide if you want to be part of that. 

I would probably leave over the lying, the questionable Wifi situation, and this focus on everyone else being the problem. People like that don't become honest suddenly.  


"
">Is this super weird to anyone else?

Is this normal to literally anyone reading? "
"Early/mid-twenties is around the age mental illnesses really show themselves.   


I get that your boyfriend has always been self-conscious about his blond hair, but trying to file a *lawsuit* against a boss for ""discrimination""? Against his blond hair??? That is, quite literally, insanity.  "
"Your BF‚Äôs issues have issues. This is nuts. Depending on what industry he is in, how big the city you live in is, etc. he could have perma-fucked his career over a paranoid delusion. 

People who have legitimate claims for actually illegal workplace discrimination risk get blacklisted for suing an employer. 
This dude sued his for allegedly discriminating against him for being blonde. He is going to be legendary for the degree of his persecution complex and bad judgment. 

Plus is this a race thing? Is he someone who thinks there is ‚Äúreverse racism‚Äù against white people? Does he think people are discriminating against him because he is too white? 

Many questions. I‚Äôd bail. 

Plus the fact that he sued his boss over some crazy shit doesn‚Äôt explain why the coworker had the password to your WiFi already stored in your phone. 

"
I would LOVE to see your boyfriend and a person of color talk about discrimination.  I would grab popcorn immediately. 
"""You're too....BLONDE!!!""  


‚Äì *Fight Club*"
"He kind of sounds paranoid, like needs to see a psychologist paranoid because at some point in his life he started using his hair color as a coping mechanism for fear of failure or shame or something? Very strange indeed. "
"Okay so apart from the fact that he is having women from work over without telling you,  


And apart from the fact that your relationship is so bad that you perused his computer rather than talk to him about this,  


And apart from the fact that he began a lawsuit and was fired without talking to you about it,  


And apart from the fact that your relationship is *so bad* that you talked to a coworker about *this* issue rather than talking to your boyfriend,  


And apart from the fact that he needs therapy about his hair,  


And apart from the fact that your relationship is *so bad* that you brought this to the internet rather than *talk to your boyfriend about it*...  


Why on earth did he dye his shocking blonde hair BLACK? He could choose a darker blonde? A light ash brown? A normal, natural hair colour that isn't the polar opposite of what he currently has?  


Look, none of your story is normal or sane. You need to sit him down and have a calm conversation about every part of this including why you felt the need to be a stalker/detective rather than just talk to him about his issues, and why it might be healthy for both of you to talk to someone (individually or as a pair, whatever he prefers) to work on his childhood abuse-related PTSD about his hair and to work on your very unhealthy relationship. "
"If you want to try to get through to him, you can sit him down and say that wasn't teased as a kid because he's blond. He was teased because he was insure. The other kids found out what his insecurity was and they teased him, because kids are assholes. 

But you should follow that up with a question about the cheating. "
I sue people because of my blonde hair all the time. I don‚Äôt see what the big deal is
Are you from a country that has people with predominantly dark hair?
He sounds bordering on delusional and narcissistic. You‚Äôve only been together a year. I would move on.
"I have red hair and the only time I bleached it was for a mohawk. I have never and will never use it as an excuse. Having red hair makes you way more of a target than blonde hair because red is very attention grabbing and rare, but if you own how you look nothing should bother you.

I think your boyfriend may need some phycological help. That mentality isnt healthy although not as uncommon as you think. If you dont run or get him help you will be stuck with a perminent victim for the rest of your life."
This is the whitest thing I have ever read. 
"Are you sure he‚Äôs not some kind of like...white supremacist who thinks we need to fight for ‚Äúwhite rights‚Äù or something? Just because this is so bizarre, and blonde hair is a prized symbol of whiteness by Aryan / neo nazi groups. Blonde hair is so desirable in western society many women, me included, spend hundreds of dollars a year dying their hair blonde. This is pretty much delusional."
"I wonder if he grew up with something put in his head about his hair color. Honestly I had a relative I've heard tell us growing up that certain people hate people with blue eyes and blond hair (which is what we had). As a kid, it kind of sticks with you and you start thinking ""is that true?"" ""Why?"" ""Do people hate ME because of that?"" I wonder if something like that happened with him. Or maybe he had a bullying experience before you even knew him where someone made fun of his hair and that affected him. If that's the case and he can't help feel that way, then it makes sense why he's acting that way. You can either accept that about him, try to help him with it, or get out of the relationship."
"Discrimination over hair color is not a thing, OP, so I highly doubt he will ever see a courtroom. But it sounds like you are dating a crazy person. This isn't someone who you want to be the father of you're children, if they inherit his blond hair he is going to have them blaming every one of their failures on their hair color."
What an unhealthy obsession.
"What the fuck 

OP if you want to be with someone who blames everything they do wrong on something/someone else, stay with him. Sounds exhausting to me."
Men with blond hair do get more ridicule from others then you might imagine. It can be maddening. It sounds like your BF lost and the world has ridiculed him to insanity. 
"This guy‚Äôs got 99 problems and his blond hair ain‚Äôt one. If he doesn‚Äôt seek therapy, you should break up with him. He‚Äôs going to blame every problem in his life and his relationship on his blond hair.

Not the point, but if he wanted to experiment, he could have dyed his hair brown rather than going to an extreme."
"Your bf has deep insecurities about his appearance and the blonde hair is simply the focus. 

Chances are he's not facing discrimination over being blonde, he's just projecting his own self-hatred onto others and is always on alert looking to be targeted and creates a confirmation bias. He's clearly in need of psychological help to unravel this paranoia and obsession.

This lawsuit will be an embarrassing failure that has already resulted in him losing his job. This needs to stop."

Try and dissuade him from taking such action and strong arm him into seeing a doctor, this is just stupid, now it's your time to act OP, that's if you're willing to see him through this and not break up with him. Just watch your back.

People sure subject themselves to some weirdos in relationships. More surprised you are stil with the red flag. 
I gotta see this hair lol
"Hair color is so easily changeable now that he‚Äôs an adult and has access to a salon or a better knowledge of hair dye. 

He stays blond because it gives him a reason that none of his failures are his fault. "
Could be something therapy would help with 
I mean it‚Äôs a stupid lawsuit but can you fire someone in retaliation for a lawsuit before the lawsuit is legally dismissed as frivolous?
Honestly this is one of the weirdest things I've ever heard. I have red hair and have had people make jokes but going so far as to sue someone for discrimination over hair? Is he mentally well?  Red flags everywhere 
"Dude, this is some weird self loathing. This WHOLE this is weird! Dying your hair suddenly black? Yeah, I‚Äôd have made fun of him too, you've got to go at these things gradually, and for gods sake, so to a salon and go subtly. The bigger thing... he is legitimately suing for discrimination because of his hair color?? This is so weird"
Really weird tbh. My husband has very blonde hair too but does not have this complex. You bf may want to see a therapist or something.
"Get this boy to a therapist, stat. He has some deep seated issues regarding his hair that need to be addressed."
"Break up with him - he's delusional, lacking any sense or reason, self centered and us essentially a living caricature of an entitled privileged white man"
Also why can't he just buzz his hair and keep it very short. See that's a normal thought process - not constantly getting fired and suing....
"I'm a ginger/strawberry blonde and I never sued anyone for constantly making obvious remarks about it, so he's a little...dramatic. But since he didn't tell you about it he probably knows he's being crazy over it."
"This is the quality content I come to this subreddit for. Yes it's hella weird. Get away get away. Don't go with him to therapy, insist he go to therapy solo and break up with him. You don't need this.

Also make sure your next boyfriend is also blonde, that'll freak him out."
"One of the best-looking men on the planet, also a successful author and researcher, on TV all the time, also a bar owner, also a professor, is a blond.  Spencer Wells.  Image-google him.  I mean RROWR."
"This was my first thought lol.

Run OP."
"Right? Oh hello self-fulfilling prophecy, there you are my old friend."
This made me chortle.
"She‚Äôs hair today, gone tomorrow!"
Haha I lol on this one üòÇ
That's a hair raising thought!  
"And he's going to lose, too. "
"Also, he's suing someone for a bullshit reason: he is projecting his own issues and failures onto others as discrimination so that he can be the victim. (Oh, if I failed the English essay, if I'm not getting what I want at work, it's not because I did a bad job it's because I'm blonde and they're just persecuting me. I'm so persecuted! Failures aren't my fault!)

Honestly, I would find this SUPER unattractive and pretty concerning. Unless he can recognize this is an issue and is willing to get some therapy (doubt it) I don't think I'd date him.

I assume the co-worker didn't reveal some shocking info to the effect of he was facing obvious ant-blonde um, ism? "

Right? The story just trailed off that subject even though it's a big red flag.
"This. Sounds like he's insecure, vain, prone to lying by omission about important things, and likely cheating on OP.

Is she blonde?  Perhaps she just understands him /s
Could be Wi-Fi Sense. Windows 10 will automatically share your wifi login with outlook contacts. I believe there is also a similar thing on iphones. 
"Well, I had a talk with him about everything I‚Äôd found out and he basically had a huge meltdown. There was screaming, wailing, a dry heaving in his end. I tried to be strong and supportive and I suggested to him that he needs therapy. And he agreed we could go to therapy together 

I couldn‚Äôt bring up the cheating last night, he was crying too much and like lying on the floor screaming then he drank a whole bottle of wine and threw up everywhere. Still cleaning that up, whole house smells"
"Nope, you're not the only one. I would be extremely concerned about the Wi-Fi too. She was definitely in OPs apartment without her knowing it, for long enough that having Wi-Fi was a necessity.  "
I think you're reading way too much into it. Getting WiFi passwords from friends is completely normal and having their WiFi password saved on your phone and assuming cheating is a colossal jump.
Well recently I found out if you have someone‚Äôs phone number and they are already connected to WiFi it sends a message to them asking to share their WiFi with you with just a click of a button on your phone. I know this happens on iPhones. 
"When my friends come over and they try to connect to my WiFi, all they have to do is click on the wifi name and then it will pop up on my phone and say ‚Äúfriend‚Äôs name wants to connect to WiFi. Share now?‚Äù He could have allowed her to be on WiFi without OP noticing because it would just be on his phone. This is the iPhone btw. "
Are you sure that his boss hadn't made blonde jokes about his intelligence previously?
">emotional support turtle

I'm sorry, just...what."
My brother had a turtle named Speedy who somehow ran away while my other brother was watching our two turtles outside.  I imagine it‚Äôs a fairly common name for turtles.
"I think you hit the nail on the head with your last sentence - it's weird that he's obsessing about his hair, but more important is the fact that he *genuinely* believes everything wrong in his life is someone else's fault. He's not taking any responsibility for the consequences of his own actions, and someone like that doesn't change. Sure, therapy might help him get over the hair issue, but dollars to donuts he'll find some other scapegoat to blame... And if OP sticks around, that scapegoat could very well be her. "
SPEEDY üò≠ I‚Äôm literally dying I love this so much
"It's also around the time his hair will likely change colour. My cousins had bright blond hair when they were younger, now it's much more of a sandy light brown colour. 

There are so many better things to give two craps about. "
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs because he‚Äôs white‚ÄîI believe his mother mocked him about being blond as a child because no one else in their family is blond. And so that led to him being very sensitive about it but it really does not seem normal to be this bad

There is nothing like that on iPhone. Otherwise I‚Äôd be out of data since I have all my pogo friends in my contacts. 
Uh.........this guy has MAJOR psychological issues. Is this how he always reacts to conflict? I can't imagine he's generally a stable guy.
"OP, he needs individual therapy too‚Äînot just as a couple. But his reaction to being confronted about his lawsuit is worrisome. He honestly sounds very unstable. And also don‚Äôt tiptoe around this WiFi issue to preserve his feelings. From what you‚Äôve said, there are no good reasons for her to have automatically connected."
"> I suggested to him that he needs therapy. And he agreed we could go to therapy together

That's him acting like it's a problem with the relationship, not with his behaviour specifically. The issue is 100% on him: his obsession/insecurity with his hair, his extreme overreactions (lawsuits, tantrums, panic attacks). 

I think you should take some space from him for the time being. Move in with a friend or family member for a little while, take some time away from his special breed of insanity. Plan your next move, including whether you go with him to therapy. But if you do go, do it with the intention of going as emotional support for him as he owns up to his own issues and takes responsibility. If he starts trying to spin it as ""we're both responsible for this issue in our relationship"", then you know the relationship is over. "
Wow I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre helping him. He sounds like he might have way bigger issues beneath the surface.
OP this is the time to cut and run. This guy is unbalanced. You're cleaning up after him?! Come on.
"OP's router ~~will~~ should have detailed connection logs. It would be easy enough for her to see how far back this goes, and at which specific times/dates anyone in the building was establishing a connection."
So have you ever hung out with a platonic friend in their apartment before?
"I agree it could be other things that you‚Äôve posted 

However, even though they‚Äôve only been dating a year she said they‚Äôve been friends since their teens, and yes while I don‚Äôt know all of my friends coworkers if this girl has been in his life for a while and over his house I just feel like OP would know that. It seems like it was off or strange enough for her to mention it in the post. 

It‚Äôs obviously weird enough or off enough for it to be mentioned. I think that if he had this job for 3 years and his own place and was known to have coworkers over she wouldn‚Äôt be wondering why that happened or notice it at all. If this is the first time this coworker has been over in over a year maybe she is newer to the job. She clearly is under the impression the coworker hasn‚Äôt been over before hence her mentioning  it which is why I brought it up. 

It also might not be infidelity though. Maybe OP is getting the feeling they‚Äôve slept together or had something before she got with her bf... which would also be a cause for concern for not telling OP he had a ‚Äúrelationship‚Äù with woman "
Yeah but getting someone‚Äôs WiFi password before you‚Äôve been to their house?
"His English teacher too? And all his friends?  And they must have made fun of everyone else with blonde hair too, right?

If you're seeing something *everywhere* that no one else sees, it might be you."
ive never heard a blonde joke direct at a man. is that even a thing?
"Ah yes, I forgot hair color is a protected class."
"He carried around a turtle, maybe it was a tortoise I'm not really sure. But yeah, he had a box he kept it in and took it everywhere. It was a little weird. "
You could also always shave it real close-cropped like many men wear their hair and then the color would be a lot less obvious.
Yeah there's no excuse for this. Also the Wi-Fi connected because he's cheating on you. It's not uncommon witg highly insecure men.
"He has probably also heard every dumb blond joke in the book from both friends and strangers.

It‚Äôs one of the things that happens when you have light blond hair.   So without support to deal with the mean jokes it doesn‚Äôt seem to have turned out well for him.  "
It‚Äôs still not a normal response. Especially since he could have gone and gotten it professionally dyed by now (a color that‚Äôs not super obvious like black).
"what a horrible mother. And the fact that nobody else in family is blond, maybe your bf should do a DNA test with his father"
I will fly anywhere in the world op is and interview her (soon to be ex) bf for this.
"Nah, I mean in that case he can turn it around and say 'well I bet they hate their own blonde hair too and they're taking it out on me because I'm blonde'.

Calling it now."
That would be some fantastic poetic justice.
"Well obviously the judge's hair is ""very bright light wheat chataigne"", which is completely different from blonde even though it looks similar at first glance. "

But why would his gf who lives with him not know about it?
">It‚Äôs obviously weird enough or off enough for it to be mentioned

I think it's also worth considering OP herself though. Her default response to a simple WiFi password issue was to snoop on his computer rather than asking BF about it first. No offense to OP but that's not exactly a healthy response and it makes her sound like an unreliable witness with re: signs of untrustworthiness."
"Nothing about the post says she's never been to his house, just that OP has never met her before. "
Maybe he uses a common password across all his devices and she knew this & put it in herself?
"Right.  That old adage of, ""If everyone you meet all day is an asshole, *you're* the asshole."""
"Did you not read the part where the ""friends"" made fun of him to the point where he dyes his hair, still gets teased so he shaves it off and grows his hair back?"

"Still plenty of other things it could be.

This is just the first time that OP has met the coworker, not the first time OP heard of coworker. Doesn't sound like BF is hiding coworker from OP.

Furthermore they've only been dating for a year which is not that long in their lives. OP could have very well invited coworkers to his apartment before they started dating as well (since he hosted a dinner for them it wouldn't be out of the question). WiFi passwords do persist as well. I have passwords from five years ago across multiple phones since simply from Google saving the passwords on their end and syncing it to my phone.

Might be something, might not, but I still say that immediately saying this sounds like infidelity is a *major* leap.

Shieldtoads üò≠ I adore how literal German is. Like the first guy to see a turtle was like huh this looks like a toad with a shield... What shall we call it? Shieldtoad!
"That's weird. Here in Britain, tortoises are land animals, and turtles are sea animals.

I love ""shieldtoad"", btw. German is such a great language. Love those compound nouns."
Every time I‚Äôve seen this word in the thread my eyes read it as shitload. There‚Äôs something about this word that gives me dyslexia!
Your ESL teacher is completely wrong. 
Schildkr√∂te is my favourite German word by far. I often drop it into everyday conversation.
"Turtles live almost their whole lives in the water (only really coming out to lay eggs), terrapins split their time more evenly. Tortoises cannot swim at all. "

"No.   Somethoughts44 is correct that wifi and data are not the same thing.



jamiemaxlee is confirming that WiFi share is an option on ios11, not that wifi and data are the same thing.



In this case the wifi means the wifi network password/key, like your home wifi password broadcast from your wireless router.  Not a hotspot from your phone.  

Data is your cellular plan specifically.  

You probably could combine the two and setup a wifi hotspot on your phone and burn your data, but yeah that'd be bad.


If you have a password/key iOS11 has an optional feature which prompts you to share with friends/contacts.
The function is on by default in Windows and shares automatically if I remember right.


The issue with a scenario as follows:

Say you're at home and you authorize Bill granting him your key for your wifi (again this is not your cellular data plan).  Bill's a decent guy.



Later Ted visits your house, but Ted is a shifty dude you don't want having access to your wifi.  Ted could get the key from Bill regardless of whether Bill chooses to share your wifi's key or if it happened automatically when they're both in range of the same wireless router.



Next thing you know Ted is doing stuff with your internet connection you REALLY don't want traced back to your home internet account.

"They also call lightbulbs ‚Äúglow pears,‚Äù because German is amazing."
I read it as figurative.   The German language tends to combine a lot of concepts within its nouns that paint an image of what the word means.

Nope. I keep my door close 80&#37; of the time I'm in my room. There's nothing wrong with needing privacy or your own space.
"Nope, nothing wrong with having your door closed. I'm an introvert too so I understand completely...but different households have different norms so it may just be weird to them because they haven't seen it before.

And no, you're not wrong to want to move out, either. Living by yourself is one of *the best things ever* as an introvert. It's very peaceful. "
"I was the same way after I moved in with my aunt and uncle and cousins. My family was pretty distant. On the second night my cousin commented, ""Well, there goes werdbruthuh being antisocial again!"" And I was like ""screw you, I can be social"". And now I know what being a part of a loving family is like.

Anyway, it's probably not abnormal, but your aunt and cousin may have a closer family dynamic. "
"Nothing wrong at all. However if they are doing you a favor(and you aren't quite sure when this favor will end) you may want to both stand by your right to have your personal space while at the same time being diplomatic. Maybe when you spend time with them remind them that you enjoy their company, or plan out some specific activities that you know you will all enjoy. It's very kind of them to take you in for an unknown amount of time. It doesn't mean you need to abandon your personal needs, but you might want to keep an eye on this. Again you aren't wrong, but there are some layers here. You are absolutely right that living on your own will be a great thing for you. Good luck!"
"Probably from someone who doesn't close doors it's seen as being uninviting. Though I do close doors myself, there was a time where I lived with a guy who barely came out of his room. It was awkward to interact with him because you didn't know what he was thinking. 

Maybe as a compromise stay some time being antisocial in the living room so they could feel more comfortable being in your space."
Not having closed doors is much much wierder. Everyone should be allowed to have some private space and time.
"It's not UNnormal, but in some households doors are kept open by default, and doors are only closed when the occupant specifically wants to keep people out.  Sounds to be the case in your new home."
I basically lived in my room and i normally got along fine with my family. I LOVE living alone and I'll never have roommates if i can help it. 
"Wanting alone time is 100% ok. Are you living with them for free? If so, they're doing you a big favor, just humor them a little by coming out to chat with them now and then, and move out asap."
"They don't need to be comfortable with it, they don't even need to understand it, they just have to accept it. You like being closed off from the world occasionally, and you can't have that serenity if your door is open. End of story. You don't need to be rude or blunt about it, but you don't have to back down either, and you're not doing anything wrong - it's just your own personal choice about your own personal space. "
">they just have to accept it 

No, they don't. They took her into their home as a favour. If she doesn't like it, then she can leave. "
"My point is that they can say ""we're uncomfortable with it"" but it's not on OP to actually make a change. And from what she's written they're not forcing her to open the door, they're just saying they're uncomfortable. Well...they'll get used to it. "
"Eh I'm with u/ChaoticxSerenity, when you're an adult and relatives are letting you stay with them for free, it's good form to humor them a bit. OP should come of out his/her room now and then to chat, shouldn't be a big deal."
"I have an entire drawer of photos from the past three years. And a lot of those contain photos of my last two exs. They're in there but I never look at them but I don't think I could ever throw them away. I'm not sure why. Maybe it's because I learned a lot about myself from those relationships. And to be completely thruthful it's nice to see old memories when they did make me happy if I just come accross them cleaning or something. My bf knows I have them but he doesn't mind. I also have a pretty big fear of throwing away photos because it feels like if I did then the memories never happened and that freaks me out. 

Talk to your boyfriend he may have similar feelings. As long as they're not explicit I wouldn't have a problem with it. But if it makes you uncomfortable regardless let him know and you can chat through it."
"It depends. I still have some photos from when I was with my ex, I never look at them, but I don't want to delete them. I actually regret deleting some pictures I have from when I was with my first boyfriend, just because of the nice memories from those times. If they are explicit photos, he should delete them as those are 1. inappropriate 2. I doubt she would want him to still have those photos. It is okay to be upset, but remember that everyone has different feelings about their memories and breakups. Some are scorched earth about it and delete all trace of them, some keep photos/mementos. 

I think you should try to have a mature conversation about it (""I feel"" statements, etc.) because it is making you upset. Wait a little until you feel a bit better about it all, and try to have a conversation. You could try saying something like, ""BF, I really care about us, and I don't want you to feel the need to lie about having pictures of you and your ex. We can't change the past. When you got mad at me, I felt [how you felt] and when you told me you didn't want me to know you had them, I felt [how you feel]. I trust you, and I want us to make memories together.""

You gotta talk out your problems together and move forward. It seems like he just didn't go about it in the right way and he reacted badly about it all."
"If they're normal photos (not explicit) then it's normal to keep them, it was a part of his life. But he shouldn't keep any r-rated pics."
He had them put away where you couldn‚Äôt see him. You don‚Äôt get to decide hin saving pictures is harmful. It‚Äôs his past you don‚Äôt just get to erase it. 
"/u/lacrosse\- is right. It's not having the pictures that is the problem, it's that he went so far as to tell you not to look to hide the fact that he kept them. "
">I asked him why he still had them?

Because in 20 years when neither you nor the ex is still in the picture, he'd like to remember his life 20 years back.

However if explicit, that might be another issue altogether.

"
"Yes it‚Äôs normal to keep me pictures of exes. No, you shouldn‚Äôt be upset about it. It doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôs not over her. We can appreciate memories of people and still not want to be with them. You are insecure and this is a you problem. Work on being more confident in yourself and believing in your own value. "
"My husband had pics of times with his exes, as do I. He, however, was very hesitant to let me know he had them when we first started dating because the lady he dated before me insisted that he destroy said pictures and went to far as to try cutting pictures of his exes out of printed photographs.

I wonder if fear was partly motivating your BF.

My spouse had a life before me, and I had one before him. I don't think that destroying evidence of that is helpful. I went through bad breakups and still have pictures of me doing things with my exes because it was good at the time. All those relationships were a growing experience that eventually lead me to my spouse, and for that I am grateful.

Talk to him about why he felt compelled to hide them, but if they are not explicit then I don't see why you would be upset that he has pictures from his past, beyond minor jealousy."
"Talk to him. Sounds like he either still has feelings or doesnt want to let the memories go. At 19 i cant imagine it's too much but yea, talk to him, dont overthink yourself to death,  better you talk out your worries"
"How long have you two been together? 

I was in the same situation a few years ago within the first year of my relationship. My boyfriend had tons of photos on his computer, which did include a few ex-girlfriends. None were NSFW, but it still bothered me. 
I told him a few times that I didn‚Äôt like it, but it didn‚Äôt really help until I sat him down and told him I was downright uncomfortable with seeing that on his computer and in our lives together. He has since deleted all of them. "
"You are right to be upset but it is somewhat normal that he keeps the photos. Understand that this was someone he (likely) loved, even if it ended on bad terms.

You're likely not the only woman in the world he could ever love and he's not the only man you could ever love, but the circumstances say that *now* you both choose to stay together for each other, and ultimately that's what matters."
Honestly all relationships will be a part of someone. I got rid of all my pictures and mementoes of an ex it ended poorly because it helped me to get over it but first I kept them because I did at one point love him and that love was part of me. I think if I'd wanted to I'd be within my rights to keep any pictures even explicit ones in a new rleationship as long as I wasn't using them to obsess over or for sexual pleasure. It's normal to keep mementoes from those we have loved and since we can never get those experiences or memories back it's all the more reason.
I have old gifts and Valentine‚Äôs Day card from my ex that I haven‚Äôt the heart to throw away. I don‚Äôt talk to him anymore and I got rid of our pictures when we broke up. I think I might get rid of the cards but I don‚Äôt wanna bother finding them lol. The rest is more of a souvenir from that time. No lingering feelings but just a memory. 
"You can absolutely decide that your partner intentionally hiding something, especially pics of another woman, is something you want no part of.

Even if you don't think it's a big deal, he still believed it was and chose to hide it."
Hence why I never asked him to delete them. Doesn‚Äôt change the fact that it hurts.
It frightens me that you feel both qualified to give relationship advice and also that it's somehow troubling someone would want privacy. 
How are you supposed to be confident when your partner is intentionally hiding pictures of another woman from you? It's not insecurity that makes that upsetting.
"But a lot of times people are told to put away old memorbelia when a new relationship starts. I don't think people owe it to their partner to share everything about their past, including old pictures. 

I would find nothing harmful about him having old relationship pictures, unless they were sex tapes. "
Maybe he just doesn't want OP to think about it. We don't know if his reason for hiding it is malicious.
I don't know if he was intentionally hiding them because it was wrong to keep them but maybe he just felt awkward about it. He handled it clumsily because he made it seem like they are something to be guilty over like he's still obsessing over them. You should tell him that and say hey look if you'd just said by the way there's some pictures of my ex on here and I don't have the heart to delete them but I also don't want to share them because they just feel like a private part of my past so could you wait while I find this photo it wouldn't have been as odd.
"This isn't a therapy session - you don't need a license to give others your perspective here.

It's a subreddit for relationship advice. Get over yourself. "
"It‚Äôs not just ‚Äúanother woman‚Äù, it‚Äôs an ex. People keep pictures of exes. It‚Äôs sentimental. Saying it‚Äôs ‚Äúanother woman‚Äù makes it sound like he‚Äôs cheating which you have no evidence of. Don‚Äôt exaggerate normal behaviour. Its his pictures, and his property. He can show it or not. Maybe he knows she‚Äôs insecure and didn‚Äôt want to upset her over nothing. My point is you don‚Äôt know, so don‚Äôt assume the worst. "
"Once again, it's not the fact that he has pictures, it's the fact that he's trying to hide them. Any advice of putting away things from a previous relationship, doesn't include lying or keeping secrets. At least not healthy advice. 

If he wasn't trying to purposefully hide it, he'd just say ""oh these are old pictures"" and move on like it's not a big deal. But that's not how he handled it and showed that he's the type of person to hide things to avoid trouble. That's not a good quality in a partner."
I can safely assume anyone trying to hide something isn't being noble about it 99.99% of the time. There's no excuse not to be open and honest with your partner.

Which is why I gave mine, that some people shouldn't be giving advice. "
"just tell him you like him! i get the concern about moving away but even without attaching a label you would definitely both miss each other. you're kind of... already in a relationship, even if you haven't specifically mutually defined it. that, or I'm sure it'll come up organically, especially if you keep doing all the things that people in relationships do."
He wants to be in a relationship with you but is afraid to bring it up. You want to be in a relationship with him but are afraid to bring it up. News flash: you‚Äôre already in a relationship! Have the discussion! He will be overjoyed. Deal with the long distance issue when you have to!
Why can't you talk to him like you are to us?
"I started dating my current partner like 15 hours after he broke with his ex, and he explicitly told me we were casual and that he couldn‚Äôt jump into anything. I spent four months basically living with him, and then moved across the country for six months for school. We both kind of had break downs when i left, and realized the relationship had become a lot more important to both of us. We‚Äôve been living together three years now. 
If it‚Äôs for a planned amount of time and you can make 1-2 trips back to visit, long distance is not impossible and is totally worth it for someone you like spending your time with. "
Don't make the decision for him: maybe he really likes you and would consider the long distance worth it! You'll never know unless you ask.
"Lol I‚Äôve had a relationship like this and he wanted to be friends with benefits. We just got really close and we‚Äôre...best friends with benefits. Talk to him. 

I‚Äôm still best friends with the guy btw. Just without the benefits. "
"It's weird because we tell each other pretty often how we like each other, but somehow avoided the ""relationship"" part altogether. When I returned from my internship, he cooked for me one night, and I was hugging him from behind, and he teased me ""you liiiiiiiiike me."" "
"What a typically me move to end up in a relationship without even realizing, lol. "
"Yeah, I do feel like we‚Äôre already doing a lot of things couple do, but without putting a label on it. I‚Äôm just not entirely sure how to bring it up. We always have a lot of fun together and I think this is a super serious discussion. (We do have serious conversations, and have shared a lot of personal things, but this somehow feels different) "
"Like I said, I'm afraid to ruin the balance. The distance is also an issue. 

I think it's unfair for me to ask him to ""wait"" for me, per se, but I also think it's unfair to me that I'm going along with the current situation without a clear explanation :( "
"Ahh, this is exactly my situation! We first started hooking up in January, and he had just broken up with his ex in December... we never really explicitly talked about it, but pretty early on he mentioned he wasn‚Äôt looking for a relationship because he thought he was a little fed up with that. However... yeah seriously I feel like we already do what couples do anyway. I feel really weird about PDA, but if we‚Äôre parting ways outside (to work/school, etc) I would kiss him goodbye. 

I am definitely seriously considering a long distance relationship. However, i feel like my reasons are selfish: I‚Äôm afraid if I play it too cool (‚Äúlets date if we‚Äôre both still single when I come back‚Äù is kind of what I had been planning on asking him) he would actually find someone else and settle down. Not sure if this mindset is healthy or fair or not... "
"tbh, you'll likely just hit a point where describing him as your boyfriend becomes a more convenient explanation for why he's coming with you to things. by the sounds of it, he's not gonna kick up any fuss about that."
"Maybe he's nervous to say he wants to be in a relationship with you too? He didn't tell his friend you weren't his girlfriend, he said he wasn't sure. If he wasn't interested in a relationship he would know. But he can't know what you want when you guys aren't willing to have ""the talk"".

Also, he's hinted about exclusivity. If he's hinting, he wants it but is afraid to bring it up. Especially if you've never been in a relationship before maybe he's worried you'd say no, then it would be awkward, and he'd lose you or you wouldn't want to spend as much time with him anymore to not lead him on.

Just talk to him. Tell him you'd like to be official and exclusive. (The more cowardly way is to ask him if he wants to be official and exclusive without saying your feelings first.) Then, be honest about your concerns too. Tell him you do want to be his boyfriend but you are worried it is unfair given you will have to leave work soon. But you realized you'd probably miss each other when you left either way, so there's no point in pretending now. And you guys can talk about what you want to do about you leaving. (You can always break up when you leave or during long distance if it's not working.) "
"When you're having the discussion about the state of your relationship, just make sure you clearly lay out that you'll be away all of next year. If you'd be okay trying long distance for that year, you can mention that too.

He's a grown man, capable of making decisions. If he decides to try the LDR (if that's something you'd want), or even just to put things on hold and ""wait"" for you to get back, that's not you ""making him"" him do anything. That's him making his own choices."
">so we will not be in the same city.

If you tell him how you feel you will give him a chance to look at things in a new way - perhaps if he knew how you felt about him he would join you where you're going. Why don't you half-serious, half-jokingly ask him to join you. He totally will and you guys are going to move in together and get married eventually."
"Just be honest. He‚Äôs had time to play the field, he‚Äôs clearly still interested in you. Let him know you‚Äôd like to continue this while you‚Äôre away and then pick it back up when you‚Äôre home. It‚Äôs not selfish, that‚Äôs definitely a concern i had when leaving and although we weren‚Äôt exclusive when i left we ended up becoming exclusive after like two months. "
"How disappointing. I guess I‚Äôd ask myself if it was worth the potential drama/loss of friendship that might ensue if you confront her. In my opinion, pet-sitting is a lot of responsibility, especially with the boundaries you set, and it‚Äôs important to 100% trust the person you ask to watch your pets. She might not have taken your requirements seriously, or may not have cared enough to let them affect how she wanted to live her life. I know that‚Äôs irritating, but you can‚Äôt do anything about it now. 

If there are no long-term ramifications to your cats‚Äô lives from this short stint in a less-than-ideal setting, I‚Äôd just chalk it up to a lesson learned. Maybe next time, find a friend whose lifestyle is more in line with the kind of place you feel comfortable leaving your animals, or a reputable pet sitter. "
Just make a mental note that she can‚Äôt take care of your cats anymore. Free pet-sitters are always worth what you pay for them. 
"""Hey, I saw on Instagram that a lot of people have met my kittens. I know they're adorable, but would you please limit their exposure to strangers? They get spooked easily and I wouldn't want them to be stressed."""

I think it would be fine to say something to her. 
"You should absolutely say something to her, especially given the weed around them. Marijuana can be poisonous to cats. Animals don't react to the smoke the way humans do. Some people think it's cute to smoke around their pets, but it can have potentially deadly ramifications."
"The sad this is that I did 100% trust her; I've known her for years and she's always been an actively good friend to me. 

We've talked before about how she's really a total introvert and likes the idea of hanging out with people but when it happens she always wishes she could be alone in her room, and the night I dropped them off and explained the boundaries, she made a joke about how this was a good excuse for her to not see anyone for a week.

I don't think this will have any long-term effect on them and I think you're right that I should just know better next time, but a part of me does want to say something just so she knows that I'm aware she didn't respect my/their boundaries and that I'm disappointed, and I think it might eat at me if I don't, but I guess I can give it a week or so and see how I feel then."
"Okay, yeah, that‚Äôs irritating, and sad. I think you‚Äôre totally justified if you choose to say something to her then. 

On a positive note, maybe she inadvertently helped socialize your kitties and they won‚Äôt have such anxiety around strangers now üò¨"

Stuff like this doesn't get better over night... and it's possible it'll never get better. You both have to take responsibility for your actions and work on your communication and listening skills.

"Jesus, what a clusterfuck.  You‚Äôre *both* being awful to each other.  You both clearly have years of resentment built up, and your relationship is going to just get progressively shittier until you (both) learn how to address that in a healthy way.  With so much baggage, that means you won‚Äôt get anywhere without couples counseling to help you mediate the issues.  

Also, maybe it‚Äôs just me so take this with a grain of salt, but it sounds like there is something very very wrong with your sex life.  In particular, your wife doesn‚Äôt want to be intimate with you.  What‚Äôs up with that??  You know, it‚Äôs pretty common for women to be unable to reach orgasm through intercourse, but why isn‚Äôt she letting you help her use her toys, or at least watch her get herself off?  Is it because you don‚Äôt *want* to do those things with her?  Because that would paint the scenario in a somewhat different light.

But to address your original question:  yes, indeed, one or both of you might benefit from benefit from some psychiatric medication.  But that‚Äôs something for your respective doctors to figure out with you.  "
">I have anger issues sometimes but I don‚Äôt see anyone or take anything for it.

I see you here admitting to having anger issues, which can be helped a lot by therapy (just for your own well-being, life is a lot nicer when you're not angry all of the time). Seeing a therapist sounds like a great idea.  

Even if you didn't address you anger issues at all, it sounds like living with your wife can be stressful, and a therapist can help you deal with that stress in healthy ways."
sounds like it wouldn‚Äôt hurt you to talk to your own therapist. what exactly is the downside to doing that? 
"I think if you want your relationship to succeed, you both need to see couples therapy. The way you both behave is unhealthy and immature. "
"Sorry man, but she is gaslighting the fuck out of you. As much as I adored my late wife, she pulled shit like this on the regular and would constantly make me blame myself for it all. She had borderline personality disorder and from the snapshot you‚Äôve given here, I am guessing your wife does too. They have an uncanny ability to manipulate their therapists to see things in their own warped view. Unfortunately, this is likely not going to change unless your wife commits to an honest and hard therapy regiment. Best of luck to you "
I was totally on your side until you locked her out of the house. You frankly just come off as angry and passive aggressive in this post. Her behaviour to you is obviously horrible but you aren‚Äôt that much better. She has a serious unmedicated mental illness so unless and until she can go back on some form of medication I don‚Äôt see how this improves - unless perhaps you totally refuse to engage in her excessive behaviour. You admit to punching holes in walls and having anger issues so yes you definitely need therapy. She definitely needs medication. I dont really see the resolution here until those things happen.
"It sounds like you‚Äôre trying to keep calm about a lot of stressful things and then losing the pilot. Your wife is treating you abominably. You are being awful to her. Seeing a therapist would be a good idea, but what would be your goal? It seems you want to find out whether you‚Äôre ‚Äòthe problem‚Äô in your marriage. But it‚Äôs very clear that you‚Äôre both the problem. What are your plans for if/when your wife‚Äôs behaviour becomes more dangerous? What are your aspirations for sorting out your marriage? A therapist could probably help with that. But you may also want to talk to a social worker. And you should talk to your wife‚Äôs psychiatrist or care team.

I don‚Äôt get why you don‚Äôt leave the room after sex, though. Your wife is waiting to get off. Your presence is going to irritate her until she does. I‚Äôm not sure I could take that way of approaching sex, myself, and I can see why you haven‚Äôt been interested lately. But it does seem sensible to face that this is the reality in the short term, and then think about whether you want to stay in this relationship under these conditions. "
"You're a nurse. You've taken mental health classes and exams.   

You KNOW this is not healthy. I'm so sorry you're going through this. I honestly think you need to leave AND get therapy. You deserve a truly happy and fulfilled life, which none of this is. "
"It sounds like you are making radical changes to your actions and behavior to cater to your wife.  Consider that she may be controlling and manipulative.

"
"I agree, I don't see anything good here.

> I get halfway there and she texts me that she‚Äôs going out, which usually means she‚Äôs pissed and going to drive around for hours until she doesn‚Äôt hate me anymore.

Can you imagine being in a relationship where one partner hating the other is this normalized?"
"She‚Äôs not violent, just reeeally angry. I only tried to include every detail for context and honesty. I don‚Äôt want to paint her red like she says those things all the time, but I agree therapy seems to be the all-or-nothing here. Thank you for your honesty. "
Thank you for your honesty. 
We used the diet to transition her off of them for the pregnancy. Her doc was on board. She was doing fine before the pregnancy. Which is why I feel like I‚Äôm the toxic one.  Thank you for your input. 
"To put it briefly, it doesn‚Äôt work for her unless she‚Äôs alone. "
Never said there was one. And I don‚Äôt have one yet. I gotta find one that‚Äôs for certain. Do I need a physician referral for my insurance to cover it?
This could be so. Thank you for your advice. 
">like she says those things all the time, 

i'm SURE she doesn't say this all the time, it's STILL a huge problem  and you confirm my theory , you are normalizing this crazy behaviour.This is NOT normal."
"Nobody but nobody has the right to talk to you like that.  Nobody, never, not even once."
"Couples therapy might help. I had a partner with some abusive tendencies and some signs of personality disorder.  Her personal therapy didn't help our relationship at all. But relationship therapy helped us both learn how to communicate and listen and deescalate. It ultimately didn't save our relationship, but it did make us better at relationships in general. And I've been super grateful for what I've learned because now I'm a much better partner and I can see and appreciate people who treat me well. 

Fixing this kind of thing takes a lot of work. And you both have to be on board and take responsibility for how your actions make the situations harder. She has to be up for the hard work of looking at her actions and not allow being bipolar to be an excuse. "
"Does her doctor know about these wild mood swings? It doesn‚Äôt sound like your keto diet has worked out all that well, unfortunately."
It depends on your insurance.
"Couples therapy is generally not recommended for abusive relationships because it demands that both parties accept part of the blame, and a lot of abusers will take that idea and go, ""Half of this is your fault and you just need to learn to not provoke me."""
"Again it was working great, but she stopped the diet soon as the pregnancy cravings started, and refuses to go back until birth. What her doctor knows is unknown to me I don‚Äôt go with her. "
"Alright, first of all, NEVER call yourself a loser, okay? Don't put yourself down like that. What you say, you believe and what you believe, you say.

Here are some pointers to know whether she likes you or not:  
Try to notice how much energy and effort she puts in your conversations.

Irl try to focus on her body language(whether she plays with her hair, the way her hips are positioned, look at her eyes, where she looks). Basically, if she's turned towards you and has an ""open"" body posture, you're good.

Over text it's more difficult to know because, and I know you don't wanna hear this, but it might not even be her texting you. Notice in her words whether she's using ""us"" and ""we"".

The most you can pull out of a conversation is how she responds to your texts. But don't get too clingy or needy if she doesn't reply right away. Like I said, see how much energy she puts into your conversations, how much she's invested. See whether she asks you personal questions, see if she tries to tease you. You can find a lot of short guides on the internet on how text flirting goes, there's a channel on youtube called Based Zeus, look at his videos, they are REALLY helpful.

You need to find your way of flirting, there is no ""default template of flirting"". But first, you HAVE to get your confidence up. A good pointer is to think that she ALREADY likes you, even if she hasn't said it directly.

If you need more help, I'm here for you."
"Damn dude, this was really helpful and totally what I needed, thanks so much! You mind if I ask you a couple more questions?"
Here to help as much as I can. Ask away
"You have given him all the power in this relationship. You've told him that until he tells you he wants to break up, you won't ever break up.
That's great for him, because he knows you won't initiate the break up and he can just leave you hanging around whilst he does what he likes. 

Calm down and think about this. Take some control back into your hands and just tell him it's over. You will love someone else in the future and you will be attracted to other people. Your family don't like this man, they can see he's making you unhappy. 

Ask yourself what you'd say to a family member if they were in this situation, and take your own advice. Hope things soon get better for you."
"Is this your first serious relationship? Because that combined with you having no-one else would make sense.

It might be worth you trying to find some other interests and social groups - find some places to make connections and friends, and take some time for you?"
"Oh for god sake. The number of times you have posted these supposed cries for help. 

Your ‚Äúbf‚Äù has a wife and a child. What did you think was going to happen - you thought he would leave his wife for you? 

You have always just been his play toy on the side and to be honest he is probably bored of you and moving onto his next catch. This is not the kind of guy you should want as a bf - even if you are lonely. 

You are young and attractive - go find a nice single guy to date. "
You‚Äôre 22.  You have so much life ahead of you.  You should get some help and take a break from relationships to work on yourself.  
"Okay I‚Äôm going to be honest to try and help you. It‚Äôs really not healthy to have your bf as your sole social outlet because it‚Äôs inevitable that he will buckle under the weight of the expectations of being everything to you. 

And the stuff you said about him coming in & out of your life is starting to sound manipulative of him. I would just start to accept that it‚Äôs over & do your own thing. I know you don‚Äôt have anyone to turn to but isn‚Äôt there at least someone on your Facebook or Instagram you could hit up to hang out? Or even go on a tinder date. There‚Äôs no proper length of time you have to wait to start dating again & if it gets your mind off him that‚Äôs it‚Äôs a good thing."
"As much as it sucks and as ridiculous as it is, I feel like my level of love for him is absolutely out of this world. Like, he can cheat and lie right in front of me, and I'll make excuses bc I love him and don't wanna lose him. I don't want anyone else.

It may not be healthy, but I'm afraid I'll never love anyone *that much*.. And it scares me. I'm afraid I'll just be alone for ever and compare everyone to him :("
"Yes, it definitely is. My first, and although maybe dumb, I thought it would be the only :(

I'm struggling to take time for myself, because I get lonely and even more depressed. I literally don't know what to do with myself at this point. I'm way too sad :("
Woahhhhhh where did you get this info from? That changes things.
"You will love somebody a whole lot more than this, someday, because you will find someone who actually loves you back and treats you with respect. What you're feeling is natural, but it's an illusion. The thing is, you have to love *yourself* enough not to assume you can never do better than someone who blatantly cheats and plays games. You will find that person someday, and probably sooner than you think. 

For the time being, spend more time with your family members. Any friends you've let slide during this relationship? Well, this might be the time to see if they're still willing to hang out--or just to meet some new friends. You need a lot more support and connection in your life; even the healthiest romance tends to wither when one or both partners insist that it fulfill ALL emotional needs. It's better to have balance. "
"You need to be alone and start loving yourself first, because if you don‚Äôt then you‚Äôll always end up in shitty relationships like this. Because even if you don‚Äôt think you will ever break up with him, he will definitely break up with you at one point or another."
"I'd say spend time with your family and find a social hobby/activity, even if it's online.

Also, consider talking to a Dr. re: mental health if your feeling depressed."
This is not her first post about this. I‚Äôve seen many before. Basically this guy sees her when he feels like cheating on his wife and because she is not very emotionally mature she believes that he loves her and she is super super dependant on this. As soon as a crack in this web of lies shows itself she comes back here complaining about how her ‚Äúbf‚Äù is breaking up with her. 
Holy shit. She must have deleted them because I was looking through her post history. I mean I know she's 22 but Jesus Christ that info makes this 10x worse. 
"Correct. They are deleted. Here is one of the original posts:

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8hshph/comment/dym93l2"
What the fuuuuuuck. This should be higher up. This definitely changes the advice she should be getting. How is she gunna cry he is cheating on her when he was never hers to begin with? She is knowingly fucking another woman's husband. That is low. 
Some people are just hard to live with. If he's known for a temper this just may be him being a asshole. If this is not typical he could have a medical problem. 
"Your Dad has mental issues. Try not to get in the car when he's driving (since it might put you in an accident) and focus on becoming independent. And when you're old enough, get out of the house and live your own life."
"Is this type of behavior new, or has he always been angry and difficult?"
"Hi, 

Sorry to hear this, your dad needs some space. Its important to remember you haven't done anything wrong. You sound like a much better son than me, I owe my dad the world but I always been a deadbeat son did not realize that till recently. Give it a few days, buy a coffee or small things that you dad likes and leave it around his area but don't say anything.

Im not sure what set your dad off, maybe it was you talking about his medication...? I am not too sure. Dads are so important, don't let this one incident ruin your relationship with him. Things will get better. "
"This is basically his everyday mood, mainly because of his health issues. "
"Yeah, my household is generally rough. He also had an abusive father that would beat the shit out of him too. My dad always threatens us and expects us to respect him. But deep down inside, he‚Äôs really caring. "
Thanks for the advice!
The only thing you can do is survive until independence 
"It is not your responsibility to fix your dad being an asshole.

You don't owe him anything.

You didn't 'set him off'.

He has anger management problems and you should concern yourself with taking care of yourself since your father **is mad at a 13 year old** this is totally mental btw, normal adults know that being mad at a child is not productive. 

And it doesn't sound like your mother did anything to help you or tell him to get his shit straight.

Talk to a counselor at school and tell them how your father treats you (screaming at you, saying you have mental problems, texting and driving, etc.) and maybe an actual responsible adult can get you some help."
">I think I also need to add that I feel he's somewhat emotionally unavailable, making me think his romantic interests are somewhere else and not directed to me. He rarely gives me compliments and is not good at making me feel secure in the relationship.

Leave out everything else (which are indeed red flags), and even with just this...why are you with this guy?  Do you really want to spend the rest of your life with someone who doesn't make you feel secure in the relationship?

I've been in these relationships, and let me tell you, it is worth the wait for a guy who makes you feel special and loved and safe on a daily basis.  There is just no reason to waste time on emotionally unavailable guys, especially ones who are still trading selfies with tinder hookups.  Find a guy who shows his love for you consistently."
"I'm of the mind that tinder is a hard red flag during a relationship.

I'm sorry op but I don't have hopeful advice for you. Be prepared, and then bring up the behavior. It might be a breakup conversation by the end of it, hopefully not though."
"Honey, if it quacks like a duck and looks like a duck... then it‚Äôs a fucking duck. 
I think you know what this all means and what you need to do. 
Sorry, I went through this tinder shit twice and I won‚Äôt be made a fool a third time. You should do the same. "
"I think if you are concerned, it is definitely worth bringing it up and hearing his side of it. For me, Liking pictures and things are just part of how social media works, doesn't mean it has something evil behind it. If you are noticing things that you are worried about, definitely ask him, you'll get an answer :)"
"My two cents based on the behavior you posted about and also just a little insight on emotionally unavailable men (I've recently read a few books on the topic):

So, In the past, I've been the ""almost fling"" ""almost GF"" ""kinda talked"" girl who still keeps in touch with a man in a relationship. The MO of the guy usually seems that he's just looking for a self esteem boost. This can engage from friendly convo to slight flirting to saying some things I am SURE the girlfriend would not want him saying. These interactions usually fill out because again, it's obvious he's just looking for a cheap ego boost. 

Now, as innocent as it sounds, I'm pairing that with the fact you said he's unavailable in your relationship...his interaction with these girls is helping him keep that distance. There could be several reasons for this.....he feels insecure in the relationship and looks to them for an ego boost or perhaps by talking to them, he provides a buffer to himself for getting closer to you. Either way, he's unavailable to you...or more so, he's not matching your level of interest and availability. 

It sounds like you are not getting what you want in the relationship. If you haven't talk to him yet, take a day or so with low communication (don't see him if possible) and think of what you want in the relationship. What are things you will not compromise on and what direction would you like the relationship to be heading. Write these things down. After you express your concern about the issues, revisit your list.

Also, perhaps the most important piece of advice....pay attention to how he responds to your concern. Even if he doesn't completely agree or comply. Does he listen, accept his actions without denial (I'm talking just about actions now not how you feel - think verbs and observable behavior), does he at least take time to consider how it makes you feel, and does he take reasonable steps to not hurt you in the future?  

If there's a no to any of these questions, you've probably got to start gathering the strength to leave him, but I know you are strong enough. Hang in there. "
"I wouldn't be cool with that.  If I found out my gf was chatting with guys on the internet I would frankly end the relationship.  

One of my friends had a girlfriend that was real big on having male friends, you know, nothing to worry about they are ""just friends"".  Until, you know, she broke up with him because she was screwing one of her ""friends"" and wanted to date him instead."
"I‚Äôm still friends with someone I had matched with tinder on *3 years ago*. We knew pretty quickly that we wouldn‚Äôt work well together in anything but a platonic friendship and have a nice friendship that I place right with my other long term friends. I personally wouldn‚Äôt find what your boyfriend is doing weird, but maybe you should talk to him or tell us more about how he‚Äôs interacting with them. "
"Start making plans for what you're going to do, where you're going to live, etc because I think this relationship is about done. It sounds like there's a lack of communication and compatibility. You can try to overcome this, but only if he's willing to work with you, and he's already on Tinder talking to women as if you were already gone. "
"My ex-boyfriend used to do this. It drove me crazy. He also wanted me to meet all the girls he was trying to date prior to me (I refused). Most people know this isn't appropriate behavior, but some guys don't recognize this boundary. "
"Honestly, it really doesn't mean he is unfaithful to you. 
HOWEVER it seems to me he is keeping these girls around as backup. This, along with his behavior, signals that he is not that involved in the relationship and he doesn't think it'll last."
He is keeping his options open. I wouldn't call him a boyfriend.
I still chat with men I've met on tinder. Hes a good friend of mine. However only as friends and I dont really send personal pic messages to anyone besides my so. 
"No I would not be chill if it‚Äôs a lot of girls. If it was like one or two my bf met on Tinder and they‚Äôre actually friends, sure, and he‚Äôd probably talk openly about them and say stuff like ‚Äúyou should meet my friend so and so, they‚Äôre great.‚Äù Being friends with many women from a sex hookup app.. uhh no. He just wants a back up, yes. "
"I'm chill with it.  If he and I have a good relationship between us, it doesn't matter to me who else he talks to.  Suspicion and jealousy belong to bad relationships."
"Great insight. So, there are men who do not exhibit this sort of behavior? As sad as it sounds I feel many people like OP and myself stick around because we don't believe there truly is better just over versions of ""meh"""
"He isn't on Tinder know, but is still chatting with girls he matched with before he met me.

You're right I need to bring it up. Thank you for your reply."
Yeah it‚Äôs pretty clear what his intentions are :\ 
"This is what makes me hesitate bringing it up, I wish I would have your view on it and being that chill. I have been cheated on before wich makes my brain look for every possible sign of it. "
ha! why was he wanting you to meet them?
"I think from my perspective, I have never really been ""friends"" with a girl that was not immediately defined in my head as vagina non grata from the get go.  i.e. a male friends girlfriend/wife or someone I was not at all sexually attracted to.

In this situation, you know both parties are physically attracted to eachother and enjoy eachothers company....I don't know why you wouldnt find that worrisome."
"There are lots and lots of men out there who talk about their feelings and make sure their partner knows how important they are to them and how much they care on a daily basis.  My partner doesn't leave a doubt in my mind that he loves me and that our relationship and working together as a team is his top priority.

I have dated emotionally unavailable guys and I know what it is to say ""well he's with me and I met his family so he must see a future with me,"" but dammmmn it does not compare to a guy who tells you regularly how much he loves you and how lucky he is to be with you, who talks openly and excitedly about your future together, who makes you feel included in his decisions and makes you feel like a member of his family and friendship groups.

I promise there are plenty of guys like this and they are worth waiting for."
"To be fair, I have not had many boyfriends, but all of them have been emotionally available and very open with their affection for me. It helps if you're sort of clear from the beginning that you aren't going to waste your time with someone who can't communicate. I know tons of great men like this. "
"Yes they exist! I just married one of them. Please don‚Äôt settle for meh, it‚Äôs never worth it. "
You get what you put up with. If you put up with this...
"I met my boyfriend on Tinder, and for me on this one, it really depends. He's said a couple of the girls he matched with before me were cool to talk to, but he didn't feel any spark or connection with them romantically. For me, without the other issues you've described, I'd feel pretty okay with that I think hypothetically speaking (I'm thankful that he doesn't actually chat with any of them still, because while hypothetically it doesn't bother me, I'd hate to find out that it actually would.)  

However, all of the other things you've mentioned in your post would rope this in as a red flag as well for me. Best of luck."
"No, not really. Just because he's still talking to them doesn't mean he's romantically interested in them.

He deleted Tinder, after all. So it's likely that they didn't think a relationship would work out but they still wanted to stay friends."
"I have also been cheated on before, several times, which is why I am more direct about these things. I can‚Äôt deal with bullshit, if I see something strange I will point it out and ask."
"They were all women he recently tried to date (90% were matches from Tinder, the other women were people he asked on dates from work/etc.) With each of these individuals, there was some reason why they didn't end up in a committed relationship but it was clear that the sexual/romantic tension remained high in these ""friendships."" I think he wanted me to meet them to prove to himself he wasn't doing anything wrong. 

To clarify: I'm all for having friends of the opposite sex. I just think it's uncomfortable for someone to have very flirtatious friendships with former love interests. "
"I don't find it worrisome because I know I am a valuable person, and if my partner doesn't recognize that value, then this relationship is not right for me."
I‚Äôm assuming that person just hasn‚Äôt had this happen to them lol.   
THIS! thank you thank you!!! Gives hope and strength! Glad you put in the work and found someone who treats you with love. 
That's great news! Thank you for sharing your positive experiences :) It's reassuring to know :)
"Texting with guys you used to date is weird to me, which is the overall question of the post. If you‚Äôre cool with your guy having past dates send him selfies then that‚Äôs nice but I wouldn‚Äôt tolerate it, and it‚Äôs indicative of a person‚Äôs intentions if they continue to maintain friendships with people they were sexually pursuing. My past dates and ex boyfriends are constantly hitting me up whether they‚Äôre in a relationship or not so maybe I just have more experience with this."
"""doesn't mean he's romantically interested in them.""

They matched on tinder, its a fact hes at least physically attracted to them.  i.e. I am not friends with single women I am sexually attracted to.  I have a girlfriend, that space is reserved for her.  "
"Yeah but why bother asking about it? If he‚Äôs a cheater he‚Äôs going to lie, and women post here all the time with their stories of finding out their boyfriend cheated, confronting him, and they almost always gaslight and deny until proof is thrown in their faces. Tbh he‚Äôs probably going to get defensive and make her feel even less secure in the relationship. "
"That's great! For me it has the opposite effect: I don't want to blame my boyfriend for something that couls be just in my head due to previous bad expericences. And I don't want him to see me as a problem bringing things like this up... (And yeah, I'm afraid of conflicts)"
"> was clear that the sexual/romantic tension remained high in these ""friendships.""

Perfect explanation for people who don't see an issue with his behavior.  They are attracted to eachother and clearly enjoy eachothers company.  That is a recipe for disaster."
"I'm going to go against the ""omg just dump them"" mentality of this subreddit for a moment, but I think there's a big difference between going on a few dates and being in an active relationship in this context. 

He matched with various girls and went on a few dates with each of them, and for one reason or another, didn't see a relationship with any of them. Obviously he has settled on OP as he's deleted his dating profiles since he started dating her. But maybe he really liked talking to one of the aforementioned girls, and just wanted to keep in contact as friends - what's wrong with that?

Do you not think it's a bit controlling to dictate who your partner can maintain friendships with? Being friends with somebody of the opposite sex does not indicate infidelity. "
"I mean, you do you. But it's very normal to have platonic friends of the opposite sex, regardless of physical attraction.

Furthermore, there's nothing wrong with finding a platonic friend physically attractive either. Just don't cheat and there's no issues there.

Edit: Just saw the comment about you threatening to dump your girlfriend if she meets new male friends. I guess we have completely different attitudes about relationships.

"
"You need to find a way to ask him without accusing him.

The social media stuff seems fine to me, I have exes on stuff, no big deal.

The hiding chat windows seems a bit more suspect though. Don‚Äôt talk yourself out of something but don‚Äôt accuse ‚Äúhey babe, are we good? I just noticed you closing windows quickly lately, what‚Äôs that about?‚Äù Or something."
"I agree there‚Äôs a big difference but when guys text me and like my selfies on Instagram it‚Äôs usually under what men call ‚Äúmaintaining lines‚Äù or whatever. And referring to her post ‚ÄúI think I also need to add that I feel he's somewhat emotionally unavailable, making me think his romantic interests are somewhere else and not directed to me. He rarely gives me compliments and is not good at making me feel secure in the relationship.‚Äù that‚Äôs actually why I left my last relationship, the fact that he gave more attention to his prior female friends and hid chat window screens from me was the first hint. It‚Äôs fine to have female friends, even ones he dated, but texting and liking the selfies of girls he went on dates with doesn‚Äôt instill me with confidence in a relationship where he‚Äôs not very emotionally available otherwise. I don‚Äôt dictate, I just leave. It‚Äôs more complicated for her because they live together, so idk what she should do besides ask bluntly. Maybe it‚Äôs completely innocent~"
">Do you not think it's a bit controlling to dictate who your partner can maintain friendships with? Being friends with somebody of the opposite sex does not indicate infidelity. 

It completely depends.  My gf has a very old male friend. It doesn't bother me at all because I know their history and I've seen how they interact.

It would totally bother me if she started hanging out or talking with some new dude.  It isn't a matter of controlling.  If my SO wanted to form a relationship with some new dude, fine, do what you want, but accept the fact I am going to walk.

I mean OP doesn't know on what basis her bf and any of these women didn't continue dating, maybe the girl wasn't super into it at the time but he was and still is and settled and is now working to get the girl he really wanted?  Its the fact these girls intentions and the bfs intentions are a complete mystery.

The fact of the matter is, I've seen this song and dance too many times and more often than not the suspicion is warranted.

"So your boyfriend definitely has a crush on Abbie. From your post, it seems like you aren't (and don't need to be) worried about cheating. To answer your question, yes - you are worrying too much. The real question you should ask yourself is if this dynamic is okay with you? Personally, his crush seems super annoying.

You're 17 years old - in 1 year you'll have access to a whole new dating pool of adult men. Sorry for being cliche, but why put yourself through the stress of worrying about it? Either concentrate on enjoying the good parts of this relationship, or break it off and save yourself the stress completely."
"Yes. I am sorry to be jerky. I meant to be a kabob. 
I'll be here all week. "
"OMG! Like he really likes her better than me. I thought he loved me. We were gonna attend college and get jobs and raise a family together, but like, OMG. He just keeps making like, googly eyes at her.  OMG!"
"Should I confront him at all about it? I'm in love with him, and he's my only friend... I'm his, too. I'm finding this so stressful, you're right. I'm just kind of at a loss of what to do. Is a crush something to break a relationship up over? :("
"Wow, super productive and respectful.../s. Go be a jerk somewhere else. Don't you remember being young? Shame on you."
"And then like... HELLO?! I'm right here, BOZO! What do you have to look at *HER* for? Ugh. "
"You being each other's only source of community might be a larger issue. It's okay to be introverted and a homebody and I don't mean this to sound like, ""you need to find go find some friends ASAP,"" because that's not the answer. 

  But you should ask yourself if you are really happy not having any other meaningful interaction besides him. Or if you are purposely  ( if subconsciously ) receding from others."
"> Is a crush something to break a relationship up over? :(

That's up to you. Are you happy in the relationship? If he is treats you well and you are happy, then that is what matters. If you aren't happy and can't fix it so you are, it doesn't matter if he ""deserves"" to be broken up with. You can end a relationship that isn't working for you for whatever reason. My personal opinion is that since you say you love him to see if you can work this out but it really dosen't matter what I think. It's not my realtionship. 

>Should I confront him at all about it?

You can, but maybe think about what you hope to get out of the conversation first. Also, don't set him up to lie. Don't ask *if* he has a crush on Abby. Say something like ""I know you have a crush on Abby, and I know nothing would ever happen since she is your brother's girlfriend who is an adult while you're still a teenager. But it makes me feel insecure that you're so obvious about it. I'm not sure if you are aware but you stare at her, you blush and act bashful towards her, and you blush and giggle when you tell me about her."" If your goal is for him to be aware of how he is acting and not rub the crush in your face (since he's probably unaware that's what he's doing) then talk to him. If your goal is just for him to know why you're insecure, then talk to him. If your goal is for it to turn out he has no crush at all or instantly not have it anymore then that's probably not realistic. 

>and he's my only friend... I'm his, too.

That's not good. Whatever happens with your relationship you and him both need more then one friend. It isn't healthy to be so dependent on one person. Additionally, you are in a long distance relationship. So you both have zero in person friends. You guys are missing out on a lot of normal teenage and young adult experiences and just basic social life. Are you also home schooled? Both of you need to make an effort to go out and meet people and to join activities with other people. Join some local clubs, meet ups, and activities for teenagers and or young adults in your area. You won't click with everyone but keep trying. 

It's not good for a relationship to have the pressure of having to meet all of your emotional and social needs. And if you guys ever do break up, for any reason, it will be a million times worse and who will help you through it? Also, if you had friends to spend time with in your area you'd probably be happier (and it would help with whatever difficult time you are having) and less insecure. "
"That's up to you to decide. Every relationship has a ""price of admission"" - meaning some flaw that you have to put up with to date someone. If you're willing to pay his ""price of admission"", by all means keep on dating. Definitely tell him the relationship makes you uncomfortable and ask him to tone down how much he talks about her though. Telling you about the thing where she sat on his bed was a major overshare on his part.

If you have trouble meeting friends in person, try apps like Bumble BFF and Patook when you turn 18. They're great for meeting platonic friends. Or Meetup if you want to meet groups of people with the same interests. It's always good to have friends outside of your relationship in case it doesn't work out."
Of course it isn‚Äôt. Don‚Äôt listen to Reddit; they want to break up over literally anything. People have crushes in relationships. That‚Äôs fine. He‚Äôs not crossing boundaries or anything and you‚Äôre not concerned whatsoever about whether he would. This is a non issue 
"He treats me great. He listens to my problems, sends me a lovely good morning message everyday, tells me he loves me and how beautiful he thinks I am, etc etc. And I really do love him. I guess I'm just disappointed... Like he's not the person I hoped he was, or something. Is it possible you can really love someone but still have a crush on someone else? I feel like he's my one and only. He's the only person I think about, and care about. You're right that I should be meeting new people etc, I guess I'm just antisocial though, or too analytical in social situations, because I don't really enjoy being around other people that much. I'm a pretty intense homebody, but I have a really supportive family. But this situation has made me realised I gotta make some other support systems. Diversify my stocks lol. Spread the load. Because if I broke up with Andrew I'd be absolutely devestated. 

What do you think? I'm i kind of jumping the gun a bit? "
"Well, fundamentally it doesn't matter what I think since I'm not the one who is deciding if I want to be with him. That's why I tired to keep my tone neutral. But based off what you are saying it does not sound to me like you want to break up with him. You say you love him and he adds a lot to your life and you would be devastated if it ended, so that's not reading to me like someone who wants to end things. (And he isn't doing anything wrong/abusive where you would need to get out even if it you didn't want to.) 

I do think it's possible he loves you and has a giant crush on Abby. Obviously, I don't know if he loves you since I don't know him but nothing you've written here precludes that. I can also understand that it painful to watch your SO crush on someone else. That's a completely natural reaction. My advice would be to talk to him with the goal of telling him he is making his crush obvious. You'd like him to be more self-aware so he doesn't continue to accidentally rub his feelings for another girl in your face. You're not angry at him but it's hard for you to watch him stare at her or for him to giggle and blush while telling you stories about another girl. Also, you just wanted him to know that this is part of why you've been feeling insecure. That doesn't make you being insecure his fault but it would help you if he was more thoughtful about how he acts around and when talking about Abby. 

Have you considered some therapy for your social difficulties? "
"Oh yeah, I'm already in therapy. The social thing is just a big stresser, I'm already working on trying to get over it e.g getting a really social job, talking to people more, etc.

I guess it just hurts. I'm not even jealous. I just feel not good enough. It kind of validates the things I tell myself. I don't want to break up, and I won't. I also don't think I'll say anything, either. At least for the time being. Not until I've let it mature in my head a little more and I feel more clear headed about it all. Maybe then I'll just tell him how I feel, not to change him or anything, just so I don't have to deal with this alone. 

Thanks for your replies, I appreciate it :) "
"If anything, as soon as you knew you were going to move in with your BF, you should have told her so she could 1. let go of the expectation that she was going to continue living with you and 2. figure out her next move. That would have been the best way to handle it. After all, you guys had been living together for 3 years, it's not like you were strangers who signed a convenience lease together.

It's possible she's ticked because she felt like letting your BF and all his crap into the apartment was going to keep you favorable to continuing the roommate situation - really I would have told him to get a storage space for all his ""passion"" but if she's going to be mad, she's going to be mad and there's really nothing else to be done. "
"Your roommate can't handle the fact that your life is moving on without her. It sounds like she unreasonably expected you to be her live-in bestie forever. There's probably some amount of jealousy involved that you are moving in with your bf and she's left alone.

There's nothing you can do to manage her emotional state - this is something she has to process and get over. Try not to make it worse by being mad about her being mad (although being so would be justified) and just continue along with your plan. Hopefully she'll find the internal resources to act like a grown-up."
Dropping this on her 2 weeks before lease is up is kinda fucked up.
"I think the only thing you should've done differently was start that conversation earlier. You knew renewal was coming up and waited until you pretty much had to make a decision. It's not great.

There's not a great deal you can do to make things better. She has 1.5 months to find a new roommate and a place. I would apologize for that but make it clear you're not going to be roommates with her after this place."
"Not relationship advice per se, but you need to give whatever required written notice to vacate (per your lease), if you're planning to not renew and move out.  If your lease requires 60 days' notice, you've already missed the window for an August move out date.

And, personally, if I were your roommate, I'd be a little cheesed off at the amount of notice you're giving.  Less than two months on the lease and you haven't even given her a clear picture of what your plans are..."
"There's nothing you can do to make her not angry at you, but you haven't done anything wrong. She's in a bad spot now and directing her anger towards you. It makes sense objectively but I can see how it would make you angry too. 

I lived with a lot of different roommates in my younger years, and the moving out can sometimes create some tension. But if you were friends from the beginning you'll get through this and eventually this will fade into the background and you'll be all good again. 

I think her saying that she's mad is healthy. It's direct, not passive aggressive, and honest. Not a bad thing to have in a friendship even if it feels uncomfortable or makes you feel defensive. I'd just try and be a good friend and be sensitive, personally I'd try and help find someone through mutual friends etc. because she's likely panicking. Maybe if she sees that you are still her friend she'll better understand that this was not a personal decision."
"I think you were very thoughtful in laying out all the choices and discussing this with your roommate. It sounds like she‚Äôs frustrated with the idea of change, which I‚Äôd say is pretty common with introverts. I was once in her place, except my roommate simply told me me that once the lease was up, her boyfriend was staying and I was going. It did a number in our friendship. I‚Äôd say you‚Äôve done all you can, and your roommate needs some time to consider the choices. Remind her that you want to still be friends once you‚Äôre not living together (if that‚Äôs what you want) and offer to have a monthly date with her or something. Ultimately, if the relationship does deteriorate, it will be on her part. You‚Äôve been considerate and thoughtful, but you are in no way obligated to live with her forever. "
"Don‚Äôt take it personally that she‚Äôs feeling mad at you. You are clearly good friends and any big change like this is sure to stir up emotions. What would her living situation be like without you? It‚Äôs not yours to control, but she‚Äôs probably feeling like she needs her current situation and you have the power to change it. The unknown can be scary. 

If I were you, I‚Äôd be upfront with her right now and say that you‚Äôre going to look for places just for you and your bf. You have a lot of good reasons to do that. Don‚Äôt make light of how she‚Äôs feeling and don‚Äôt try to talk her out of it. Do your best to show her that you‚Äôre still her friend. Good luck! "
"My situation is actually very similar to yours - I'm a teacher, I was roommate with a friend that I had known for ten years, and we ended the lease because of professional and health reasons. 
I too felt a lot of tension from my roommate even if she was the one who initiated the conversation about ending our lease. I guess your roommate must be feeling a bit sad about the end of an era, but you shouldn't take it personally and there's nothing else you could do.
You're perfectly right in wanting a place for your boyfriend and yourself, and your present apartment is obviously too small for three people. "
"Reading your comments, older and newer, can you understand her anger better now? Aside from terminating your lease abruptly, I think you were not a very considerate roommate and you should sincerely apologise for that - without qualifiers and without excuses. 

It's really hard, even for direct people, to say things to roommates, because you can't avoid them. You have to live there, and you don't want to feel awkward or hated in your own home. I think a lot of the choices you made were selfish and you didn't take her feelings, or rights as another (original) resident, into account. And now, hopefully, you can learn and grow from this, but your friendship may not survive or stay what it once was."
"Congratulations on your relationship, it sounds like he might just be the one. You are ready for the next phase in your life, with your boyfriend.  

Your friend will get a new housemate, you and your boyfriend need your own place."
"> It's possible she's ticked because she felt like letting your BF and all his crap into the apartment was going to keep you favorable to continuing the roommate situation

That's honestly a good point. I didn't think of that.

I probably should have talked to her earlier, but I didn't even know what I wanted to do until yesterday. That's the main thing I felt bad about: I could have kept her in the loop while I was figuring out what I wanted."
"This is absolutely valid, but having been in the roommate‚Äôs shoes, transparency helped SO much early on. My best friend gave me 5 months notice, and shared her and her boyfriend‚Äôs ‚Äúbig step‚Äù convo with me and it allowed me to be happy for her and not jealous. 6 weeks to find a completely new home or living situation is hard, for financial, mental, and logistical reasons. My advice is to apologize for not realizing you should have shared your potential plans with her sooner (not your plans per se) and to ask how you can help with a roommate search or share apartment hunting resources if you will both be looking for new places.  It could lessen the emotional burden of this whole situation. Its not your responsibility as an adult to do this, but as a friend, thats what I would try to do. "
"Thank you for your perspective. I'm trying to put myself in her shoes, and I know I would be sad if I were her. I actually am sad that we're not gonna live together anymore. But life goes on, you know."
Especially with how long and strenuous the whole renting process can be. I‚Äôve been looking for an apartment that allows larger breed dogs for two months now. The only places that will take them are like 1700+ for a two bedroom. It‚Äôs totally ridiculous.  
"I agree, and I definitely messed up. But we still do have six weeks before the lease ends. We just have to make a decision in two weeks. But I should have discussed this with her sooner."
"I checked on that. They only require 30 days. Honestly up until two weeks ago we both thought our lease lasted until the end of September. Which is why everything feels rushed and we don't know what we're doing. Since I'm the one who wants to change things, I'm trying to give her first dibs on the apartment, but she has to make that decision within the next week or so."
"I'm glad she told me how she felt. We've always been very honest with each other, and that's one of the things I appreciate most about our friendship. I guess I'm just having trouble understanding the anger towards me. I appreciate your insight.

I'm trying to do everything I can to be a friend at this point. I told her if she decides to move out she can take her time, and my mom (who is a real estate agent and found our place for us) would help her find somewhere new to live. I think the hardest thing is processing the hurt of her being mad at me for doing what's best for my life at this point. Your perspective helps. Thank you."
Thank you. It helps to hear from someone who's been in this situation. Your ex-roommate seems like she was kind of a jerk about the situation honestly. I'll give Jess some time and remind her that her friendship is important to me.
"She would either have to move in with another friend (which she's not sure she can do, because he might have another roommate lined up) or live on her own for the first time. Part of the reason I feel so guilty is because she kinda needs to live with me and I don't need to live with her‚ÄîI know it's not my responsibility, but it's like I accidentally signed up to ""save"" her from living with her parents, and now I'm backing out of that.

I told her if she decides to move out she can take her time, and my mom (who is a real estate agent and found our place for us) would help her find somewhere new to live. I can't really help her find a roommate if she wants to stay. But I'm trying to be the best friend I can, which right now involves giving her space, I think. Thank you for your advice."
"Thank you :) I'm pretty sure I'm gonna marry this one, and honestly, I can't wait to start settling into our home together."
"Yeah, I don't think you did anything ""wrong"" - her feelings are her responsibility. Hopefully, she will realize it's just the normal part of change that happens in your 20's and you two can continue being friends."
"This is an excellent point. My BF and I were not sure what we wanted to do, but we had discussed it once or twice with each other, and we should have discussed it with her too. I apologized profusely, and I want to make it as easy as possible for her. I'm giving her first opportunity to claim the apartment if she wants to stay. If she wants to leave, I told her she can take her time moving out, and my mom (who is a real estate agent and found our place for us) would help her find somewhere new to live. I don't know how much help I can be in a roommate search since neither of us has friends in the area, but I did help her math out her finances were she to decide to live alone. I feel so bad for springing this on her, and I just want to make things right in any way I can."
"I can understand why she is mad, although I don‚Äôt agree. 

From her perspective, she is being a good and accommodating friend, while you keep changing things. First, you take over the dining room as an office, which she doesn‚Äôt complain about, then your boyfriend moves in, and she is cool with that too, then all his stuff gets moved in (when it should realistically have been put in storage) and you are using the dining room exclusively for work, and she quietly eats elsewhere. After all the changes you keep making, she is being a good friend to you and accepting them, and now you just want to dump her. In that view, you took advantage and are a bad friend. She is the one that has cause to be upset and move out, but had been cool about everything. You owe her for being so flexible, and are instead leaving her. 

If you want to try to repair your friendship, you can acknowledge that she has gone above and beyond putting up with you, your stuff, your bf, and all his stuff. That while you would have liked to get a bigger place for the three of you, moving every year due to life events would be stressful for everyone, and you want to make choices that will minimize that. Maybe you can have a standing catchup night, just the two of you, once you move, so she doesn‚Äôt lose that part of your interaction, but only offer if you can sincerely commit. She sounds like she is just not very emotionally mature, and you will have to do more of the work to keep the relationship. Unfortunately, it seems like you are destined to grow apart, which just happens as people go through life at different rates. "
Best of luck to you! You‚Äôll have a great time picking out furniture and  making the new place your own :)
Be careful about letting her take her time. You might renew the lease and then have a hard time getting rid of her.
"I can see that. I didn't even imagine something like that happening, because usually we are the ""Hey, could you do your dishes?"" or ""You need to stop leaving your shoes in front of the door"" type. Very direct and non-passive-aggressive. I thought if she had a problem, she would state it directly, because she is excellent at that‚Äîmuch better than I am, in fact. But I can see how it would be hard to speak up about a situation like this where it feels like not much can be done about it."
Also the very nature of living with a couple is that in any sort of a disagreement you‚Äôre automatically 2 vs 1. You might have a straightforward relationship with each other but she doesn‚Äôt automatically have that same relationship with your boyfriend. That can really change established dynamics.
">held off on talking with him about it because this was a cruically important time of his life. When his tests were over, I unloaded all the pent up feelings I had  
>  
>I thought this was shitty to bottle it up and bring it up only when I brought an issue up

And you don't see the double standard there? You both communicate badly. You both seem to bottle things up then unload them, without even a *hint* that there's something you need to discuss, and that's the core issue. Neither of you can know how the other is feeling unless you ask. And yes, it's not entirely fair of him to complain about you bringing something up when he's tired, when you didn't know he was tired. Equally you say ""I decided to talk to him on Friday night"", not ""I'd like to talk to you about \[topic\] at some point, can we find a time that's good for us both?"" Neither one of you gets to dictate when things are or aren't discussed, you just have to work together to find a time that works for both of you. You decided Friday was a good time, but you were wrong.

At the same time him feeling like you're demanding his attention when you're not isn't entirely fair either, but again, that's where floating the topic first plays a part. Stop hiding feelings from each other, but don't also decide that things have to be discussed **right now**. If you've got a concern, say you'd like to discuss it at some point. And he needs to recognise that life doesn't entirely revolve around him being awake/alert either. You've got the right to tell him you want to talk, and he has the right to say ""not now, how about tomorrow/next week/etc."" Tell him he absolutely can say no (for a while) - if he's getting mad just because he can't stand up for himself, that's his problem, not yours."
"I'm like this. I know myself, and so I'll ask my bf to hold off on a major or emotional conversation if I'm already mentally exhausted from work or life. I don't think I'd make him wait days or anything, but I will ask for some hours. If he allows that, he gets a better ""me."" It's on ME to let him know when I can come back to the discussion, so I don't ever say ""later."" That's rude. I give him a specific timeframe, such as after dinner or after I watch a show to unwind. Maybe this could be a compromise for you two?

That being said, your story shows that you tend to make heavy conversations REALLY heavy. It's hard for some types of people to deal with that, especially a year out from the hypothetical issue. I'd rather gnaw my own ankles than drain myself on a hypothetical, maybe, what-if type of discussion. Your feelings and emotions are valid, but maybe you could handle them in a way that meets him halfway? 

"
"Yes, it's actually healthier to postpone serious talks until both parties are rested and at their best, but there's a balance to be had there and it's bit fair to just put off things indefinitely or with a vague ""later"" rather than an agreed upon time. On the other hand, your worry about his residency seems like an anxiety issue rather than an issue that could actually get talked out and resolved. Do you get anxious a lot?"
"I don't know if he's doing it the best way, but I'll sometimes bring up topics with the thought that I want to gauge his thoughts and have a chat.

""Hey, can we talk about the dogs training?""

He'll either respond, yeah what about? OR no, sorry, can we talk about this later? I'm hungry and tired.

That's fine. As long as it comes back to the conversation.

I find journaling helpful when my partner doesn't want to talk immediately. My thoughts are organized better and I can work through some of my anxiety by myself. "
"It's reasonable to an extent, though I think he's pushing it. For example, not bothering him while he's studying is reasonable. Him telling you to wait until next year to have a conversation is not. If he's doing this now, it's not going to stop when he finishes school. The question you have to ask yourself is whether you're comfortable and willing to be with someone who will always prioritize his career and his needs over yours. No one is at fault either way, it's just a question of compatibility. Either you need to decide whether you're comfortable with this, or you need to talk to him and see whether he's willing to work on communication. If you all can't come to the middle, then you need to decide whether this relationship is worth a lifetime of you feeling this way. If it is, OK, if it's not, I hope you find someone you're more compatible with on an emotional level. "
"He wants the benefits of a relationship without doing any of the work. He doesn‚Äôt sound like he should be in a relationship right now. It‚Äôs perfectly valid for him to want to prioritize his education, but it‚Äôs also valid for you to want a boyfriend who pays attention to you. "
"You guys both have valid issues here. He has school to focus on, but you have emotional needs that are not being met. Personally, I feel like a relationship break is best. Otherwise, maybe you guys could have a set time for your relationship? Say, an hour every night where you guys can talk. Make sure when you do talk, you're not just focusing on yourself, and ask him about his life as well"
"I personally think it's healthy to postpone conversations until you're in a mindset where you can communicate effectively.

If the waiting is killing you, ask when we can schedule a discussion so you can get your thoughts on order. Write the thoughts down in the mean time so you don't lose them and can maybe process some of them. 

(There's a chapter on this in The Ethical Slut.)"
"I don't think it's unhealthy to postpone big conversations. A year is pretty long.

Sounds like he just took Step 1 and is started clinical rotations. He is too tired to have an emotional connection right now. With all of the shit he is seeing for the first time he's probably too emotionally overwhlemed to process his own emotions, let alone yours.  Physicians carry an enormous burden for society. No one will blame you for wanting a more emotionally invested relationship. And I don't think you can or should expect that from him right now."
This is actually such a well put comment. Very insightful.
"Thank you, this helped a lot."
"Thanks, I appreciate your perspective and hearing what works for you, sounds like a fair compromise"
Best response yet; I second this advice.  I've implemented this approach between myself and others a lot with great success and much better empathy.
"> I'd rather gnaw my own ankles than drain myself on a hypothetical, maybe, what-if type of discussion. 

This is me, to a ""T"". I have plenty of things to occupy my brain space without adding a whole bunch of contingencies. 

A recent example is me being very pregnant, baby is massive and still breached. I told my husband the details and let him know that there is a chance that I'll need to have a C-section this time around (so he's not surprised if/when it comes down to it), but we won't know one way or another for a few more weeks. He starts trying to throw himself into planning mode as to who can come stay with me after I come home if he can't extend his time off, etc, etc.

I told him that worrying about or focusing our energy on it was not going to change anything and just leave both of us stressed. We can deal with those possibilities when we get there."
"Oh I hadn't thought of journaling, I think that would help a lot!"
"This sounds pretty accurate. The underlying issue is that he'll be a doctor, and where is she gonna find another one of those? I suggest she hang on and put up with whatever behavior she has to if she wants that pot of gold."
"If they're going to take a ""break"" they may as well breakup.  He's in med school.  Things aren't going to get easier for a LOOOOOONG time, and they'll have to adapt to this new means of communication for the foreseeable future to survive his career."
Listen to your gut. Secretive behaviour like this is never a good thing. You‚Äôre not crazy. 
"There are two big red flags here:

* Consoling someone who  is having a difficult time is a known way to slip into infidelity
* Secret communication is always bad.  There is a difference between privacy and secrecy -- your boyfriend is being secretive, why?

When you add that to their previous relationship, it doesn't look good for yours."
"You have every right to be uncomfortable with it. 
If he‚Äôs deleting the messaging and then talking to her on Snapchat where the messages are instantly deleted, then I absolutely think he is up to something.
Besides that, what reason does he have to talk so much with a girl he used to date?
Definitely red flags. "
"They‚Äôre definitely up to something. Absolutely no reason he would be deleting messages and using Snapchat, unless he was cheating. Try snapping her and see what she replies. "
"Let me preface this by saying that you're in no way being insecure. I have a close male friend that I text every day, but never have I found the need to move our texts to SnapChat (where they'll be deleted or can't be retrieved) or hide them from my boyfriend. 

Your boyfriend is definitely behaving suspiciously. And although this may not occur in 100% of cases, offering comfort to someone after a break-up or divorce is an easy way to overstep boundaries into developing a romantic relationship. You've every right to want answers."
"You aren't wrong for feeling this way, it seems like there is a lot he's leaving out about this girl. He seems to downplay it but it seems like they're pretty close. Idk, your instincts may be right, but there is a chance you're just paranoid."
"You are by no means being a ""crazy girlfriend,"" not in the slightest. Those are definitely some red flags that could mean something more is going on here. What that might be exactly, it's hard to say, but if things are truly as innocent as he says, then why bother *switching* to an app that immediately deletes every message as soon as it's read? It's the switching part that stands out to me. If they were previously just texting until you said something, that seems sketchy to me. 

A different state means nothing. My now-boyfriend and I were 800 miles apart when we first started seeing each other. If your intuition is telling you something's wrong, there's a reason. 

>""I don‚Äôt want to seem like the insecure, crazy girlfriend. But at the same time I feel like this is so wrong and it makes me feel really uncomfortable. Maybe I‚Äôm just being paranoid but I‚Äôm tired of just sitting here thinking about what could be going on.""

I would tell him this right here, or something along those lines. Be honest and direct with him in a calm, non-combative manner and see how he reacts. If he's open to discussing things, that's a good start. If he becomes defensive, well, there's another red flag. This all comes down to respect. Does your boyfriend respect you and your feelings enough to acknowledge how uncomfortable this is for you and make an effort to change that? "
The signs are very clear. The fact they've converted to snapchat is even worse. They shouldn't be messaging *every day*. I'm 99% sure he's cheating on you.. my boyfriend is always comfortable with me looking at his phone and never hides it from me. Any girl he's talking to he'll never talk to them *every day*!?
"Ask him about her. ""Bf, I know we've had this discussion before, but I still feel uncomfortable about X. Have you been talking to her lately?""

His answer should be along the lines of ""Yes, I have. I thought that was okay for you. How does this make you uncomfortable and what can I do to avoid that?"" That would be honest and shows he cares about you. If he is annoyed, tries to change the topic or blames you for being jealous and/or controlling... that's a glaring red flag, imo."
"""...her husband made her block my bf.""
Not hard to figure out why that was.

""..and that her ex was controlling. ""

Get ready for him to describe you this way. Afterall this girl is just a friend right up till she's married and her husband has to get her to cut off contact. But of course that's only because the husband is ""controlling"" not because theere's anything else. But lo and behold ‚ÄúWe had a thing but it was nothing serious‚Äù. 

And now he's acting shifty with his phone and using snapchat with her. You really cannot trust this guy. As for her getting a divorce, I wouldn't even believe that without confirmation.

""I don‚Äôt want to seem like the insecure, crazy girlfriend.""Maybe I‚Äôm just being paranoid ""

Don't worry about any of that because without fail he'll start using this against you to cover his behaviour shortly enough if you don't take action."
"Snapchat can be a nightmare for relationships. You have no control over what people send you. You can't prove what was sent to you if confronted. Hell you don't even know if what was sent to you was only sent to you. 

I like to think I trust my GF and am secure in our relationship, but even my head wanders when I see her receive a snap or using the app. 

There is no reason to delete a conversation and then move the conversation to a different platform unless you feel guilty about said conversation and want to avoid any possible slip ups in front of you. 

There's something going on for sure, maybe not yet physical and maybe not even completely emotional yet, but something. No reason to act sketchy if you're not doing anything sketchy.
"
Nope. I'd be feeling suspicious too
"This woman is going to your boyfriend for emotional support, to feel validation, etc. Your boyfriend is still entertaining her because he likes the attention. It is gross that he is going to a woman for the emotional validation that he should be getting from you. Don't ""confront"" him. You don't need a court of law burden of proof. He is lying to you, and deleting his texts shows that he knows what he is doing is wrong. Snapchatting a girl to rekindle a relationship means that he is having an emotional affair right now. Just sit him down and tell him that he's cheating on you already with this girl, even if he hasn't done anything physical with her. Tell him that if he's going to gaslight you and make you think you're crazy for it, then he isn't what you value in a partner, and you need someone that will be 100&#37; honest with you. He is currently going behind your back to message this girl, and lying to you. If he gets defensive or does ANYTHING besides apologize, come 100&#37; clean, and do whatever it takes to rebuild your trust, just break up."
"There is only 1 rule.

If he deletes all old messages, then there is nothing suspicious.

If he has only deleted messages from this girl, then he is chatting on you emotionally and about to cheat on you physically.

Only cheaters delete messages.  "
"He is cheating on you, and lying repeatedly to you.

I‚Äôd just walk. "
"it does seem a bit suspicious if im honest, the fact he's deleted messages and moved to a app like snapchat seems strange, "
I mean looking at what everyone is saying and it being red flags. I would say it's a high risk situation and from that alone I wouldn't want to deal with it. The whole process of betrayal is rather tiring. Just break up with him before he gets better at lying. 
"The fact that he‚Äôs deleted the messages, the fact that he acts weird with his phone, and the fact that your gut isn‚Äôt feeling right about this situation is all you need. Something definitely isn‚Äôt right here. "
"You‚Äôre not wrong to feel this way at all - if you have a gut feeling listen to it. 

Deleted messages are a HUGE giveaway to suspicious behaviour. Snapchat allows for disappearing messages, as in the conversation history isn‚Äôt saved automatically; so again seems very weird for them to be messaging on the platform. 

Ask him about what the messages are and the nature of the relationship they have and be honest that you went through his phone. "
"It really does not look good.  No your not wrong for feeling suspicious because they are being suspicious as fuck. 

At the very least he‚Äôs having an emotional affair.  Find the proof.  "
"Nah this is pretty suspicious. To me if he doesn't tell you something then fair enough, he forgot or in his mind didn't think you needed to know. But when someone intentionally hides something from you (phone angle etc.) Then you have full right to raise an eyebrow. That is damn suspicious and in your situation I would feel very unnerved."
"Almost the same thing just happened to me with my (24f) bf (31m)... and posted about it here for the first time too. The best advice I got (on here) was to calmly bring it up to him. Don't be accusatory or demand answers, just explain what you feel. We too had had this conversation before less casually when I let it go, but saw things again and wanted to bring it back up. I basically told him why it bothered be and how his suspicious actions were what made things strange. He had also been using Snapchat, and sent things to his ex. He assured me it was nothing, but I also felt like I couldn't let it go. After a calm and honest conversation about how it made me feel, he apologized and deleted her contact. You can't force anyone to do anything, just be honest and believe he values your relationship more than any other one. I would also suggest alternatives, and finding a solution where you both are comfortable. Good luck!"
Just let it go it's nothing
"I also thought that her being recently divorced was a red flag. Maybe I just need to confront him about this again. This time, being not as passive about it. "
"I really appreciate your point on the difference between privacy and secrecy, I had never framed it that way, and it's a really important distinction.

And yes, I agree these are both red flags.  ESPECIALLY the secrecy part.  I can imagine a situation where IF they were close friends and IF her husband was actually abusive she would reach out to people she was previously close to.  But your BF's lack of transparency about it, and the fact he's actively working to hide it from you, is really concerning."
"So it's not OK to console a friend?

It's actually a red flag to me of my partner wouldn't console friends if they're going through hardship.

The fact ops bf is sketchy with his phone is suspicious though."
"If you ever catch them mid snapchat, ask to see the snapchat.  If he won't show it to you, it's because he knows there's a risk it could be something inappropriate."
"Like I talk to friends on snapchat. It's not the greatest platform for messaging but it doesn't necessarily mean that it's sinister.

And if it's not sinister, you've just gone through someone else's phone once. That's already a big invasion of privacy."
That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm unsure of what I could even do besides wait and observe some more. But it‚Äôs making me super anxious. 
"I get what you're saying--but it would be stupid to ignore the fact that many affairs start because one person is looking for emotional support after leaving a previous relationship.  It's okay to console a friend, but that can be done without having to hide your phone from your own girlfriend."
">so it's not okay to console a friend?

It is, but it's often used as an excuse while cheating. "
"A friend from his past who just popped up out of the blue whom he was vaguely romantically involved with whose hard time happens to be a divorce. Context matters a lot here, no one‚Äôs making blanket statements about being there for your friends. "
"I think the problem is not consoling a friend, it's doing it secretly. I'm a woman, and if I had a good male friend who was getting divorced, I would absolutely console them. But I would not hide the messaging from my husband, or refuse to message my friend when I was around my husband, or anything like that."
"Depend of how much you involve yourself into it. If it is a weekly check and some contact here and there, it's OK.  It if it is all the time, it's not."
"You wouldn't swap from texting to snap chat though, AND delete all the texts. If it was JUST snap from the beginning, fine, but this is sketchy af."
"No, don't wait to deal with it.  Do not wait for it to spiral out of control. Look at how his communication has escalated through SnapChat.  It's time to have a serious talk about this newfound secrecy. "
Or deleting all the messages...
It never says they weren't just snapping from the start though. OP never saw the phone beforehand and he never messages when OP was around.
She could see that it was a messaging app other than snapchat. There is no reason at all for him to delete the messages and move to snap. 
He deleted their texts. do you do that too with innocent convos with friends? 
"I can't see where it says that.

I still find it a huge invasion of privacy to be going through his phone to begin with because OP is suspicious and jealous. I would be livid if my gf went through my phone without my permission."
OP never saw the screen. There may have never been texts outside of snapchat.
"People get so mad about it but like, really? Yeah if you're not hiding anything it would suck and prove that your gf doesn't trust you, but at the same time if you're giving them a reason to not trust you, it's your own fault. If you've got nothing to hide it shouldn't be a big deal. I'd be upset my bf didn't trust me and talk about that but LIVID? naw, cus I don't hide anything. "
OP specifically said her bf was messaging her and when she went back the messages were gone. 
"Have you straight up asked her if she considers you two still in a relationship? You say you want her ‚Äúback‚Äù but it doesn‚Äôt sound like she wants to be with you and you‚Äôd do better to respect that and stop reaching out. Consider the relationship over. Whatever is going on with her, your current dynamic isn‚Äôt healthy for either of you."
I would be seriously entertaining the unpleasant possibility that she has something going on with this co-worker. 
"Depressed or not, she doesn‚Äôt seem to be putting any effort into the relationship. If she won‚Äôt communicate at all about what‚Äôs going on, I don‚Äôt know how things are supposed to get better. I have bipolar and am no stranger to difficult depressive episodes, but I‚Äôve never been that cold to someone I cared about. A lot of my closest friends have depression or bipolar and have never been that cold to anyone they care about. Of course it‚Äôs different for everyone, but the depression isn‚Äôt going anywhere and if this is how she behaves when she‚Äôs depressed, I can‚Äôt imagine the relationship is going to be very fulfilling for you. In fact, it doesn‚Äôt sound like a relationship at all. What do you get out of the relationship? What do you want in a relationship and are you getting it from her? 

Also just, you should know you don‚Äôt deserve to be treated that way. You seem only to think about her and what she wants and feels, and not at all about what you want and feel. Somebody in the relationship needs to think about your needs too. 

I guess the best advice short of ending the relationship, is to ask her if she still wants to be with you. "
"What Dan did is reprehensible.  You cannot stress that enough to your parents.  That's almost like giving a child a loaded weapon to play with.

You have every right to set that boundary.  If you have a no alcohol role in your home, they need to respect that, and you cannot trust them to do so.  In the future, your husband should always BYONB to any visit and never let that drink out of his sight!"
"I don't have much to say aside from you are *not* being unreasonable and neither is your husband. He's worked hard for his sobriety and it's admirable that he's willing to even socialize with people who were willing to risk his health and your relationship over an alcoholic beverage.

Hold strong. If your mom wants to come visit she can stay in a hotel. If she's not willing, you know where she stands. Trust what that is telling you in your gut."
"After what Dan did you and DH would have been justified in going no contact with them.  Dan's behavior was absolutely *malevolent*.

Your mother is throwing a tantrum because you won't just let this go away.  Stand your ground.  

I seriously wonder if your mother is drinking to excess here, too.  Her thinking certainly seems to be convoluted.

Be very careful.  If you and DH decide to have a family things will get much more complicated very quickly."
You are being completely reasonable. Maybe to reasonable. Dan actively lied and risked your husbands hard won sobriety. If you mother can't see what a violation that is then maybe she shouldn't be welcome at your home at all. Isaac is a saint for even being up for spending time with Dan in any circumstances. 
"Your mother's reaction is completely unreasonable.  Let me tell you a sectet: it's okay for others to be upset.  Let her be angry.  

Your responsibility is to support your husband and his sobriety, not to let your mother walk all you.

Stop taking her calls and returning her messages for a couple weeks.  If they come tto your house unannounced, don't let them iin.  (A somewhat common tactic of such selfish toxic people is to just ignore you, show up, and expect to be offered admittance.  It's a manipulation tactic.  Don't fallfor it.  Don't let her in your house.)"
I am a recovering person. Dan would be dead to me.
"You cannot have a relationship with your parents as long as they think they have full right to basically poison people. 

It was very generous of you to allow them to visit, and even more generous of you to offer to pay for a hotel. If they can't handle that, that's on them. 

You need to stop and think of what the cost is of you being in contact with them. If the cost is endangering your husband's sobriety, that is way too high. 

You do not owe a relationship to people who are trying to hurt your husband. That is incredibly unfair to Isaac. I think that at very least, he should be allowed to never associate with them in any way whatsoever unless he feels like it. 

Have you ever read up on the effects of being an adult child of alcoholics? I think you should do that. Also, have you ever educated yourself on codependency? Codependency is a mindset and set of behaviors that stem from living with an alcoholic or addict. 

Among other things, a codependent person is always trying to save the alcoholic from their own mistakes, and trying to assume responsibility for things that are ultimately out of their control, such as other people's feelings or actions. 

Their emotions around this limit are theirs and theirs alone. If they choose to be angry at your defense of your husband, oh well, tough rats, that's their choice and their problem. You need to enact a consequence. They don't get to visit at all. If they knock on your door, you tell them to go away and if they don't, you call the police. Yes, you call the police on your own parents for trespassing, because they poisoned your husband once. 

You owe them nothing. You need to stop waiting around for them to put their family ahead of alcohol. They are obviously not going to do that. Yes, they could, but they are choosing not to do so. 

That's what hurts. They don't actually love you enough to care if they hurt you or not. They never did. It is sad, but is you are honest with yourself about it, you can mourn and move on. 

As long as you keep acting like a sad little girl who wants a Mommy and Daddy, you will be stuck in your childhood, when you were powerless. You didn't get the parents you deserved. You got these drunks who let you down and hurt you time and again. 

Instead of giving them who do not deserve it all of your love, give that love to the people in your life who deserve it, like your husband. Stick up for him and cut contact with these people as necessary. "
"""We've already made a compromise by letting Dan stay in our lives at all, and we did this in order to maintain a relationship with you. I'm sorry to hear you don't understand the gravity of what he did. We're unable to compromise further, so if a time comes where you're willing to accept that please let us know."""
"You and Isaac are a team. Stop talking about Isaac‚Äôs boundaries. These are you and Isaac‚Äôs boundaries. Don‚Äôt present you and Isaac‚Äôs boundaries to your mom as Isaac‚Äôs boundaries. It throws Isaac under the bus. It also gives your mom a chance to tear down Isaac‚Äôs character while making you a victim of Isaac‚Äôs character. 

Your mom is pissed now, but as she starts to stew, her anger will become more directed at Issac because you‚Äôve been presenting them as Isaac‚Äôs boundaries. 

Keep the boundaries. Present them as you and Isaac‚Äôs boundaries. "
"Let her be angry. Somewhere away from you and she can contact you again once she has processed some of her anger and talk to you at a standard conversational volume. She's probably angry about the fact she is faced with consequences and it's easier to take it out on you than on her SO, the man she sees every day, and on herself.

Give her some time. Back off when her behaviour is not okay. She either behaves like an reasonable adult or it is her that harms the relationship with you. It's okay for her to be angry. It's not okay for her to yell at you. You have to take good care of yourself and your husband. 

Even if they would have done nothing wrong and you're all one big happy family with no problems, it's okay to ask guests to stay at a hotel. Especially when you offer to pay for one. Plenty of people stay at hotels when visiting family."
Did they ever apologize for what they did to your husband?
"I'm eight years sober. Your husband is a saint. I would have fucking verbally reamed your parents and probably destroyed any attempt at you having a relationship with them. Holy christ. This shit is like my nightmare.

honestly i probably could have cooled it if you (hypothetically I'm Isaac) asked me to cool it, but I would not speak to Dan again. I'd just give him the side-eye, and no verbal communication, if ever around him again. What you're asking your husband to endure, being around these treacherous people, is a tall order. What do you get out of it? Does Isaac need to be there, or can you let him off the hook and let him stay home? I wouldn't want to speak to either of them again myself. No reason to. 

I wouldn't want them in my house. You can go out and have dinner if you want, but they wouldn't set foot in my house. Who knows what they could do; leave alcohol around for me to 'find,' spike shit in my fridge, the sky is the limit."
"> we were in a delusional bubble that meant we couldn‚Äôt deal with anyone who wasn‚Äôt perfect.

I find this such an odd statement. Ordinary normal people do not give alcoholic beverages to sober people, in secret, and lie about it when asked. Deliberately giving an alcoholic beverage to a sober person is an *aggressive* action. You're not holding your mother or stepfather to some unreasonable, unachievable standard here.

I think your mother and stepfather have spent a *very* long time convincing themselves that their excessive alcohol consumption is completely normal, and they're going to absolute extremes to prove themselves right (like giving your sober husband alcoholic drinks, lying about it, and then acting like *you're* the unreasonable one for being upset). 

Your mother is demanding an unreasonably high ransom for you to maintain a relationship with her. I think you need to really ask yourself what's the best you can expect from her, and what price you are willing to pay for it. It might be best to go low-contact (or even no contact) for the time being."
What dan did is absolutely disgusting. I would personally never see him again. So mum needs to make a choice 
"I strongly applaud your boundaries and think they are a fantastic way to maintain a relationship with limits. Your mother being so upset is not your fault nor your responsibility to fix. OP, keep supporting your husband!"
"Great. After her phone freak out they don‚Äôt get to visit at all.

You keep setting boundaries and give consequences so they‚Äôll eventually treat you like human beings .... or they won‚Äôt. Just know you don‚Äôt have to deal with shit like this. You control how much they get to see you. If they have a tantrum because you set some very reasonable boundaries after they did something awful, then they don‚Äôt get to see you.

Also no more offers of paying for hotels for them. That‚Äôs too generous after all of the shit they pulled.

Also see /r/justnoMIL "
"You're being completely reasonable, I don't think I'd be able to forgive something like that.

I could understand your mother being upset about staying in a hotel if they couldn't afford it, but you offering to put them up seems like a completely reasonable solution to the situation. "
"I think you have tried to soften this boundary by presenting it as being in response to a specific event and being temporary until you regain trust.

Your parents will not respect this boundary if they see it as temporary. They‚Äôll try different ways of trying to get around it - pleading, anger, ignoring it. Or they‚Äôll just minimise the event that they see as the cause of the boundary. Your mom claims she didn‚Äôt know, your stepdad now claims he didn‚Äôt know your husband was sober.

No more JADE. Do not Justify, Argue, Defend or Explain this decision.

If they want to visit they stay in a hotel. That is it. End of discussion. But whyyyy? Because we want you to. **From now on**. 

If they think it will change at some point they won‚Äôt ‚Äúwork to regain trust‚Äù best case scenario is they‚Äôll just put in the minimum effort until they see things have returned to ‚Äúnormal‚Äù.

You never have to trust them. You never have to forgive them. Treat and present this boundary as a permanent one or they will only ever see it as an obstacle that can be gotten around or over."
"She chooses to be with a man who gave your sober husband alcohol. She knew and said nothing, therefore they BOTH completely betrayed you and your husband. Your mom chooses to stay with him. That's fine, but she needs to accept the consequences of being with this person and the consequences of HER actions as well. Your husband is protecting himself from someone who hurt him, and as his wife you are backing him up. We we we we we, no my husband's rules or he decided. Always ""we"" when you speak to your mom. Visiting you is a PRIVILEDGE not a right. They are not trusted in your home so THEY will pay for a hotel because this is the consequences for thier actions. They ASK if they can visit, they do not just show up when they want. If your mom wants to yell and scream about it remind her she has to earn back you and your husband's trust. If she is gojng to act like a child she doesn't get to visit or speak to you until you both feel ready to do so. She is acting like a toddler and she doesn't like the new rules. Tough shit. She's not allowed to rugsweep what happened and she is not allowed to decide when you can trust her again. Hold firm together OP. Do not let them railroad you. If they show up at your house don't answer the door. Tell them through the door they need to leave. If they refuse, call the police. This is your home, your rules, and your life. They have no say whatsoever. "
I don‚Äôt even know why you want a relationship with an addict who lies and throws tantrums and actively and purposely sabotages a clean addict so her and her shitty addict husband can feel better about their own addiction and are milking themselves and want to drag your husband down with them
">Am I being unreasonable by siding with my husband? Is he being unreasonable by asking they stay in a hotel?

The only unreasonable people are your mom and stepfather.  Do **NOT** give into them.  And do NOT trust anything they give you to eat or drink.  

"
"I am an alcoholic in recovery; my last relapse, while brief, nearly killed me. My relationship with alcohol is such that I need to remember that even one drink could very well lead to my death. There is no middle ground.  You and Isaac are much more understanding than I would be. I would NEVER let someone who thought it was a good idea to let me unknowingly drink alcohol into either my home or my life, family or otherwise. "
"You aren't being unreasonable at all! Lots of people request that family stay in a hotel during visits, just so everyone has a little space. And you have an especially good reason to set that boundary! Your stepfather has shown that he is not trustworthy, and unfortunately, your mom has chosen to side with him. Let her be angry -- you're not being unreasonable, she is."
"Giving an alcoholic a drink is attempted murder.  Your mom should try to understand that.  I understand that the stepfather is an alcoholic and misery loves company.  I am so glad that one drink did not end your husband's life.
"
"Wow!!!! What dan did was horrible, and I think it is very healthy for your husband to have this level of tolerance, and allow them to come at all. You‚Äôre not saying they have to be perfect, you‚Äôre saying that because of dans actions, you guys know that you need to protect yourself around him and he can‚Äôt be trusted. My brother in law says he has a slight allergy to alcohol when people ask ornpressure him. It makes him break out in bad decisions. Lol. I couldn‚Äôt imagine how furious we all would be at someone trying to sneak alcohol he didn‚Äôt want into his body. "
You are completely in the right siding with your husband. What they did to your partner is unforgivable tbh.
"Usually I can at least see the other side of posts in r/relationships, but not this time. You and your husband are being reasonable. In fact, you're being downright generous.

I'm a pretty easygoing guy, but I would've 

**Lost. My. Shit.**

if a parent had done this to my partner."
"This is a hill that I would die on. What a horrible thing to do, and it's ridiculous that your mother can't respect that. My guess is that she doesn't want to have to confront the fact that she married someone who could do something like that and would rather blame you for forcing her to face it than actually do the emotional heavy lifting of reconciling her view of her husband with who he actually is.  


You and your husband are making the right choice for yourselves, and your mom is going to have to decide whether her pride is more important than visiting her daughter or not. Good luck, OP."
"You have every right to be upset at Dan. I don‚Äôt have any solid advice here, but your story just reminded me of a similar incident I experienced in college. 

We were freshman in the dorms and one friend was Muslim, and had told us all that he didn‚Äôt drink alcohol, though he would still hang out and come to parties with us. Another student (Ben), who was eventually kicked out for drinking underage and destroying uni property, gave him a drink and said it was just Coca Cola. Muslim friend smelt the drink, said it seemed ‚Äúoff‚Äù, but was told it wasn‚Äôt alcoholic. Well, it was. I felt so bad for my friend that night and lost all respect for Ben. 

You‚Äôre right to compare that to ‚Äúroofie-ing‚Äù your husband. "
Your husband seems like a saint but if I were him and you still wanted any kind of relationship with people who tried to physically harm me I'd just slowly fall out of love with you until I was strong enough to walk away. May seem harsh but it's the truth. Pick a side and fully commit to it. 
"That's such a shitty thing to do. Wow.. no, she (they) are absolutely in the wrong here."
"Your boundary is appropriate, and in my opinion, lenient.  Alcoholics don't get away with their behavior without the support of codependent enablers.  Boundaries are foreign concepts to codependent enablers, which your mother is in this system.  The longer and harder she rails against your boundaries, the stricter you need to be with it, and you may need to establish even more boundaries.  For me, family member or not, if somebody spoke to me that way on the phone, they could expect me to stop taking their calls unless I put them on speakerphone with my spouse present.  But then, I've been dealing with the alcoholic parent figure for my entire adult life (25 years), and I have experienced how much emotionally healthier I became when I disengaged from the guilt trips and the ""obligations"" imposed upon me to look the other way about the drinking."
"You are completely in there right. You should support your husband in this decision. He is not trying to keep you away from your family, but has been violated and needs time to get over this. He is trying to better himself and dan could have derailed many years of hard work and accomplishment for no reason.This was a huge breach of trust and these boundaries are completely reasonable. "
I wouldn't even offer to pay for their hotel room after an incident like that. Let them throw their fit but you guys are being very reasonable AND accommodating given the circumstances.
"Remind them that if it wasn't for their behavior this boundary wouldn't need to be set. Keep pressing that point. Tell them that they were the ones who decided to do what they did and due to that spectacularly stupid decision they now have to suffer the consequences.

Also tell them they did this and did not show one ounce of remorse or apologize for their actions. Tell them that they do not get to dictate or decide and tell you guys the terms with which they make right their wrongs. Only you, the wronged party, gets to do so. 

If you don't want to go into that much detail just keep reminding her and Dan that all they had to do was not trick your former alcoholic and now sober husband into drinking an alcoholic drink and this wouldn't have happened. Since they made the decision to do that, this is the consequences of their actions."
"I don't even need to read the post. Placing boundaries always makes people angry. Walking all over you worked for her. Now you're telling her to stop. 

If just telling her to act differently had worked, you wouldn't need to set boundaries. Setting boundaries means you react differently, EVEN IF the person is angry, or doesn't understand, or doesn't like it, or doesn't respect it. "
"Have you ever been to Al-Anon? It's for loved ones of alcoholics, both active and recovering. The people there will have experience in supporting sober family members and in coping with those who are still drinking, so I think it's right up your alley.

Fair warning: I expect they'll tell you to cut Dan out of your lives entirely, even if that means you don't see your mom. You don't know what he might do next if he thought this was fun and cool. I don't think it's safe for either of you to be around him."
"That‚Äôs a super hard one to stick to your guns on. I would start off by asking if he‚Äôs that strict on his own family?I‚Äôm also confused. Did your stepdad drug him with this drink(rohypnol, fetynal)? You said it didn‚Äôt taste like alcohol, but after that drink your husband don‚Äôt trust them. Was there something worse in the cup? Otherwise, you are incredible to respect your husband‚Äôs wishes, and the fact that you aren‚Äôt caving in and you are sticking your husbands side speaks volumes about you. He is lucky to have someone like yourself.  "
"I know several alcoholics.

The effort they go through to stay sober is massive.

For someone to fuck with that as a joke. 

Yeah no don‚Äôt let them near anything he might drink.

"
Truly sad and disgusting way for them to act!!! Don't they understand how this affects someone in recovery and how one relapse is all it takes to ruin a great thing? Sounds like a terrible situation for you to be in although great job at setting your boundaries as a united front for the sanctity of your marriage and your husbands well being.
As a recovered alcoholic I would be so livid and devastated if someone did this to me. Even more so if they did it knowing I am sober and do not drink. Your mother and stepfather are extremely lucky that your husband even wants anything to do with them because I'd never talk to that person ever again.
"As a mother myself, your mom's age, I'm so very proud of your husband for setting such a reasonable and clear boundary, and proud of you for fully supporting your husband!"
"Your mom is freaking out because now she‚Äôs not in control. My mom does the same thing about boundaries. She can set a billion but if you set one it‚Äôs ridiculous. 

Stay firm. The roofie example is a good one to pull out if she keeps up about it. ‚ÄúThe answer is no. You deliberately deceived my husband. You broke his sobriety on purpose. This is unacceptable to me. You will not be staying with us. Period. What you did was not being less than perfect. It was pissing on his sobriety and how hard he worked to achieve it.‚Äù"
"I think you were fair to say ""No"", especially since you are compensating by offering to pay for the hotel. Why would she be pissed about a little distance if she doesn't need to pull out her credit card?"
Honestly you'd be justified actually cutting them out of your life for that. Having this boundary is extremely forgiving. I wouldn't budge.
"Your mom sounds entitled. My ex was an alcoholic. Its commendable that your husband is sober. If she can't accept the consequences of Dan's malicious actions then perhaps full NC would be better. It's clear they're both selfish and do not have your happiness, health, and wellbeing in mind."
"Aside from the alcohol incident, no one should ever presume that they have a ""right"" to stay in someone else's house."
"They essentially spiked his drink and drugged him without his knowledge or consent, knowing how high the risk was and how hard he has fought to achieve sobriety. What they have done is unforgivable.

This reads like something straight out of r/JustNoMIL and you need serious boundaries now. They have undermined, disrespected, infantilised and abused you and your husband's trust. You should *never* give them an opportunity to take advantage of you like that again and you need to protect your husband from further abuse. If they can't even respect these most basic and simple requests they shouldn't have any access at all."
Keep your boundary. It's fair.
"Knowing plenty of sober people, I would have actually pushed for banning Dan entirely from interacting with you all ever again if I were Isaac. His allowing Dan to still be around him is a kindness. So no, you're not doing the wrong thing by siding with your husband. Your step-dad sounds like a piece of trash, and your mother is in the way way wrong for defending him. "
I think the lovely people in r/justnomil can give you some good tips on dealing with this
"When you set boundaries, there's always going to be kickback. You have to remain firm. Do not give in under any circumstances and if she starts acting out, grey-rock her and limit contact for a while until she gets it. When she realizes that's the price of admission for seeing you, she'll eventually settle down and accept it (though she might still continue to try to push boundaries in minor ways to see if she can wear you down, so watch out for that)."
"You're in the right, 100%, they need to understand that just because you're their daughter doesn't give them the right to do something like that.

Congrats on your husband's sobriety btw it's a hard journey, and I doubt learning that they basically forced him off the wagon made it any easier."
"I believe the behavior you are seeing is known as an ""extinction burst"".

Basically, someone got away with stuff, now they can't get away with stuff so holy shit tantrum time in hopes that the tantrum will let them get their way.

Your boundary is reasonable, slipping a recovering alcoholic a drink is tantamount to actively trying to ruin their life. 

"
"They knew the rules, they broke them. Now come the consequences. I'm pretty sure they put you through the same rigamarole as a teen, why should this be any different? "
"Fuck no it's not bad that you are siding with your husband. What if your hubs slipped back into alcoholism bc of your step father's decision? I know it's not the same, but I quit cigarettes like 7 months ago, and if someone passed me a J and told me there was no tabacco in it, and there actually was it would be a huge problem for me. I'd have to put in a ridiculous amount of mental effort to fight addictive cravings all over again. Your parents will likely come around, but do not back down. If they choose not to ever speak with you again, just remember you protected your husband and his commitment to fight his addiction."
Your mom got it but Dan got pissed that he's being punished. That's why it took her 20 min to get mad.
"Absofuckinglutely not.

They are lucky you are even agreeing to see them at all.

Send them this post and the responses. If they get it they will profusely apologize.  If they dont just go vlc (very low contact)"
"Being unreasonable siding with your husband? Never! You made vows to HIM, not your mother.  He is your family now and should be your utmost priority!

 That he would even have Dan around him to me is mind boggling. It shows he really loves you and doesn't want you to hurt. But you should LIVID at the person who violated your husband in such a way. As hurt and offended as he is!

I would have told Mom she can visit and leave him at home. If she choses to not see you without him, then it shows her loyalties lie with her man and not you. That is very telling of a relationship.

 Please do always side with your husband. Or his trust in you will be broken and so will the marriage."
"No, you are not being unreasonable. Think of allergy like an allergy for your husband. Would it be okay for Dan to purposely make your husband sick? Never. Dan prioritized feeling smart/superior with your husbands safety. Thats not a little misstep. Its HUGE. 

Your mom is being entirely unreasonable. I mean, even if you did get along, you're not required to host her in your home. Offering her a hotel is even a bit extra polite. "
"You might want to head on over to /r/JUSTNOMIL with this one.

That line from your mom about everyone being perfect was insane. It not imperfect drink making that caused this issue. Dude DELIBERATELY gave your hubs alcohol and then repeatedly assured hubs it was nonalcoholic. Defending that behavior is insane and getting mad about your boundaries is insane. Good for you for having the spine to stand up for husband."
"They known his wishes and your from the beginning. Not only are you compromising with your husband but also offering to pay their hotel is compromising with your parent. I do not see in any way, shape or form where you could be wrong here. "
Let her be mad. Don‚Äôt feel guilty for even a second. 
"Your step father poisoned your husband and she helped him to. That's the legal term.

Tell her that once she will start to respect your husband and you, she can contact you.

"
"Wow, you are being way more reasonable than I would be. They slipped him alcohol. "
"You are being reasonable. That was a huge violation of trust and a deeply disturbing move on Dan's part. You don't need to sweep this under the rug like they want you too. It only condones further questionable behaviour. 

A support group I attend was having a discussion about this exact subject (reactions to boundary setting) yesterday and how our abusers (not saying your parents are abusers) would get mad when we stop cooperating with their bad behaviour. People get mad when you call them out on their shit. People who are used to walking all over people react poorly when all of a sudden you don't let them. They're used to getting their way, no matter the damage it does. It says a lot about them and their priorities. It's really tough dealing with people who are uninterested in self-improvement and reflection. It's even harder when they're family. 

All you can do is take care of you. It's not selfish, it's smart and the foundation to creating healthy, respectful, and balanced relationships. If your mom wants to join the mature party the door is always open but for your own sanity, don't participate in her tantrum. Sometimes you need to let people flail a bit until they get back to their senses. Stay true to yourself. "
Perfectly reasonable. Perhaps *too* reasonable -- I wouldn't allow your stepfather in my house.
They sound toxic.  I'm having issues with my own parents lately and your house your rules.
"Your mom is the unreasonable one for turning hysterical about staying overnight at a hotel (you even offered to pay for it). This further proves that a strong boundary needs to be maintained with her and her bf. 
Her reaction is so insane that might as well cancel her visit and let her know you prefer rescheduling when she has calmed down.

Every time you stick to your ground, she will act less and less entitled because you'll be teaching her you don't reward shitty behaviour. It's incredibly difficult but it will make things better in the long run."
I think you are being unreasonable to your husband by permitting Dan to be anywhere near him.
I get your mom being upset because she doesn't want to lose her daughter and I'm sure she doesn't want to lose her husband either BUT she should be angry with her husband for putting you and your husband in this position. HE jeopardized her relationship with you. Give her a chance to process it and let her make her choice but don't let anyone treat your husband that way and expect him to share his roof with them. 
"Everyone else has most everything covered pretty well-I just want to advise you to be sensitive to Isaac‚Äôs feelings and well being as this issue continues. He may well decide that he doesn‚Äôt want unrepentant poisoners/enablers in his home or anywhere near him-and it‚Äôs vital you respect and support him in that. 

He very clearly loves you a great deal to put himself in harms way to be around these people again-love him enough to know exactly what you‚Äôre asking of him, and when enough is enough. 

ETA: a word and a paragraph break"
"I think it's so wonderful that you are supporting your husband! That may sound like a strange compliment (why wouldn't you support you husband, right?) but there are a lot of issues over at justnomil where spousal support doesn't exist when it comes to these kinds of issues.

You are in the right. Your step dad totally crossed a line! I can't imagine the fucked up demented logic that lead him to do such a thing and then how your mother appears to hasty to excuse it.
  
I think it's far too generous of you to offer to pay for their lodging. Let them pay for it on their own. They are the ones that broke your trust. They need to make efforts to rebuild it and the first step is understanding how bad they messed up. "
"My moms family never really help my dad with his drinking problem. He is now in jail, do to all his bad actions he took after trying the keep clean and falling several times. Everytime he fail he would get into stronger drugs. I am not stay it's going to happen to you but if your husband is asking you for help and your parents did that. That is on them. They are adults, consenques come no matter what age you are. "
"Thanks for the response! We used to let them stay with us with the rule that there was no alcohol in our house (they could drink whenever we were out). 

But even that doesn‚Äôt feel like enough at this point. I think you‚Äôre right that we can‚Äôt trust them. Definitely doing BYONB from here on out, if they even want to see us after this, haha. "
"BYONB?
Bring your own no beer?"
"Yes absolutely, or even more apt: like giving a child an alcoholic drink and lying about it. 

Honestly, it would be reasonable if you and/or your husband decided to cut your stepdad out of your life completely. Your boundaries are extremely reasonable."
">In the future, your husband should always BYONB to any visit and never let that drink out of his sight!


Personally I would not wanna live this way. I would sooner cut these people off if I can't even trust them to not fuck with my drink.
"
Thanks! It helps hearing from others. 
"Ding, ding, ding. Nail on the head. My mother was in the hospital for a cardiac event related to excessive alcohol. 

She‚Äôs mostly sober now, due to these health complications. But they both can‚Äôt seem to understand why we‚Äôre so upset. 

But thanks for responding! I‚Äôll definitely keep standing strong. "
">Your mother is throwing a tantrum because you won't just let this go away.

I think she's also throwing a tantrum because she's having to face the fact that her own husband is an active alcoholic whereas her daughter's husband recovered. And that makes her feel like she's doing something wrong, which she probably never admits. I can see why she's freaking out, not that I think it's justified, but psychologically it makes sense."
He is totally a saint. He‚Äôs the best life partner I could ask for. Thanks for the response! 
"You‚Äôre right. I‚Äôll let her be mad without me around for awhile. I can‚Äôt calm her down, and there‚Äôs no reason to let her beat me up. 

Thanks for the response! "
"Thanks! It definitely took DH multiple therapy sessions to even get to this point, so it completely sucks that they can‚Äôt respect this small boundary. 

He‚Äôs an amazing spouse. 

Also congrats on recovery! Keep up the good work. "
I'm also recovered and same! I would be so livid and devastated. What a disgusting thing for her step father to have done.
"Wow, you aren‚Äôt pulling any punches, haha. I haven‚Äôt read up on effects of being an alcoholic‚Äôs child, but I will. I hadn‚Äôt even thought of that. 

She is totally codependent on him because she lacks the confidence to live on her own now, which makes me really sad. So you‚Äôre completely right about her defending his alcoholic tendencies. 

I‚Äôll definitely give some hard thought to your comments at the end. It isn‚Äôt that I‚Äôm looking for the perfect parenting model (I‚Äôve often played mom to my mom, which is completely wrong). But I don‚Äôt want to completely tether my relationship if it‚Äôs at all salvageable. But if she doesn‚Äôt accept Isaac and I‚Äôs boundaries, I probably have no choice and will have to go through the mourning process you mentioned. I appreciate you bringing it up. Thanks! "
You just explained SO much to me... Wow. Thank you.
"I agree with the first half wholeheartedly, but holy fuck are you drastic, generalizing, and potentially VERY damaging in the second half. 
I‚Äôm the child of a serious meth addict. My self esteem issues stem from me [WRONGLY] thinking that because my father ‚Äúchose‚Äù his addiction over me, that I was worth less than meth and as such he didn‚Äôt want to have a relationship with me. 
I have since grown up, my father is now nearly a decade sober from everything, and we have an okay relationship. We have had many serious talks about his addiction in the past decade and I know that it was not just him trying to make me feel better. For CERTAIN his addiction caused him to fuck up his relationship with two AMAZING children and myself. 
OP, IT IS NOT THAT YOUR PARENTS DID NOT LOVE YOU. Never for a second think that. They do. They were victims to their addiction. And also maybe shitty people, leading to my next point:
Now, everything I‚Äôve said so far was about your childhood NOT drugging your husband. That is where they made that tragic transition from struggling addict to vindictive people. In my experience with my toxic MIL, setting boundaries and sticking to them are the two most important things. Always, always stick to your boundaries because if you don‚Äôt you end up like me with your MIL on your couch in a 1 bedroom apt with no end in sight... 
Stay strong, OP! Feel free to message me if you need to talk. "
"Oh, man. I love this response. I may just read this to her honestly. Thank you so much. "
"Wow, great point. Thank you so much for bringing this up. I am a people pleaser, so I know I could easily fall habit to trying to phrase it as it being Isaac‚Äôs boundary. 

I‚Äôll make sure to stop doing this, and reiterate to Isaac that I‚Äôm completely on his team. "
Good point at the end there! Didn‚Äôt even think about the fact that sometimes that‚Äôs the default anyway. Thanks. 
"He did sort of. He said he was sorry and that he didn‚Äôt know DH was sober. Which is funny, since DH asked if the drink was alcoholic, explaining that he was sober. 

"
"Thanks for the perspective. He is completely amazing to even be as lenient as he is.

My mom is out of state so dinner isn‚Äôt an option. But, maybe me visiting solo for a couple days would be an option. I do want a relationship with my mom (that‚Äôs what I would get). But that isn‚Äôt worth my marriage to such a phenomenal person. No matter what, I do owe it to him (and so much more) to hold firm here. You‚Äôre right. "
"Also, congrats on 8 years! "
"Thanks! I appreciate the perspective. You‚Äôre right - the actions my SD took (along with others in the past) are not something a normal person would do, and she is justifying it in order to maintain her relationship with him. 

I‚Äôm definitely low contact for the next few days, and it might be a permanent thing unless she can cool down and be respectful. "
Thanks! I appreciate the support. 
"Haha, I love r/justnoMIL. Never really thought about the fact that I might like it because it‚Äôs kinda relatable. 

Thanks for the reality check. "
"She can‚Äôt afford it, which is why I offered. I thought it was a nice compromise. Oh, well. "
"I hadn‚Äôt even thought of that. I really appreciate the advice. My SD is an easily angry person, so I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôll see the permanent boundary as an attack, but at this point, that‚Äôs probably not a bad thing anyway. I can‚Äôt worry about his feeling anymore. "
"Haha, thanks for your perspective. Definitely nice to see that this is a big deal. I am considering low to no contact at this point, but it depends on how she handles the next few interactions. "
Thanks! 
"Thanks for sharing that. You‚Äôre right - this could have led to something so much worse, and I am so thankful that it didn‚Äôt. 

I appreciate your perspective. "
"Thanks! That makes a lot of sense. I actually told her that our reason for the request was essential to give everyone space as we process the whole thing. 
"
I agree. It could‚Äôve ended horribly. So thankful it didn‚Äôt. 
"That‚Äôs a good one! I‚Äôll have to tell Isaac it. Thanks. 

"
"Haha, her side was that we always didn‚Äôt like my SD (kind of true), and we are using this as an excuse to not have to deal with him. 

I try to keep reiterating that we‚Äôd spend time with him, as long as they respect our one boundary. 

Oh, and her side is also that we‚Äôre in a liberal bubble that doesn‚Äôt understand people who don‚Äôt hold the same belief system that we have (funny considering one of my best friends is a very conservative republican who challenges me every time we talk politics). 

I‚Äôm having issues agreeing with any of her points. But everyone is entitled to their opinions, I guess. "
"Thanks! I was actually just saying something very similar to Isaac earlier tonight. I think she doesn‚Äôt believe that she can be on her own, and so she won‚Äôt stand up to SD because she doesn‚Äôt want him to leave. 

I‚Äôll keep standing my ground and hoping she comes around. "
"Thanks for sharing your story. It‚Äôs horrible that this has happened to others, as no one should have their choices taken away from them. "
"I appreciate you being so honest. 

DH and I have both been through a lot of therapy, so we‚Äôre both pretty good communicators with each other. I trust him that if he was facing a situation where he was falling out of love with me, that he‚Äôd bring it up so we could address it. 

If this did cause this to start happening, I would for sure choose his side. He means the world to me. At this point, I‚Äôm considering low to no contact with my mom anyway, as she shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to berate me for having such a small request. "
Thanks!
Thanks for the response! I hadn‚Äôt thought about the fact that in a way I‚Äôm also enabling him  if I‚Äôm lenient with her. That‚Äôs a wake up call. 
Thanks!
"Thanks! I‚Äôll keep trying to be clear about what led to these actions. She currently keeps saying that we never liked him, and that‚Äôs why we‚Äôre doing this. 

We‚Äôve never cared for him, but we used to be okay to him staying with us, as we care for my mom and would put up with it for her. But yeah, basically drugging my husband kind of means we can‚Äôt offer you that anymore. "
Thanks! I‚Äôll take a look. And thanks for the warning; it might be good to get some strong opinions though. Everyone here is already making me realize that my original boundaries were pretty generous. 
"Thanks for the response. No one in DH‚Äôs direct family would do this, but I imagine he‚Äôd be even stricter if someone on his side did do this. He only accepted SD back at all because I wanted a relationship. 

It was a very mixed fruity drink, so I imagine the alcohol was a bit masked. There were no drug, drugs in it, but alcohol itself in this case could be considered a drug. Either way, when someone flat out asks you if this drink has alcohol in it, lying to their face is a pretty crappy thing to do. "
Thanks! I appreciate the input. 
"Thanks!  My husband and I have been pretty in tune today and it‚Äôs definitely made our relationship stronger. Silver lining, I guess. "
Thanks! I appreciate your view. And congrats on recovery. Good luck in the future!
"So happy to hear from a mom! My heart hurts causing my own mother pain, but it is what it is. Thanks for responding! "
"I brought up the roofie example to her during the slightly civil conversation we had before she blew up. It didn‚Äôt help unfortunately. 

But you are totally right. It was pissing on his sobriety and that‚Äôs unacceptable. "
"Probably because when she had said it was just her, we were okay with her staying with me. But once my step dad was also coming, we were not okay with them being in the same house with us. 

She didn‚Äôt want to explain to my SD why we changed the plans, so she just got mad. That‚Äôs only my theory, but yeah. "
I‚Äôm realizing this more and more. Thanks for mentioning it as well!
"Thanks! So many people are saying this, and it‚Äôs really giving me a reality check. Isaac is amazing for letting them back into our lives at all, and I won‚Äôt betray him by not upholding that boundary. "
"Thanks! Yeah he struggled for a bit with it - mainly because he was so angry (rightly so), and was trying to figure out how to process that anger. 

He really is something else though. I‚Äôm so amazed at his resolve and emotional intelligence. "
Thanks for sharing that! And congrats on being smoke free - that‚Äôs so hard to do. 
"He was at work while this all went down, so I‚Äôm not too sure that was it. 

My mom often has this pattern where she‚Äôll sit and stew, and then blow up. I also think she was civil in the first conversation because I mentioned that I appreciated that we could talk like adults, even though we were both uncomfortable. That held the blow up off for all of 20 minutes, haha. "
"Have been SO tempted to send her this post, but I know that‚Äôd make the situation worse, haha. Thanks for the support. "
"Thank you! This is so important to hear. You‚Äôre right. I made him a commitment, and I plan on protecting him as I said I would. Especially because he is so amazing to me in every way. "
Thanks for the response! 
"Haha, thanks! I might go over an share this with r/justnoMIL, since so many people have suggested it. 

Never thought I‚Äôd be posting there. "
Thanks! Good luck with your parents. 
Thanks for your opinion! 
"Thanks! You‚Äôre right. My husband becomes above everything. 

She stands up for my SD and won‚Äôt leave him because she thinks she needs him financially and emotionally. She keeps saying at her age, she won‚Äôt meet anyone else. I think that‚Äôs the main reason she‚Äôs upset that I‚Äôm causing tension - she doesn‚Äôt want to stand up to him. "
"Thanks! He does love me, and I‚Äôm so appreciative. He‚Äôs really something, and I‚Äôll work hard to make sure I show him all the love he deserves back. "
"Thank you so much for the compliment. I feel like I could be doing even more.

I offered to pay mainly because I knew she couldn‚Äôt afford it. So me paying would be the only way for her to come in this scenario. But yeah, her blowing up definitely isn‚Äôt making us get any closer to trusting them. And the fact that they can‚Äôt even empathize is really upsetting. "
"Thanks for sharing. I don‚Äôt even want to imagine what could have happened to my husband if this made him slip. I appreciate that everyone is bringing that up, and I‚Äôll work to protect him from here on out. "
"Honestly, I think they're lucky that you're even still talking to them after pulling a reprehensible stunt like that."
"> Definitely doing BYONB from here on out, if they even want to see us after this, haha. 

Who cares what *they* want, they're the ones in the wrong. At this point they should be ashamed and grovelling for forgiveness."
Right now I think you are right to prioritize your husband‚Äôs sobriety. He needs to know he can count on you.
"Bring your own non-booze was what I was saying in my head, haha. "
Bring Your Own Non-alcoholic Beverage
Or bring your own non-booze!
"If your mother is angry, **it means that the boundary is effective.**

It takes time to adjust to the boundary.  Your mother will never like it, but she will (mostly) stop whining about it once you get through the initial difficulty of *defending* the boundary.

It sounds awful, but you can train people pretty much like you can train dogs.  You are essentially training your mother to stay off the furniture and she doesn't like that:  the furniture is nice!  It's comfy!  Why are you being so mean?

Remember:  **YOU have all the power here.**  You have the power of *your presence:*  she wants it and she can only get it on your sayso.  "
"Good. Never capitulate to terrorists. 

I wonder if your mother thinks the health scare should be enough to soften your stance and is mad she's not getting her way. After all, she can hardly drink at all. 

But really, they lied to get your husband to drink, and they attacked when you enforced the boundaries their lies erected. It would probably be a good idea to cancel this visit entirely and try again later in the year. "
"They know why. 

This wasn't an accident. There's no way they can claim they forgot and now don't get why you're making a big deal. They deliberately have your husband a drug without his knowledge and with whatever the opposite of his express permission is. Has your mum apologised for not coming clean? 
"
"Thing is, she doesn't have to understand it, she just has to accept it. If she can't accept a perfectly straightforward rule about *your* house and *your* life, whether she agrees with it or not, it's because she wants to control / rug sweep / deny / minimise the situation, rather than actually move forward constructively and maintain your relationship. "
"34 years, and still going strong.  Thanks, and tell your husband, that wasn't a violation of a boundary, that was a deliberate attempt to get him back to drinking. Sabotage is what some people do as way to excuse the own inability to get honest.  "
"I was on a cruise once, and I was in club with my wife. I ordered a club soda a cranberry juice, and she ordered a ""drink"" drink. I normally have her sip mine when were out, just in case. This time I didn't. 31 years sober, and I recognized the taste instantly. I spit it back in to the cup. 

The wise guys in my home group gave me a 90 day coin three months later...."
"Yeah, of course it‚Äôs your choice, but I feel like Dan basically *did* roofie Isaac.  He would be dead to me too. Your mother should be groveling at your feet, not bristling at you having boundaries. "
"What u/floomby is describing is something called complex trauma. It's basically a form of PTSD that comes from growing up in an abusive environment (whether that's physical, sexual, or emotional). In cases of emotional abuse, the triggers are relational, i.e. fears of rejection or abandonment rather than fear of being physically harmed. But of course you don't know that you're flipping out about rejection or abandonment in the moment you're triggered, it's disguising itself as whatever the situation is that triggered it (i.e. a conflict with someone you care about regarding something unrelated). Also tagging u/twocupsoffuckallcops because learning about complex trauma changed my life, and it sounds like you're ready for that journey too. :)"
"I recommend Melody Beattie's book Codependent No More, and the workbook that goes with it for you. I'm currently using both with my therapist, and it's been a wonderful tool."
"TBH I would consider Dan drugging your husband to be assault. He secretly gave your husband a substance he knew would hurt him. You don't come back from that, ever. And Dan and Lynne aren't even trying to."
"Just want to emphasize that your husband would definitely be justified in never wanting to see Dan again, ever. You‚Äôre doing your mother a massive favor by even allowing Dan to be in your vicinity and she needs to appreciate that. "
Yay! I like feeling useful!
">I am a people pleaser,

Please think about getting yourself some therapy because you're an adult child of alcoholic(s).  It's OK to have boundaries and if someone gets mad at you, that's OK.  It would be helpful to reset your normal meter and firm up your spine before having kids.  

Good luck and I hope your husband continues to maintain his sobriety.  "
He did it on purpose. Like those people who give nuts to people with allergies and then come over all ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt think it was real/that serious/some other bullshit‚Äù when the person needs a hospital trip or whatever 
So he's still lying about it. It doesn't seem like he's very remorseful if he can't even fully admit what he did and take responsibility for it. 
"Stop dancing around telling about the issues. I know you know what happened but the way you verbalize it is lacking and really enabling. ""Which is funny"", ""he did sort of"" etc is not cutting it. What happened is "" He did not apologize for his actions. He attempted to lie and shrugs off his responsibility in what happened. Dan said he didn't know my husband was sober but I know that was blatantly untrue as my husband said it several times while asking if the beverage was alcoholic after getting it. Dan knowingly drugged my husband."""
"I think a compromise here would be to never allow your parents into you and Isaac's home again. A home is a safe space- Isaac should be able to know, in his own house, that there is no alcohol and no temptations that he doesn't know about. 

You can visit them out of state, you can have dinner if she flies in to visit, but poisoning your husband AND THEN NEVER GENUINELY APOLIGIZING ABOUT IT is grounds to be severed completely from both of your lives. It is because of your husband's strength of convictions that you aren't living with an active alcoholic right now. One drink can definitely do that to people. 

"
Your mom basically drugged your husband for no reason... r/justnomil is your people.
"Honestly it would be the same with my mom . Not only do we not have the space (we don't even have a couch right now lol), we can't stand her smoking.  But she'd want to stay with us instead of either of us spending hotel money, even though I'd see it as me doing something nice for her.

But anything I do that my mom doesn't %100 agree with turns into so kind of fight, so I definitely feel your frustrations"
I am sure he will see a permanent boundary as an attack but a temporary boundary would be an attack too - and one he‚Äôd think he could fight back against.
"No. This thinking is bullshit. No surprise, it's a favorite tactic used by toxic nutjobs to guilt you into doing whatever they want. ""Two sides to every story! Everyone deserves their opinion!""

Some opinions are egregiously, factually incorrect. We shouldn't tolerate that, we should shut it down.

Your mom and dad literally believe that Isaac's sobriety exists on the same level as unicorns and that Dan has the right to assault your husband, and you guys have to tolerate it. This is **bullshit.** It's hurtful, factually incorrect, unethical, and probably constitutes assault in the legal system. 

There are no two sides to the story. Dan and Lynne are wrong and you don't have to tolerate it."
"Ah, I see. She doesn't want to have to explain to him or hurt his feelers. Oh well, tough shit. It's your home. "
Of course! You're being a good partner for staying in his corner.  And thank you üòä it's been a rough ride up to this point hahaha 
Oh man. Still. Sucks all around but stand your ground.
No it wont (make it worse)-its already awful.
Thanks. Good luck with your situation as well.  But it's your house and your rules.  Sometimes it better to cut ties.  Giving a sober person alcohol is beyond vindictive and honestly I'd have ended contact at that point.
"She can't expect you to understand her defending her husband who absolutely violated your husband's trust, and not understand you defending yours who did nothing wrong. In a previous marriage, my brother in-law very aggressively tried to come on to me. He was 20 years older and married. My husband tried to guilt me into staying under the same roof with him when his family visited and I never forgave him. You are doing the right thing to help ensure for your husband there's no chance of it happening again. "
Alcoholism is something people dont like talking about but we need to expose how serious things could get because we are only humans. We create mistakes. Family is important but your husband became your family when you got married. Him and your children should be your priorities. Parents will understand if you talk to them. They get mad when things dont go their way but they need to understand you have responsibilities as a wife and mother. I personally lost my family at the age of 15 do to alcohol. Hurts getting married without a father by your side because he resided alcohol was his priority. 
Exactly. Technically they drugged him. Why? Did they think it was funny? Dan is a drunk and can‚Äôt stand to see someone else get sober and has to undermine him? They would be long gone from my life. 
I love that analogy. Too funny. Thanks! 
"Yeah, I‚Äôm definitely going to give her time to calm down, and if that means we wait to see each other, so be it. 

Her health scare did the opposite than soften me, haha. She might be hoping it will, but it just made me want them to stop drinking so much more. Plus, SD at that time said he‚Äôd check into a rehab program, admitting his drinking was out of control. Surprise, he never did. Didn‚Äôt help with Isaac and I‚Äôs distrust. "
"If anything, it should make the mother empathize with OP more. What if someone tried to slip mom a drink and she ended up back in the hospital? She should be a lot more understanding about the seriousness of what Dan did. The fact that she's not is an excellent example of why OP needs boundaries."
"She actually has not apologized at all. She was unconscious when my SD brought it up, so she didn‚Äôt get to comment until the drama had already started. 

But you‚Äôre right. They did drug him. Thanks for the response. "
"Thanks! I think you‚Äôre right. She just wants to minimize everything until it goes away, because then she won‚Äôt have to deal with the situation and the fact that SD will take offense to our boundary. "
Thanks! I‚Äôll tell him. I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôd agree and appreciate that there are others who get it. 
"Good job!! And plus you were on vacation? That was incredible strength, friend!"
"That's bs. You didn't even drink it, why would they make you start from the beginning? Wasn't your fault."
"That's what I love about the program, everyone's so respectful and serious-minded :)"
"Also going to do some digging on this. I never really considered that I also might be the one worried about rejection / abandonment. 

My mom for sure is afraid of abandonment by my SD , which is why she‚Äôs defending him so violently. But maybe some of my leniency and hesitancy is coming from the same place. 

Thanks!"
Thanks for the suggestion! 
"Thanks! I think you‚Äôre right, and I‚Äôm happy that everyone here has made me realize that. "
"Thanks! I did a lot of therapy a few years back (I had an eating disorder and managed to get help!), so I‚Äôm not unfamiliar. I was thinking today of going back just to check in and talk through all of this. 

Thanks for the well wishes. I appreciate it! "
"Someone linked a justnoMIL post here a while ago where the grandma, fully aware of the kid‚Äôs very specific allergy gave her that allergen anyway. Kid died, was one of 2 twins and an older sibling just old enough to remember. It was horrible."
"I think you‚Äôre right. I think he thought it was funny, and that DH might magically want to drink with him if he showed him alcohol was no biggie. 

It‚Äôs a humorous thing coming from an alcoholic. "
"Totally agreed. I tried to politely bring this up to my mom, but she just kept saying he didn‚Äôt know. I don‚Äôt think she can let herself admit the whole truth, because she‚Äôs not willing to realize she‚Äôs married to a butthole. "
"Thanks for your opinion. My language is my own. I‚Äôm generally a happy person and do try to find humor even in the darkest situations. 

I appreciate you mentioning that it comes off as dancing around the issue. I don‚Äôt mean it to, and I‚Äôll try to keep that in mind in the future. But I‚Äôm unwilling to change my optimistic sense of humor just to make the Internet think I‚Äôm more serious. "
"Thanks! I‚Äôll also consider this as an option. I think us visiting them is a bit safer anyway, as we have more control over if we want to take ourselves out of the situation. 

I appreciate the feedback. "
"Same. I often have to tread around saying certain things to my mom, because it‚Äôll set her off. She means well, she just isn‚Äôt ever willing to hear my side of things. 

Good luck to you! "
Completely agree. Thanks! 
"Thank you so much for this! I‚Äôve been mulling over the two sides to every story thing since this happened and wondering if her POV had any merit. Hearing that sometimes people‚Äôs opinion can just be flat wrong really helps. 

I don‚Äôt know that she‚Äôll ever come around, but I appreciate that everyone is so supportive and is helping me realize that she‚Äôs the one being ridiculous.  "
"Love that. Wish I had the guts to say ‚Äútough shit, it‚Äôs my house‚Äù to her face. Maybe I‚Äôll get there one day. "
Thanks! Will do. 
"Oh, wow. Thanks for sharing that. I am so sorry that your ex didn‚Äôt defend you. I‚Äôm happy I didn‚Äôt make the same mistake, and I‚Äôll make sure to continue defending DH. 

"
"I‚Äôm so sorry for your loss. Thank you for sharing.

I completely agree that we need to be more open as a society about alcoholism (and mental health in general). The more I think about this situation, the more I feel that I‚Äôm not doing more, as I (and my brothers) stand by and watch my SD drink himself to death. It just sucks because so often alcoholics also don‚Äôt listen when you try to help. "
"They didn't just drug him, they deliberately attempted to damage his entire life. They tried to damage his health, his work, his marraige. This isn't like just giving someone a roofie, this is like giving someone an allergen. 

It doesn't really matter whether he did it because it would be funny, or because he didn't think it was a big deal, or because he was actively trying to destroy your husband. 

And now they're upset you're holding them accountable? Yeah... good boundary. Don't back down. "
"I'd tell her, these are the terms for you visiting. Take it or leave it, it's not a discussion."
The fact that they didn‚Äôt even apologise for Dan‚Äôs appalling violation of your husband has me wondering why they are still even in your lives...
Then you absolutely cannot back down. Your mother is actively looking to harm your husband so she can excuse her own alcoholism in her mind. You can't let someone this toxic around you and your family. So either you need to stop seeing her or she needs to be less toxic. Either way it starts with setting boundaries and keeping to it which you're doing a great job on - keep at it!
"So wait... you just set a boundary with your mother without EXPLAINING why you set the boundary?  Your mother didn't know about this and you hit her with the CONSEQUENCE before you gave her a chance to understand the REASON?  No wonder she flipped.  From her perspective it probably seemed completely out of left field if she didn't know WHY you were suddenly doing this.  

I agree with the boundary setting and drawing a line, but the people you are doing it to have to know what the cause --> effect is.  Your mother didn't drug your husband, her husband did.  She should have been told first. "
Her reaction was the reaction of someone who *knows* how badly they fucked up. ‚ÄúSorry I‚Äôm not perfect‚Äù is the favorite non-apology of people who want to make their accuser feel unreasonable for calling out a serious transgression. 
"We were on vacation. On a Disney Cruise! I have been sober long enough to be pissed, and still know, I didn't drink. I was so pissed, I went to guest services, told them exactly what happened, and exactly why I was upset. I know it wasn't intentional, unlike in the case of the OP on this thread, but I was upset.

They comp'd us on a bunch of things, and we made the best of it."
Im pretty sure they did it just as a joke.
"They didn't. They were busting my nuts to be wise guys, and to remind me that life happens, and we take it one day at a time. It isn't like I took a sip, spit it out, and ran down to the duty free store to buy a bottle of Jack! They were actually teasing me because I felt the need to share it. "
"My sponsor mentioned that I had taken in more alcohol eating tomato sauce in Italian restaurants , than I had in the mouthful I spit out!"
"Anytime! To be clear, I was just using rejection/abandonment as examples but they are among the biggest players on the complex trauma field so definitely worth looking into. With addiction we also see a lot of parentification which is a kind of role reversal between the parents and kids where the kids end up taking on levels of responsibility that are developmentally inappropriate. Being ""responsible"" for managing a parent's moods would fall under this, as would cleaning up the bottles, putting the parent to bed when the pass out, etc. Adults who grew up in these conditions often have trouble with boundaries and self-care. They have a tendency drive themselves into the ground by putting others first at their own expense because they feel guilty prioritizing their own needs. Even in extreme circumstances, because those extreme circumstances are normalized."
"I also recommend the book ""The Narcissistic Family"", it is amazing. A lot of it is relevant to children of alcoholics."
"Thank you for taking all these comments into consideration without feeling attacked or playing a victim. I just wanted to say that, since a lot of people already addressed your situation very well. 

It may be easier for you to look into the situation this way - if your om doesn't behave, put her first on a time-out, then that time-out can always get longer if she keeps on with her behavior."
Was that the one about using coconut oil to brush the hair?
My god people are awful
"That's just it. He doesn't want to admit he himself is an alcoholic so he believes that it isn't a big deal, and probably thinks Isaac is trying to be better than him"
She knows the truth. And she knows she‚Äôs married to a butthole. Hence her vehement defensiveness. 
Why are you being so polite to her about her spouse drugging your husband? Why are you still trying to please her when she is so clearly at fault?
"> She means well

In all seriousness: how do you know?"
"Yeah, you will. Eventually. Baby steps. "
"Thanks! I get that. I‚Äôm so appreciate that everyone has brought up the fact that this could have turned into something so much bigger. It makes me so thankful that things didn‚Äôt go that way. 

It also forms me in my belief that I need to keep this boundary. I owe it to my husband to keep him safe. 

Edit: took out an accidental plural. "
"She knew why, because we had explained to her previously why we were no longer staying in her house when visiting during her hospital stay. 

I think I told her something along the lines of, ‚ÄúIsaac and I still want to spend time with you guys, but because of SD‚Äôs actions we don‚Äôt feel comfortable sleeping in the same house. We‚Äôd like to maintain a bit of distance to allow us to process.‚Äù 

I reiterated that yesterday, while trying to give her the roofie comparison so she‚Äôd understand a bit more about how Isaac felt violated when the alcohol incident happened. 

But I do think you‚Äôre right that this came out of left field for her. And I think I should‚Äôve been more clear from the beginning about this boundary, instead of bringing it up only when they wanted to visit. But she does know why the boundary is there. Thanks for bringing this up. "
"Heh, no joke. I know alcohol doesn't actually cook out all the way unless you simmer it for hours and hours, but it's the taste I'm worried about more than the trace amounts of chemical. So no vodka penne for me, but I'm not sweating the red wine in the marinara."
I‚Äôll check it out! Thanks. 
"Love the idea of considering it a time out. So much of this is about wrapping me head around distancing myself from my mom (which is hard for me to consider). Thinking of it as a time out actually helps a lot. 

Thanks!"
Yes. I get so sad every time I see the post (it‚Äôs always the first post when someone links the justnoMIL subreddit)
"You get nowhere in trying to communicate when you just yell. I appreciate that you think my language or tone isn‚Äôt strong enough, but if I wasn‚Äôt at least pleasant, she wouldn‚Äôt listen to me period. 

While I may decide that eventually it isn‚Äôt worth it to repair this relationship (which may make my tone change), at this moment I‚Äôd prefer to at least try to civilly communicate. "
"Because she raised me. I saw firsthand she‚Äôs a caring person. 

She just had bad parents that she modeled herself after, and that‚Äôs not okay. But I know she isn‚Äôt being malicious. "
">  I owe it to my husband to keep him safe.

Please do!

I have allergies, thankfully not the swelling, and my Dad ""tested"" my allergy, once.

Learn from my mistake. :/"
I‚Äôm almost 7 years sober and if someone did this to me I would be devastated and they would be dead to me. It‚Äôs such s violation. 
"Ah okay, totally different then.  I thought the drama you referred to starting was when you told her she couldn't stay at your house.  The way you said she was unconscious and didn't know until the fit hit the shan, Ithought she basically woke up, life carried on and then she asked to come stay and you were like, ""Nope, you're banned from my house"".

But anyway, yeah definitely keep the boundary.   And I really want to know ... did she KNOW her husband had drugged him before this, or did she actually think the drink WAS non-alcoholic, 

Because that would be a dealbreaker.  I mean if she didn't know the drink was drugged, even if she said it wasn't because she just assumed her husband wouldn't be a shithead enough to drug your husband, that's one thing.  If she knew at the time the drink had alcohol in it and lied and said it was fine...

Well, I'd be drawing a way firmer boundary than your husband was drawing. 

"
"It never really cooks out. I won't eat anything that has the name of a booze in it's name.

I use mouth wash, and I take cold medicine. If I go out, it won't be to drink Listerine. "
"If we are going to reccomend books, I can recommend ""Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents"" by Lindsay Gibson. It is a book with a mild tone, maybe too mild for you as you are dealing with alcoholics as parents and thus there's clearly something wrong, but substance abuse does make parents emotionally unavailable.

It's also a short book, so it may not overwhelm you, if you have a long reading list. It focusses on what you can do for yourself now as an adult."
That one sure is stuck in my memory. I can't imagine how the family is doing.
"If it makes you feel any better it is likely fake. Find me literally one documented case of anaphylaxis from coconut oil and I will reconsider my position. On top of coconut allergies being nearly impossibly rare, refined oils do not carry the protiens people are allergic to."
"> Because she raised me. I saw first hand she‚Äôs a caring person. She just had bad parents that she modeled herself after, and that‚Äôs not okay. But I know she isn‚Äôt being malicious. 

This thought is a giant red flag so I‚Äôm going to say something that will be hard to hear. I‚Äôm saying it because I recently realized that my parents can still hurt me despite me believing they are ‚Äúnot being malicious‚Äù: **Someone who cares for you and loves you in a way that is not toxic or unhealthy for you could NEVER be able to hurt you and love you at the same time. Causing you pain for any reason would cause them pain too because they love you.**

That your own mother had bad parents is a REASON why she is a bad parent too. But it is not an EXCUSE as to why she is a bad parent. Because being a bad parent is inexcusable and always unacceptable. It was her one job to protect you from harm and she instead caused it. 

*Someone doesn‚Äôt have to have conscious ill intentions to hurt you.* If a friend stabbed you with a blade accidentally instead of stabbing you on purpose are you less dead because it was on accident?

Abuse is abuse and toxic all the same, regardless of the abuser thinks they love you or not. It‚Äôs not unreasonable to expect our parents to not hurt us. We expect better treatment from strangers. We have higher standards for our interactions with strangers, and when strangers fail to meet those expectations or respect our boundaries we react appropriately. We leave, we cut them off, they are out. 

What this sounds like is that you‚Äôve accommodated the mistreatment your mom gave you at your own expense. It happened because you trusted her like a normal child does, but she was not a normal parent. Sounds like she conditioned you to accept poor treatment, especially from those who love you and absolutely must be a safe haven through and through. It doesn‚Äôt matter if she meant to or not, the damage has been done regardless. It‚Äôs no surprise that you‚Äôre struggling to uphold boundaries in this situation now, even when the person you‚Äôre putting them up for actively poisoned your husband in an attempt to sabotage is life. 

It sounds like this wasn‚Äôt something you were told or taught or learnt: but **it‚Äôs ok to severely limit or completely eliminate contact with people who hurt you. Yes, even family. Especially family, because we let them in so much that if they damage us their cuts will land much closer to our core. It is ok because it‚Äôs your ONE responsibility on earth to protect yourself.**"
"I'm not sober or anything, but I'd still be incredibly pissed off with anyone who did this to me or anyone else. I've had my drink spiked before (no idea what with but I was unconscious), and no matter whether it's drugs or alcohol or whatever, it is absolutely reprehensible."
"I don‚Äôt think she knew at the time, but I do think she knew after-the-fact, as SD mentioned that he brought it up to my mom, and my mom got mad at him for it. But neither of them told us for a solid year - so that‚Äôs pretty crappy. 

Sorry though for the unclarity. I meant the ‚Äúdrama‚Äù of my husband having to walk out of the hospital room, make an emergency therapy call, and figure out how to still be in the same room as this guy, since we didn‚Äôt want to leave because my mom didn‚Äôt have 100% chance of waking up at the time. 

We looped her in after she was stable, but I think I need to be more clear about everything. I can be too gentle because I like to make people happy. Time to polish my spine, I guess. "
"Even the title makes me feel excited, haha. I often have to mother my own mom, as she has a lot of issues. I never thought about the fact that that probably stems from the fact that she‚Äôs a bit immature. But that makes so much sense - she often lashes out like a child. Thanks! "
"I‚Äôve read that before, and I also can‚Äôt get it out of my memory. So sad. "
If I remember correctly the daughter was allergic to anything that was derived from coconut oil :/ I‚Äôm not going to deny the mother of her place to share her story. It is rare in literature but not impossible. A few years ago there was a man dying of anaphylaxis from coconut cream from his wife‚Äôs homemade curry as well.
"I strongly suspect a decent number of the most dramatic JNMIL stories are fake. Reddit is, after all, anonymous and it‚Äôs easy to make shit up. "
I've unsubscribed to r/justnomil because so many stories where obviously fake and it reeks of misogyny. It's a shame because I have a justnomil myself and could have used the support. I don't understand why people would go to such length such as lying about a child death. They must be very damaged people but still. 
"Wow, I wish I could give things multiple upvotes. I definitely need to spin this around in my head a bit.

Thanks for bringing this up, and I‚Äôll definitely keep it in mind going forward. "
"Coconut cream is different than oil, the man allegedly also had a heart condition, and the only ‚Äúnews‚Äù reporting of it was the Daily Mail and the Telegraph, no medical journals.

"She went on dates while you were living together?  That sounds like a nightmare.

"Get your damn car and move your funds out. Now. Take every possession you hold dear and ask a friend to hold on to it.

This is an honorable fade away starting up. 

Get your stuff and get away from her. Protect yourself legally. NOW. Staying through this and trying to work thru it will nearly kill you. Please listen.

"Either she finds a new job or you break up. 

Is she in touch with him ? Because she sounds like a cheater ( the I love you but I'm not in love with you) if yes, it is possible she has an emotional affair. "
She would have stayed with the coworker before if not for his visa expiring. She's made it clear she cares more about him. Time to move on my friend.
">I‚Äôm kinda financially dependent on her because everything is in my name due to her credit being awful. 

Explanation please.  How does that make you dependent on her?  And if the car is in her name, she's responsible for it so it's not your problems."
Leave and be happy you are not married yet
Why would you want to be a back up plan?
If someone gets feelings for a coworker you should just call it and wish them well in life.  This is before marriage and kids so it's way better to bail now (even with debts) than afterwards.  This will ALWAYS happen again even if you do work things out now only next time it will be after you have 2 kids.
"so 1. feelings for coworker, which is bad enough but could be dealt with if she cuts all contact rn and focuses on you, but there's also 2. the fact that she says she doesn't even know if she's still in love with you

I mean, are you happy with that level of commitment? after only 2 years of relationship?"
The car is in both our names.   We have added several bills like o got a new car last year while we was together and talking about marriage. We have put more on credit cards sense we have been together that are in my name. If we were to split today. My monthly income would become about -$527 after I pay the monthly bills. When we got together I had roommates that I split the house expenses with and I would more that likely find new ones if she was to move out. Another thing I have talked to her about is getting a part time job but she didn‚Äôt like that idea because it would take away from us time. So I‚Äôm just not sure what to do. I do believe her when she says she loves me. Am I an idiot for believing that? Probably. I know that even with her telling me she has feelings for another guy I want us to stay together. I think this is just a phase she is going through. Again I‚Äôm probably an idiot but i honestly hope and what to see us get through this. 
There a very good question and I don‚Äôt have an answer for this. My head is all over the place still and can‚Äôt tell up from down. 
"Whatever you do about your relationship, you need to get your financial situation sorted out asap.  Get a second job if you have to.  You are in a ruinous position because of her and she objects because it would take away time from her --- and she is in love with someone else.

This was not smart at all OP.  can't love you too much if she'll make you go into debt for her.
"Being alone is rarely as bad as being with a woman who wants to be somewhere else.

Don't torture yourself.

Your future life partner is out there waiting for you, she wont find you whilst you're in a relationship."
As long as we are together then the payment are not an issue. They only become an issue if I‚Äôm paying for them alone because when we got everything I was under the presumption that it was a us purchase. 
"OP, you‚Äôre about to turn 30. You need to smarten up. If I‚Äôm reading your post correctly: You moved in with your girlfriend after a few months of dating her, broke up for a few months ~9 months ago, during which time she saw other people, including this coworker who she thought she was over (ostensibly only because he left the country, so she didn‚Äôt really have a choice). You got back together, and then thought it was a good idea to get engaged a few weeks later, on the heels of her seeing other people, and not only that, but you decided to commingle all of your finances, despite the fact that she has bad credit (hmmm... how does one end up with bad credit?), racked up debt that‚Äôs in your name only, bought a car with/for your fianc√©e (are you on the title or just the loan?), all while she doesn‚Äôt work? I‚Äôd be interested to hear what your thought process was during this time, because that kind of impulsivity and lack of foresight is something I‚Äôd expect from an 18-23 year old (roughly), not a 30 year old man. 

> As long as we are together then the payment are not an issue. 


And this is why it‚Äôs a really bad idea to get so financially intertwined with a SO before you‚Äôre married. I mean, looking at the situation objectively, your relationship was in no way stable enough for you to bet your credit and financial security on the relationship surviving long term. The odds were clearly not in your favor, but you doubled down. I can‚Äôt help but wonder if you were in some way trying to buy her love or commitment and/or show her, via spending money on her/‚Äúus‚Äù, how committed and serious you were. 

What should you do now? I think you should break up and take some time to work on yourself. If I had to guess, I‚Äôd say that you‚Äôre way more committed to and serious about this relationship than she is, and your feelings for her are much stronger than her feelings for you. Whether or not she loves you or is in love with you or is in love with this other guy ultimately doesn‚Äôt matter. This relationship is causing you to make reckless and irresponsible decisions that can easily, and most likely will, negatively affect your future. 

Similarly, you said that you can‚Äôt see your life without her, but you‚Äôve only been together for 2.5 years, which included one breakup as well as her dating and catching feelings for other people.  The fact that you desperately want this relationship to work, to the point where you‚Äôre willing to make huge, long term sacrifices that could cause you years of financial difficulties, is not healthy. The fact that you‚Äôre making these sacrifices for someone who, at best, has feelings for another man, and is therefore not ready to be married, is just dumb. 

The reality of being in a successful and fulfilling relationship is that you can‚Äôt try to do the work of two people while you‚Äôre partner barely pulls her weight and expect the relationship to work or last. So, yeah, you need to let her go and do some serious work on building up your self esteem and self worth so that you can have a mutually beneficial, loving and respectful relationship with the next woman. "
Why would you join finances with someone who you've know for such a short amount of time and who had shown to not be good with them?
I wish I could up vote this a thousand times 
"I've been through almost this exact situation with my boyfriend (same ages too!). We were the same as you in that we didn't want to make a big deal of the relationship either, so making some kind of announcement about our relationship didn't feel right. 

We just started dropping it casually into conversations. For the purpose of this post, let's say my boyfriend's name is X. If someone asked me if I was dating anyone at the moment, I'd be open and say that I was dating X. Or if people asked me if I was doing anything over the weekend, or if I had plans on a Friday night, I'd say something like, ""I'm not sure if you've heard, but I'm actually dating X, so I'm going to be spending it with him.""

If they asked me how long we'd been dating, I just told them a few months, but was very open with other details. I also made a point to mention that we weren't trying to hide it from anyone, but just wanted to keep it on the downlow until we were sure it was a serious relationship. 

You'll find that in a workplace, once one person knows, other people will start to find out organically through word of mouth (in can't be overplayed how much people love to gossip in work places). I only had to tell a handful of people at the office, and within two weeks, everyone knew. 

If even one of you is reasonably well-liked at your workplace, you'll find that no one will accuse you of being dishonest or shady, but will love that you two are together and will be very congratulatory. Or at least, my boyfriend and I were very lucky in that we found that to be the case for us.

My only word of caution: it sounds like you're confident that it won't be a conflict of interest to be working together, but I would double check the HR rules just in case. I did make it clear to my performance manager that we were dating just in case it was an issue, but they were happy that we were upfront about it. "
"My wife and I did that for a time. And I've seen other couples do it too. The reaction has always been very positive. I don't think we were particularly hiding, it just wasn't anyone else's business. Then we had a realignment and I was to be her supervisor so we had to go more public since I needed to trade her.

Don't be too surprised if a fair percentage of people already know. From seeing a look or a smile or a wink. "
"We just started causally mentioning it while discussing past weekends and stuff like that. Since we worked so close together I've been adamant about being professional in meetings, interactions in the hallways, discussing his job performance with other collegues etc. Some already suspected it, some were very surprised. It cools down after a while."
"Been there and done that. 5yr friendship, 6 month relationship before we told anyone and moved in together at the 6 month mark. She‚Äôs a supervisor at my part-time job. I have a full time job elsewhere. Just start being seen together and let problem find it for themselves. That‚Äôs what we did slowly people found out and word for around. Nobody was surprised and all were happy. "
"Are we the same person? I could have written this post almost word for word (except we are still in the same large department). 

Our policy is basically we're not advertising it but we're not hiding it anymore. If anyone asks, we will confirm but otherwise we both feel it's nobody's business. On days he is working in the office, which isn't often, we sometimes drive in together and nobody has ever commented. We just sort of have taken the live and let live approach. We also assume people have figured it out and will ask if they absolutely need to know. "
"I met my husband at work. We worked on the same team but lived in different locations. After talking for a long time, we decided it was time to meet. As anyone working in a globally diverse office knows, a way to get a vacation without burning time off is to go work at another location for a bit. Husband asked for permission, boss asked why. 

- husband; to go meet lawrish
- boss: no, really
- husband: really
- boss: c'mon, tell me
- husband: fine, music festival
- boss: ok, have fun!

We met, hit it off, relationship progressed, boss still thought it was a joke.

Time passes, we got married. We go to a work lunch, I sit next to husband, boss in front of him, guy from another department in front of me.

- Guy: you're wearing the same ring, are you married?
- me: yeah
- boss: WHAT

And that's how everyone found out. We still laugh at it.

Anyway, now for the advice. To people in my location we just mentioned it casually and they took the hint. Rumour Mill also helped. No need to excuse yourself for keeping it private, just be nonchalant.

Good luck!"
Thanks!! Very helpful!! I'll check with hr to be sure were in the clear. 
"Yes, this is in fact emotional abuse. Look out for yourself here and protect yourself. She's deliberately trying to hurt you and make you feel bad, such as with the driving. I would get an individual counselor for yourself to help you figure out howbest to get out of this."
"I got to the erratic driving, and yes, she's abusive. That's terrifying. I'm so sorry you had to go through the PTSD attack. 

For some insight into her (goes for guys, too) behavior, she sounds like from her past abuse, she is so used to a roller coaster-type of relationship, that she can't be in an even-keeled one. For someone like that, a calm conversation seems flat and suspicious. Believe it or not, if you had stormed after her after she accused you of cheating and gotten into a screaming match with her, she would have felt more secure and loved--as BACKWARDS as that is (and you did everything so well with being gentle and reassuring, so bravo!). Another problem for people like this is that if you guys are cruising along, having a great day/weekend/month, they will actually pick a fight because feeling happy actually makes them UNCOMFORTABLE. Whether she doesn't think she deserves happiness or she thinks that your being sweet means you're secretly siphoning money to go live in Chile with your secret lover, it doesn't matter. She would rather blow up at you than be serene because serene makes her skin crawl. She is that unused to it. For her, she is so used to the highest highs and the lowest lows that this seems NORMAL to her. 

**But the whys don't matter right now, if ever.** Her reactions to you with her family, the violence, the accusations and jealousy, the insecurity, the ""forgetting"" fights (because BS), her blowouts...she is abusing you. She needs to be in intensive therapy ASAP. I can't tell from your post if you live together, but if you do, someone needs to leave immediately, preferably her. She is absolutely abusing you. 

People who are addicted to this volatility can come back from it (and I say this only because she hasn't hit you--yet. sigh). It takes a big change, but she can get to a point where contentment and calm in a relationship are actually positives to her. But she is so far from that goal that I don't know if she can get there. 

Do you have a therapist of your own? Make a plan for what you want to do. If possible, sit her down and tell her that you cannot continue in this situation. (She's triggering your PTSD. Come on!) She will go into one of her histrionic rages and be melodramatic (""remember I loved you""), but you're going to need to stand strong. Don't give into her vitriol. Tell her she needs help, and that there is no ""us"" until that happens. And do not let her shove this under the rug. **Therapy or no relationship. I see you wrote that she doesn't want therapy. In that case, she doesn't want you.** 

As it stands, this is not sustainable. I wish you so much luck!"
"Also, you should absolutely reply to that text where she asks if you had sex. Embarrass yourself if need be but answer with facts. She seems like the type who would accuse you of doing something that you didn‚Äôt in order to hurt you later. "
"I'm currently in a relationship in which both of us came from past abusive relationships also. His ex girlfriend used to be exactly like your girlfriend is and he was traumatised by her to the point of trying to kill himself (luckily he didn't succeed). It took us more than a year for him to heal, and that meant me constantly reassuring him, being open and communicative and of course never get mad without saying why. 

Anyway what I'm trying to say is... She is definitely abusive with you. Definitely. It doesn't matter what her past is, what she is doing to you is inexcusable and she's making your life miserable, and you don't deserve this. Nobody does. She is not going to change and you need to run away as far and fast as you can. My boyfriend also thought he loved her, but what he has was dependency and hopes about what she could be (but she wasn't) and in little moments in which she was sweet with him (not worth the pain of the rest). When you find someone reasonable and that cares about you enough as to treat you with love and respect you'll realise what real love is like. It's not supposed to be about being permanently scared, sad, walking on eggshells and anxious, it's supposed to be *easy* and happy. 

Please run away, this is only going to get worse.

Best of luck and lots of love to you. <3"
"She needs therapy, and you need to break up. She's also a lot older than you. Wouldn't you rather be with someone closer to your own age who treated you lovingly?"
"35M,  the behaviors you describe -- i.e., verbal abuse, physical abuse (driving erratically to make you sick), emotional  instability, temper tantrums, insecurity,  lack of impulse control, always being ""The Victim,"" and  rapid flips  between Jekyll (loving you) and  Hyde  (hating you)  --  are  warning signs for BPD  (Borderline Personality Disorder).

Importantly,  I'm  not  suggesting  your GF has full-blown BPD.  Instead, I'm suggesting   she  may  be  exhibiting moderate to strong BPD symptoms.  Of  course,  learning  to spot BPD warning  signs will not  enable you  to diagnose her  issues.  Although strong BPD  symptoms are easy  to  spot, only a  professional can  determine  whether they are so severe and persistent  as to constitute a   full-blown disorder.

Yet, like learning warning signs for a stroke or heart attack,  learning  those for BPD  may  help you avoid a very painful situation -- e.g., by helping  you leave a toxic relationship and avoid running into  the arms of another woman just like her.  I  therefore  suggest you take  a  quick look at these BPD warning signs to see if most sound very  familiar:

1. Black-white   thinking, wherein she categorizes everyone as ""all good"" or ""all bad""   and will recategorize someone -- in just a few  seconds --  from  one  polar  extreme to the other based on a minor infraction;
2. Frequent use of all-or-nothing expressions like ""you always"" and ""you never;""
3. Irrational jealousy and controlling behavior that tries to isolate you away from close friends or family members;
4. A   strong sense of entitlement that prevents her from appreciating  your     sacrifices, resulting in a ""what have you done for me  lately?""    attitude  and a double standard;
5. Flipping, on a dime, between adoring you and devaluing you -- making you feel like you're always walking on eggshells;
6. Frequently creating drama over issues so minor that neither of you can recall what the fight was about two days later;
7. Low self esteem;
8. Verbal  abuse and anger that is easily triggered, in seconds, by a  minor        thing   you say or do (real or imagined), resulting in temper    tantrums     that   typically last several hours;
9. Fear of abandonment or being alone -- evident in her expecting you to  ‚Äúbe there‚Äù for her on demand, making unrealistic demands for the  amount   of    time spent together, or responding with intense anger to    even    brief   separations or slight changes in plans;
10. Always being ""The Victim,"" a false self image she validates by blaming you for every misfortune;
11. Lack of impulse control, wherein she does reckless things without considering the consequences (e.g., binge eating or spending);
12. Complaining that all her previous BFs were abusive and  claiming, during the first     few months of your relationship,  that you are the only one  who has treated her  well;
13. Mirroring your personality and preferences so perfectly during  the courtship       period (e.g., enjoying everything and everyone you  like)  that you were convinced you had met your ""soul mate;""
14. Relying   on you to center and ground her, giving her a sense of  direction because her goals otherwise keep changing every few months;
15. Relying on you to sooth her and calm her down, when she is stressed, because she has so little ability to do self soothing;
16. Having no close long-term friends (unless they live a long distance away) even though she may have many casual friends;
17. Taking   on the personality of whatever person she is talking to,  thereby   acting quite differently around different types of people;  and
18. Always   convinced that her intense feelings accurately reflect   reality -- to the point that she often ""rewrites history"" because she regards her own   feelings as self-evident facts, despite her inability to support them with any hard evidence.

If most of those behaviors ring bells and raise questions, I would be  glad to discuss them with you -- and I would recommend that you see a psychologist (for a visit or two all by yourself) to obtain a candid professional opinion on what you're dealing with.

I caution that BPD is not something --   like chickenpox -- that a person  either *""has""*  or *""doesn't have.""*  Instead, it is a spectrum disorder,  which  means  every adult on   the planet occasionally exhibits all BPD traits  to  some  degree   (usually  at a low level if the person is healthy).

At  issue, then, is  not whether your GF exhibits BPD  traits.  Of  course she does.  We  all do.  Rather, at issue is whether she exhibits those traits at a strong level  (i.e., is on the upper  end of  the BPD spectrum).  

If her BPD traits are strong, another important issue is whether they have been persistent since her teens (i.e., arising from lifetime BPD) or are a temporary flareup of her normal BPD traits (i.e., perhaps caused by menopausal hormone changes, as JJGill suggested above).

Not having  met her, I  cannot answer those two questions about BPD strength and persistence.  I nonetheless  believe you can spot any  strong BPD warning  signs that are  present if  you  take a   little   time to learn which  behaviors are on the list.  "
"Definitely emotional abuse. Please be mindful of yourself around her. You may love her to bits but this isn't a person you can reason with. She put you in danger with her driving, knowing well that you react badly to it. Also, assuming that you've had sex with other women and holding it against you, that's just an excuse to use you as her punching bag for her many insecurities. She doesn't see reason. Her wolrdview is likely skewed because of her previous experiences, but this is no excuse for her shitty behavior. 

As others have suggested, therapy (either alone or together) is the only option. Otherwise, just drop the relationship, OP. You seem awesome and deserve so much better.   "
">Not sure what to do at this point.

You get the fuck out of there.

She's absolutely abusing you. Somewhere out there is a woman who will reciprocate your love instead of making you guess why she's mad this minute. She's out there, man. And she won't """"""forget"""""" stuff conveniently to get away with hurting you. If someone regularly made me try to figure out why they were mad, I would walk. If a girl expected me to be a mind reader, she'd get a warning to start communicating or I'd walk."
"I'm not sure she's healed from the past. 

Experienced something similar. Was in a relationship where we both had cheating abusive ex's previously. I healed significantly faster than they did, and some times we would be fighting the arguments of their past. 

By that I mean, arguments that had nothing to do with us, that started at the level of being from a dying marriage, and were most commonly about a simple miscommunication that previously would of meant more. 

It was an abusive relationship, that wasn't. 

Not sure if any of that helps or not. Ultimately, she may not be able to break from her past while being with you. What you want to do about that is up to you, but if you stay, try and get a neutral third party to mediate.

The main struggle, is just learning how to be with someone again, because it means letting go of all the pain from the past. 

Of course, I might be completely wrong. 

Good luck either way"
"If you love her more than anything in the world, you love her more than yourself. Which is the perfect way to end in a codependent relationship.  

Then she can project infidelity on you, that's possible too."
This is abuse I‚Äôm afraid. Try to safely remove yourself from the situation as quickly as possible and look after yourself. I‚Äôm sorry that this is happening to you. 
"She is abusive and if she doesn't chance (99% don't) you should leave. You are very young and can find a new woman no problem. You need to value yourself more highly. 

What is your opinion of yourself? How would you describe yourself?

My heart is really going out to you - I'm sorry.

Also - what culture do you come from? (just seemed like an arranged marriage type situation with your first marriage).
"
"dude, why are you doing this to yourself? GET OUT.

She is insane, being abusive or not is not the point here (even though i think she is) , the silent treatment alone is a behavior inappropriate for a 15 yo old let alone a 47 years old woman! If you add the erratic behaviour, jealousy and overall shitty attitude she has towards you i really wonder, WHY??

also the final bit about her telling you she must be ugly or too old, GOOD GOD. She is pulling the pity card to justify her abuse, DO NOT LET HER. It's the oldesttrick in the book. She acts shitty then tell you stuff so you will pity her and wear your white cape (which you totally did) in order to save her. STOP the cycle!"
"What the hell man? She picks you up angry and giving you the silent treatment for no discernable reason, then drives like a maniac purposely to try and make you sick, neither of you are able to clear up what the hell is going on yet you try to have sex with her that night as if everything is fine and normal? This relationship is coo coo for coco puffs off the charts crazy. 

This is not your first time being in an abusive relationship which is why you're responding/not responding the way that you are. Get your butt to therapy or at least (if money is an issue)   some therapy books or something cause you need help. "
"I wonder if she is menopausal - the hormones can cause such erratic behaviour. It doesn‚Äôt excuse it, but it may go some way to explaining it. "
This is the best advice you will get by far.
I‚Äôve saved this comment as it is such great advice. Thank you.
"OP - I've learned that even if your abusive girlfriend is not bona fide diagnosed with BPD, you still can learn a lot from learning how other people deal with their partners. Breaking up is really hard, with someone with BPD tendencies. You can do it! r/BPDlovedones  (...it's also really hard staying with someone with BPD-like behaviors!) 

She can work through her behaviors with therapy (regardless of diagnosis), but the fact that she deliberately is choosing to not seek treatment is a real problem, and a reason to leave the toxic relationship."
"Her behavior is still abusive to OP, even if her behavior is due to past dysfunction. That doesn't change the behavior itself and the damage it will due to OP."
"Thanks!

I‚Äôve actually spoke ar length with her best friend and sister... and we came to the same solution. She is making me pay for the mistakes in her past relationships. 

I agree on needing probably counseling and mediation, but she is extreme against having a third party. In her words, it‚Äôs between the two of us, it does not involve anybody else and we shouldn‚Äôt bother other people. 

Her sister thought about talking to her, but we are afraid that just broaching the subject will set her off and she won‚Äôt be open to listening to anything. 

Any other ideas?"
This should be pinned to the sub. It's an insight on partners who've been through abuse that's more sensitive and comprehensive than anything I've read. 
Agreed. Didn't say otherwise. Was just trying to offer what little I can due to my own life experiences. 
"Honestly? 

It's been 2 years. If it were me, it would be line in the sand time. Would approach it as working on us, we need help. Let's go see some help together to get through this rough patch, because I honestly won't be able to continue like this. Then set a date, and stick to your words. 

I would not tell her you need help and your friends, family, and I all agree, because that means you've been talking about her behind her back, makes her look foolish, and makes it seem like everyone is out to get her. "
"> In her words, it‚Äôs between the two of us, it does not involve anybody else and we shouldn‚Äôt bother other people.

So, she doesn't want any witnesses.  I wonder why."
"I actually think it's probably a blessing in disguise that she won't see a counselor with you. Don't get me wrong, she absolutely needs individual therapy. However, marital counseling is usually not recommended in abusive relationships like yours. The abusive partner tends to use things revealed in the session against their victim. Plus, the whole approach is generally based on compromise, understanding, communication--all wonderful things in a relationship, but things you cannot do with an unreasonable partner. And a partner who freaks out over you having a casual phone conversation, who punishes you for having a good relationship with her family, who abuses you at all is not a reasonable partner.

I'm sorry I don't have any better advice than leaving her, even if only temporarily. I do believe that abusers can change, but it takes a lot of work and they have to want to do it. There's no magic word to say or technique to use to get her to realize how abusive she is being (if she doesn't already know; abusers tend to be more aware of what they're doing than people think). And you can't just sit around being her figurative punching bag until she decides to change, if ever. Not to mention that abuse tends to escalate over time, so you may become her literal punching bag at some point. The driving thing is already crossing into physical abuse territory IMO.

As you figure things out, you might want to read ""Why Does He Do That?"" by Lundy Bancroft, which is all about abusive relationships and the psychology behind this kind of behavior. As the title implies, Bancroft does talk more about men abusing women, but he talks about  women abusing men as well, and most of it is just general stuff that applies to either gender. He explains it more in the introduction, too."
"Honestly man you need to leave and deal with your own issues, this lady is incredibly toxic and abusive and will tear you down. You're not obligated to save her. "
"> she is extreme against having a third party. In her words, it‚Äôs between the two of us, it does not involve anybody else and we shouldn‚Äôt bother other people.

Then you need to leave. She is telling you she doesn't want to do the work to fix this. It's over if she's unwilling to get help. If nobody can talk to her about this without ""setting her off,"" it's over. You need to end this because it's not going to change. She's made her decision, and made it clear that if you're in a relationship with her, this is how it will be. And that's abusive. Leave and put this behind you."
You should leave friend. You could find someone else who cares and isn't a b.
"When I read that line, I recalled that this is what pedophiles say to their victims repeatedly, and it made my freaking skin crawl..."
"You aren't sticking up for your boyfriend. If I was him, I'd leave you because I've been in his shoes before, and nothing is more disrespectful or infuriating than someone who doesn't stand up for their partner. You said it yourself, this guy is great, cleans your house and brings you food (da fuq I don't even do that for the girl I'm seeing right now). He sounds like a solid guy, and HE'S STILL AROUND despite the fact you two haven't hooked up yet.  I don't care if your best friend is Jesus himself, you are supposed to stick up for your partner come hell or high water, and you aren't doing it.

You're right, the situation is crazy and not your problem. Just like how he can claim you having an asshole friend is not his problem and he decides to be single."
"You know how someone said you aren't sticking up for your partner? While, I understand you don't want to end a 3 year friendship, someone who is really your friend won't try to push your partner's buttons, especially if they know it will start a fight.

You gotta ask both yourself and her why she is challenging him. Usually this happens cause the friend feels threatened by the new boo."
"How'd you feel if someone bragged spitefully to you, in front of everyone, about having sex with him?"
"Your boyfriend is upset that you aren‚Äôt sticking up for him. This is your friend who is making jabs at him that he‚Äôs made it clear he doesn‚Äôt appreciate. You don‚Äôt have to choose sides necessarily but if one of them is in the wrong, it‚Äôs ok to call them out on it. It sounds like your friend is intentionally egging him on to get a ride out of him and you‚Äôre standing by saying it‚Äôs ok for her to do so. 

He shouldn‚Äôt get as heated as he is, however, if he‚Äôs made it clear in the past that he isn‚Äôt ok with It and it continues, I can‚Äôt blame him for not sticking around to deal with it. "
"How do you feel that it's not your problem? This guy sounds that he is treating you really well. You have not stood up for him or shut down your bffs behavior. He can very well be posting on reddit and people here would advising him to dump you. How would you feel if you read what you wrote and swapped out you and him? He had a threesome with his bestfriend. Who brings it up to you and you guys haven't even had sex yet. Would you just be ""overreacting"" if you got upset? Similar incidents happen and he doesnt want to chose sides because its ""not his problem""."
"Are you sure you can't cut your bff? She's mistreating your boyfriend every chance she gets and sabotaging your relationship with him. If you don't stand up for him, you're going to lose him."
This is not about taking sides over bff and boyfriend. It‚Äôs about calling out the person who is wrong. If your past is your past great.... then your dickhead of a bff should not be throwing your past in your boyfriends face. Here‚Äôs a guy doing his best and you are standing back letting your bff taking jabs at him. By not doing anything about it you are just as responsible. He should break up with you so that you can go back to dating the type of guy you actually deserve. 
"You‚Äôve got to stick up for your boyfriend man! If your friend can‚Äôt be nice to him, don‚Äôt hang out with both of them together. It sounds like he has made it clear that he doesn‚Äôt like the way this friend speaks to him, but this friend won‚Äôt respect his boundaries. Your friend sounds like a jerk"
Your best friend is being awful to your new bf - have you even talked to her about it? I would definitely a dip a new relationship if my SO had a mean friend like that. It‚Äôs not worth the trouble of being with someone who will not stand up to you even when there‚Äôs a pretty clear wrong/right side. Your best friend seems to be marking you as hers every chance she gets. I wouldn‚Äôt expect this to change with any guy you date and I absolutely would expect it to drive away more. 
"She made a jab about the threesome 2 more times after the initial group announcement? Like, a jealous ex-lover trying to stake her claim? You need to talk to your BFF and find out exactly why she can't let this go and why she feels the need to poke at your boyfriend. "
"Your best friend is a lousy friend.  She should not be discussing your sex life with anyone and she's disrespecting you by doing so.

If I were your boyfriend I would nope out of there and find someone that is willing to stand by him when their friend with poor boundaries starts picking fights."
"You completely off base with this one. Honestly your bff sounds like a completely horrible person. How can you be blindsided by this. Would you be mad if your boyfriend brought over a bunch of friends and just sat around insulting you and he just told you to avoid them if you don‚Äôt like it? I‚Äôm mean it‚Äôs all on him for choosing to still be in a relationship with you, but I really don‚Äôt see how this is a big mystery when your friend is being so malicious in trying to break you up."
"You need to stand up for your boyfriend as soon as this happens again. Don‚Äôt pull them aside and talk to them separately, or deal with it later, or brush it off. Next time she says something rude to him, stop her and tell her that she‚Äôs being rude and needs to cut it out. It doesn‚Äôt have to be a big scene, just call it out and make it clear that it‚Äôs not okay for her to shit on your boyfriend for no reason in front of you. 

Two of my friends bicker because one is sensitive and the other can be a little rude and oblivious, and when I see the sensitive friend‚Äôs feelings are hurt I defend them. It‚Äôs never been an issue and the rude friend usually catches on and apologizes. If your friend can‚Äôt handle being called out for being nasty to someone you care about, she sucks and isn‚Äôt a very good friend."
Your BF is 30? Your BFF 25? They are adults. They should be able to handle their differences without blaming it on you. Your boyfriend especially. He left without telling you? That's very inconsiderate of him. And your Best Friend should value your wish to keep a relationship with your BF. But honestly... he needs some thicker skin.
"His tendency to dramatize things will not change over the course of your relationship. Even if you do keep them separated, it will come up again some way or another. It's also very telling that he wouldn't talk about it until you basically dragged it out of him. "
"Crikey, she's gone after him about this one thing *three times* in *two weeks*. Which sounds likely to be literally every time he's seen her. That's ridiculous, of course he's not going to put up with it. 

It also sounds kinda like the ""BFF"" is acting like a jealous ex, and OP is going to keep losing relationships until she forces the friend to stop."
No. An adult does not sit around and watch their friend try to sexually one up their SO and throw jabs at every chance they get. What the friend did was incredibly inappropriate. And Op was absolutely wrong to let it get this far. Her friend means her responsibility to draw boundaries. Quite honestly the boyfriend should have dumped her after her first blas√© reaction to her friend‚Äôs inappropriateness. Nobody should be in a relationship with someone who sits by and watches friends/family actively manipulate and undermine the relationship. 
"Well I think he didn't want to talk about again becuase they have obviously had the same discussion over and over and nothing has changed. Could he develop a thicker skin? Maybe, but he has made it clear that the comments make them uncomfortable and they keep happening. She can stand up for her boyfriend without losing her BFF. This doesn't have to be a choose one scenario. "
"This is very true. I did not voice my original thought correctly, my apologies. When I said the BF should respect the OP's relationship, I meant she shouldn't be trying to interfere (with the one uppmanship/undermining.) Like she has been doing. 

Nevertheless, the BF should have told the OP before he left. And the OP should have standed up for him more forcefully. 

Thank you for calling me out. ^_^ I was wrong. "
"It doesn't have to but it would be for me. If my ""bff"" chose to alienate my partner knowing full well that it would set them off and cause an argument, they'd be my ex-bff real fast. What a cunt of a person."
"I tend to agree with you, but I like to keep my advice open ended. I don't know everything about the scenario and the OP could be leaving out some info.

However, I think her BFF was obviously threatened by OPs new relationship and is trying to belittle it. Like why should a close friend feel the need to trash talk OPs boyfriend when they express a genuine feeling of closeness? Like maybe one joke about it is ok. But to keep twisting the same knife over and over is bizzare and just mean. And yah if she kept doing it I would choose my new SO over her any day. But I would still sit down and defend my boyfriend from her attacks.

If the two girls are as close as OP makes it out I just feel like they could come to an understanding in all of this mess. "
"I feel like this post defines irrational as ""things that don't matter to me"". Having some ripped up box of pads that doesn't close properly anymore is kind of annoying and shows a lack of care with using her things (why were you getting pads anyhow?). Is it a small issue? Yes. But you've dubbed it ""illogical"" just because you don't care, which is absolutely an incorrect thing. 

Your gf cares, and she's expressing that she cares about it, and instead of being ""Oh sorry I'll be more careful next time,"" you double down and tell her she's being irrational. Not smart and not helpful.

>She now got more upset and said why can‚Äôt I just simply apologize instead of making excuses.

Well she nailed you there. You were making excuses. When somebody says they are annoyed with the way you opened a box of theirs, you say ""Oops sorry I'll open it correctly next time"". You don't say ""YOU'RE IRRATIONAL AND I'M THE RATIONAL ONE!"" unless you're just an asshole.

"
"I mean, if she pays extra for the packaging that opens a particular way(I‚Äôm guessing for ease of dispensing) and you just rip it open from the side, you wasted her money. That‚Äôs not an irrational thing to get annoyed about, that‚Äôs a ‚Äúyou wasted my money with your carelessness‚Äù. Yes, the pads are still useable but the box that she paid extra for is not."
"A few people are intentionally misreading you, but I get what you're trying to say. Basically you felt that you did not deserve the level of anger you received for merely opening a box differently than she expected.

The way you've described the situation, I personally agree with you. Nothing you've said so far makes me suspicious that you are habitually ignoring or unfairly dismissing her concerns.

Here is what is leaping out at me about your situation. You feel like you are getting unfair amounts of grief from your girlfriend to the point where you are compelled to ask strangers on the internet for validation. Think about that for a moment, because it's important.

You're focusing on whether or not your girlfriend is ""justified"" or ""reasonable"" for getting upset over things that are, in my opinion, relatively small issues. I think the thing that other commenters are trying to point out to you is that it doesn't matter whether or not she's justified. It's just the way she feels. What you need to think about is how YOU feel when someone is constantly taking you to task for things that you perceive as trivial. I know that I'd be pretty miserable if someone got upset at every tiny thing I did.

The question I want to pose to you is this: do you think it's possible that you're focusing so much on her reasoning and her processes because it's a way to avoid thinking about how it makes you feel when she lashes out like this? Perhaps it's a way to avoid the possibility that this one issue might be a dealbreaker in a relationship you're otherwise happy with?

Whatever your answer, I hope you find a healthy solution to your woes."
"I mean it sounds like you do really annoying things and then when she expresses annoyance get super defensive, which is invalidating and infuriating. If you have a history of doing this (which I‚Äôm guessing you do) it may have taught her to come in primed for a fight whenever she expresses annoyance because she knows you won‚Äôt just apologize and will insist that she shouldn‚Äôt be upset that you opened a box in a manner that will make her life more frustrating for as long as the cotton pads last. 

Usually when people respond disproportionately it‚Äôs either because there is something else going on in their life that makes an annoyance hit harder and overwhelming, or because they know from past experience it won‚Äôt be as simple as ‚Äúugh dude please open the box properly this is annoying‚Äù ‚Äúugh I didn‚Äôt even realize, sorry babe, I‚Äôll pay more attention next time!‚Äù"
"""I calmly and very slowly explained to her that I was sorry for opening the box incorrectly.""

So, you're being a patronizing ass when someone tells you that you upset them. That's going to piss most people off. You're going to put her on the defensive. Try asking *why* she's pissed off.

""But I also said in a calm and deliberate way, that the product inside the box was not affected by the way the box was incorrectly opened - and that the box still held all the pads just fine. And for that reason, it should still be o.k.""

I mean, a bag of cereal can still hold cereal, whether you cut the corner off or cut it open along the long edge. Which is the more convenient method? Which is going to result in less spillage? Cutting the corner off. 

The toy thing I might understand. However, you did exactly what she accused you of and turned it back on her as soon as she spoke to you. You could have said, ""I'm sorry, I didn't know you were trying to keep the dog out of the bedroom. Just tell me next time and I'll keep the door closed while I take a nap.""

(Though, I have to wonder. Has she had pets before, and you have not? Most pet owners shut the door to any rooms they don't want their pets in. It would be unfair for her to assume you knew that, but it might explain why she was upset with you.)

""And when I try to explain the non-proportionate reactions she has to issues she views it as me ‚Äúturning it on her‚Äù or me ‚Äúmaking excuses for my behavior‚Äù instead of ‚Äújust owning up to it"".""

No, no. Do not tell someone they are irrational for being upset with you. She told you she was upset, she told you why, and you turned it around on her. You do not get to decide if someone's feelings are 'valid' enough for you to concern yourself with or apologize for.

How long have you two been in a relationship? If it's been a few years, she's probably being defensive because she knows you have no interest in why she's upset with you. That you value 'being right' more than her feelings on something.

You two could definitely benefit from couple's therapy so you can learn to communicate with each other."
"Your whole idea of trying to deal with someone who's upset by getting into a debate about why their feelings aren't logical is fundamentally misguided and self defeating. It's never going to work. All it accomplishes is pissing the other person off even worse. 

Having said that, to me, your girlfriend was being a nasty [gendered insult not allowed in this sub] in both of your examples. It seems like she gets pissed off and decides that the solution is to punish you by being purposefully mean and hateful rather than address the issue in a productive way. 

Your whole story is full of childishness and a lack of understanding of how to communicate respectfully and constructively on both sides, and you both need to do a ton of work on your communication skills. "
Good god she can't deal with a box being opened the wrong way? This chick is way too high strung.
"Honestly, it sounds like she's just looking for things to be pissed at you about."
"Has she previously told you that she hates it when you open the boxes that way? Some people will care about these little details and some won't - if she never told you anything about her preference then I think she might have been overreacting. However if she constantly asked you to open things ""correctly"" and you ignored that then I understand why she would've been pissed. Perhaps you could find a way to compromise by gluing the flaps together and swearing that from then on you'll always open them correctly. "
">**She gets upset for nonlogical non-reasonable reasons.** 

Theo, when someone frequently gets very angry and upset for ""irrational"" reasons, you likely are triggering a great fear she has.  When triggered, that fear produces very intense feelings such as anger.  

As you must already know, the human condition is that intense feelings distort and color our perceptions of another person's intentions and motivations.  This is true for ALL of us.

By the time we are in high school, nearly all of us realize that our judgment flies out the window whenever we experience very intense feelings.  This is why we try to keep our mouths shut -- and our fingers off the keys -- until we have time to cool down.

I mention this because, in your 4-year relationship with her, you may have noticed a pattern of behaviors that indicates whether your GF has a great fear that is distorting her perception of your intentions.

For example, has your GF been exhibiting a strong fear of abandonment (starting during the first year of your relationship)?  If so, this fear would have been evident in her being jealous over minor events or in  attempts to isolate you away from your close friends and family members.  It also would have been evident in an inability to trust that you truly love her.

Also, did you see  evidence that she relies heavily on black-white thinking, wherein she  tends to categorize everyone (who is close to her) as ""all good"" or ""all  bad"" -- and may recategorize someone in a few seconds from one polar  extreme to the other based on a minor statement or harmless action?"
"\> I calmly and very slowly explained to her  that I was sorry for opening the box incorrectly. But I also said in a  calm and deliberate way, that the product inside the box was not  affected by the way the box was incorrectly opened - and that the box  still held all the pads just fine. And for that reason, it should still  be o.k.

\> This made things worse. She now  got more upset and said why can‚Äôt I just simply apologize instead of  making excuses. I explained I wasn‚Äôt making excuses, but rather calmly  putting forth a rational conversation unemotionally

Well, of course it made it worse.  She had her reasons for wanting to open the box the way she wanted to.  Whether or not you understood those reasons, they were her reasons.  Maybe she didn't want to experience a minor annoyance every time she wanted to get a cotton pad out.  Maybe she didn't like the way the box looked when it was torn open.  Maybe the torn-open box doesn't fit into the drawer it's supposed to fit into.  Whatever.  And now she gets to hear someone talk down to her like she's a mentally deficient child and ""explain"" that it's irrational for her to think what she's thinking, and don't take her reasons seriously.  (Your view is ""logical"" and her view is ""irrational"")

How often do you go into ""calmly and very slowly explaining"" mode while completely ignoring her reasoning?  Do it enough times and she's going to get preemptively annoyed to avoid the ""very slow explanation""."
"You know - I‚Äôm gonna go against the grain here and say that there are things that are not worth creating conflict over. I don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs ‚Äúimportant to her‚Äù as some here have mentioned. It‚Äôs idiotic to make this into some sort of principle issue. Your GF has a pretty skewed sense of which hills to die on and I guarantee that it will be indicative of future behaviors. I‚Äôm not one of those ‚Äúrun!‚Äù folks you‚Äôll find on here, but I do encourage you to think about if you really want to be with someone who picks fights with you over stupid shit. Sounds like you‚Äôre walking on eggshells. "
"I think it is not about how to open boxes or chew toys but some other underlying reason. Maybe it just was the last drop, and it is really about something else. If you asked her warmly why she is upset. Get to the reason behind her acting out. Maybe she feels ignored, maybe she feels you don‚Äôt take her seriously, maybe she stressed out because of work.  I don‚Äôt know it could be anything, just ask her and try to get to the bottom of it together.
 "
Your girlfriend sounds crazy.
"In both cases, instead of just apologizing you tried to explain to her why she shouldn‚Äôt be upset and made it clear you didn‚Äôt think her concerns were valid, or blamed her for the problem. Both things were mildly annoying, but things build up in a relationship, especially if you‚Äôre living together. I think a good way to handle things like this in the future is to say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, I didn‚Äôt realize X. I‚Äôll be sure not to do it again.‚Äù Try that for a while and see if she stops being as angry about minor, but still annoying, things. If that doesn‚Äôt work, try initiating a conversation (when you‚Äôre both calm and not arguing) about why she starts off angry when you unintentionally do something that annoys her. Let her know that if she just asks you not to do X again, you won‚Äôt do it, but that it makes you feel bad when she‚Äôs angry at you for something you didn‚Äôt realize would be annoying. 

Yes, her level of anger was disproportionate, but maybe her disproportionate anger is a direct result of previous interactions where you made it clear that her being annoyed by things isn‚Äôt something you take seriously if it‚Äôs not something that would annoy you. You seem to be working off of the assumption that if something is not annoying to you, it‚Äôs illogical for it to be annoying to anyone else. This isn‚Äôt how people work. I‚Äôd also like to point out that it‚Äôs not logical to try to convince someone out of their anger. If you want things to be logical, start with your reactions to her being upset with you.

The opposite could also be true, and maybe your justifying things instead of just apologizing is the result of her continually snapping at you over small things, causing you to feel the need to defend yourself. None of us can know from this one post, but it sounds like one of those two things is happening. I still suggest you start (because you can‚Äôt control her behavior, but you can control yours) by always apologizing for little things that upset her and making it clear that you think it‚Äôs a valid thing to be upset by and it won‚Äôt happen again. If you‚Äôre honestly doing that and she‚Äôs still angry, then it‚Äôs time to talk to her about why she gets so angry. Overall, this is a relatively minor issue in a relationship if things are otherwise good and whatever the cause is I think it can be fixed fairly easily. "
"You sound really careless and honestly I‚Äôd feel the same as your gf.  Have some respect for other people‚Äôs things.  Also why were you opening this box of pads?  Because you were using one of them?  I think next time they get bought it‚Äôs your turn to buy them, that seems fair.  And yes you should think and not let a dog play with your gf‚Äôs things.  She sounds like a really careful person, I am too, and when people are careless like you are it irritates me and ultimately I have to keep those people at arms length because they just don‚Äôt seem to respect me or my stuff, it‚Äôs always just, ‚Äúwhoops stuff happens‚Äù /shrug.  When, you know, that stuff doesn‚Äôt ever seem to happen to me.."
"ive irrationally gotten angry at my boyfriend like this.

turned out i had to go get a blood test and was constantly suffering from fucked up blood sugar and now i have diabetes (and PCOS which is a hormonal condition as well as other stuff)

he had his shit going on too, but i tell ya.  irrational anger like this is not normal. "
"Yeah apparently he just needs to learn how to roll over and apologize for every petty little things she takes offense to.  It sounds like she just needs to assign blame whenever anything slightly wrong happens. And it's always easier to blame someone else that can take personal responsibility.

I think both parties need to learn how to communicate a hell of a lot better with each other. But I don't blame Op here for feeling like he's always being blamed for every little thing that goes wrong even when she was just as responsible for the problem is he is."
"To clarify: I never said those words, nor did I raise my voice at her. I simply said sorry and then I said in a clam, deliberate way that: the product is still good, and the box still holds all of the product just fine.

Neither of the things he described doing sound the least bit annoying.

> No, no. Do not tell someone they are irrational for being upset with you. She told you she was upset, she told you why, and you turned it around on her. You do not get to decide if someone's feelings are 'valid' enough for you to concern yourself with or apologize for.

I can recognize someone is upset, truly. But I think it is also recognizable that some responses are disproportionate to the event. We do this with children all the time. For example: if a child punches another child for taking his toy away. You both understand that the child is extremely upset. But we also explain that being upset to the point of physical assault is a disproportionate and thus unreasonable level of being upset about the event which occurred. No, I am not comparing my gf to a child it is simply a example. She *was* very upset about the box. Extremely. How is it not valid to point out the  level of anger directed was disproportionate to the event which occurred? Isn‚Äôt that what anger management is all about?

I now see explaining it logically and with reason is unhelpful. How, is it then, I should do it? Or should I simply accept that she will have anger management issues which supersede logic and reason because feelings are more important?
"
"> Your whole idea of trying to deal with someone who's upset by getting into a debate about why their feelings aren't logical is fundamentally misguided and self defeating. 

I agree. And I did apologize. And I was sorry. But I would also like advice on someway to avoid a disproportionate  emotive response by her to smaller issues if I cannot do it logically via reasoning "
"I‚Äôm venturing into guess work here, but she is extremely particular and extremely orderly. She also is very bossy with our dog and has admitted she was very bossy with her younger siblings growing up. I‚Äôm thinking it has some small part to do with the fact she had very strict (dare i say abusive) parenting and no self agency and therefore looking for control where she can have it. I think me opening the box wrong perhaps took that ability of hers to control her environment away from her "
Agreed. This guy is like a living nightmare to me. 
"You created a bigger conflict by invalidating her desire to open boxes properly and attempting to explain to her that she was wrong.

And you‚Äôre still doing it. Nobody could possibly be upset because you decided your way is superior to everybody else‚Äôs desires.

"
"To you.  Not everyone experiences the world the same way you do, though.  Whether something is annoying or not is very subjective."
"If this were a one time example, I would be on your side without a doubt. I *highly* doubt that this was the first time you've shown a lack of empathy.

""I now see explaining it logically and with reason is unhelpful. How, is it then, I should do it? Or should I simply accept that she will have anger management issues which supersede logic and reason because feelings are more important?""

No. This statement is *exactly* why you are having trouble. Being passive aggressive is not going to help. You think you're helping, but you are being a condescending jerk by treating her like a child. You said in your original post that you ""calmly and very slowly explained to her that I was sorry for opening the box incorrectly"". Consider the following two statements.

""Sorry I opened the box the wrong way. It really doesn't matter which way the box is opened. We can still get them out, no matter what way the box is opened. Why are you so angry? Calm down, you're over-exaggerating again."" 

""I'm sorry I opened the box on the side instead of the top part. I honestly didn't think there would be a difference. In the future, I will remember to open it on top.""

Which do you think is the less inflammatory statement? Which do you think shows her that you understand why she is upset, that you *care* about her feelings, and that you are making an effort to understand? Hint: It's the second one. You apologize for upsetting her, you explain why you did it, and you take care to make sure she knows you'll avoid doing stuff that you know upsets her.

You know, I honestly feel like you're accusing her of anger management issues because you want to be able to blame her for having emotions and absolve yourself of any responsibility in the situation. 

""Well, she's got anger issues, this is her problem. *I*, on the other hand, was logical. She just refused to accept my explanation and stop being angry for no reason. *I* didn't do anything wrong."" 

You really should see a couple's therapist so you both can learn to communicate. I would tell you to work with a personal therapist for yourself so you can start understanding how your behavior can affect others and to learn how to be more mindful of others.

Edited to add: I forgot to add this, but later, when the heat of the moment has passed, you can always sit down with her. ""Babe, I wanted to talk to you about yesterday. I wanted to explain my side to you. I really did not think there was an issue with how the box was opened. I didn't know why you were upset until you told me that the box cost extra to have that feature. I don't want you to think I'm wasting money, and I certainly don't want you to think I don't care. In the future, I would really appreciate it if you shared with me ahead of time that you'd prefer something done a specific way. If I do something in the moment that upsets you, please tell me how I upset you, so I can make things right."""
"In the moment: ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know that was important to you/that was the reason you did such and such. I won‚Äôt do it again‚Äù.  Or simply don‚Äôt respond in the moment. Your explanations are falling on deaf ears when she‚Äôs angry. 

Then when she‚Äôs not upset, tell her while you appreciate that she was upset, her reaction was not proportionate particularly as you did not deliberately do something to upset her. Explain that her anger is misplaced and hurtful. 

"
"Do they really supersede logic and reason, though?  You are very wedded to the view of ""I'm logical and she's irrational"".  Can you see that this, in itself, is an emotionally biased view?  

Let's look at it the other way.  ""My boyfriend tore open a box of cotton pads like a savage, and now it's all messed up and I can't close it neatly in a way that prevents pads from falling out.  He doesn't see that his action rendered the box unusable and aesthetically unpleasing, and goes into an instant emotional defensive reaction when called out on it, accusing me of being irrational and refusing to consider any of my reasons.""  "
"To be completely honest, I have never and would never be in a relationship with someone who acted like your girlfriend did in your two examples, so I have limited experience about how to address it. I will say that I strongly suspect that your reactions made those situation way worse than they would have been if you just aplogized for ripping the box, explained that you didn't know she cared, and dropped it.

Like I said, you are right that her reactions are over the top. You need to have a conversation about how you are acknowledging that when she tries to communicate that she's upset with you, it's not right of you to respond by trying to get into a debate about whether her feelings are valid, and you will stop doing that, but it's also a problem that when she is upset, her reaction is to come in hot and start making hurtful remarks and attacks on you and not want to listen when you try to communicate why you feel like those remarks are unfair, which is not acceptable either. This needs to be a conversation that occurs when everyone is calm and in a head space to have a reasonable discussion, not in the heat of the moment. "
"> I cannot do it logically via reasoning

Try empathy. "
"Don't start psychoanalysing her on top of your overall condescension and disrespect, for god's sake."
"Perhaps I did. However, surely we can agree that there is a gradient of issues which it is reasonable to be upset at in the first place. 

For example on the right end extreme: you punch someone. It is clearly reasonable for them to be upset at you. On the left extreme: you blinked and someone who doesn‚Äôt like blinking in their direction gets upset at you. 

I would put opening a box on the flaps on the side, versus the perforated top somewhere on the continuum of blinking, and punching someone. If we assign a value of 100 for punch. And assign a value of 0 for blinking. I would personally say the box opening is far closer to 0 than it is a 100

we all personally decide where in the continuum we would decide to create a conflict in the first place, and where in the continuum it is best to simply acknowledge that it is a trivial pursuit. Perhaps I really do get mad when people blink in my line of sight: but it is unreasonable for me to create a conflict over it. And In fact, perhaps it is something I would need to acknowledge that my emotive response is non-proportionate to the physical event "
"Thanks, I think a lot of what you‚Äôve said is something I should take into account"
I was asked a question. I answered the question. I also qualified my answer to said question by saying it was total guess work. 
"no offense but this shows that what's important to you is being right. you just sound like you have a very big ego and by trying to stay rational/bringing forth arguments you think you are clearly ""winning"", in the right, etc. it's not about who is right though.

aka I'm sure she knows the cotton balls are still fine. I'm sure she knows she can still use them. You don't need to explain it to her patiently like she's some stupid kid. You do that bc you think it's unimportant and you want her to agree to you. You say it's bc you want to show her the solution, but she's not asking for a solution. She only wants you to say I'm sorry, I didn't know it mattered to you which way I opened it, I'll make sure to open it properly next time. that's the end of it. but you feel like you need to show her the light of her illogical behaviour and turn it into an argument, then say it's totally her fault it's an argument bc it's an unimportant thing

basically what I'm saying is you say it's unimportant, and yet can't find it in you to let it slide and not get riled up about it / argue ""logically"" about how she should react / act now. why is that?"
"Are you actually comparing people blinking, an involuntary action, to you mindlessly opening a box incorrectly, something you did lazily and carelessly?

If your gf was posting this I‚Äôd advise her to leave because for you, your justice boner is more important to you than your gf‚Äôs relatively minor requests. You do not respect her, and as such you should not be in a relationship with her.

The question is whether you can respect anyone or if your self righteousness will destroy every relationship you ever have. "
"I think the user above is really onto something in terms of your reactions feeding it. It seems your gf has a pattern of pre-emptive striking. I don't know if she's always been this way, but at some point she came to expect that her feelings would be invalidated if she did not fight for them, so she comes out swinging. I struggle with this as well due to my mother, who thinks only the person who fights the hardest gets to have feelings. I've worked hard to control my reactions, but it's hard, and she'll need you to help break this style of reaction by deescalating and validating here. *Even if it seems silly to you*, just saying sorry anyway will help.

A person reacting to this pre-emptive strike with logic, explaining why something is insignificant, will fan these flames. It's not a healthy way for her to handle feelings of irritation/anger, but if you want to help by deescalating, a quick ""Sorry I wasn't aware how important that was to you. I'll do (insert ""proper"" thing here, like open it by the perforation) next time."" If she's feeling how I think she is, this will take her off guard and she'll realize how it's not actually important and she'll stop being upset. Eventually, she'll stop feeling so defensive to start with."
[removed]
"I wasn‚Äôt comparing. I put blinking at the far left of a continuum with a value of 0 and punching in the far right end of a continuum with a value of 100. Within those two extremes is a infinite number of values ranging from 0 to 100. Opening the box was somewhere in that continuum, closer to the left end of the spectrum versus the right. As you move from one end of the gradient to the other, justified anger is more and more relevant "

You seem to have zero emotional intelligence. What you don‚Äôt seem to realize is that the box ceases to become an issue entirely the moment you commit to opening it the way she wants next time.

"No-fault divorce in the US.  The guy isn‚Äôt going to have to give OP more of anything because he‚Äôs been cheating.  OP, find an attorney. "
"If it happened how your boyfriend describes, then your brother raped your boyfriend. This is an incredibly serious allegation."
"> James claims Andrew came over to his home and seduced him while acting as if he was me. 

There's a name for this, and yes, it can happen to men. Ask James what he wants to do about this."
"Wow, if your twin actually managed to make him believe he was you, then that makes him a rapist. It‚Äôs a serious issue."
"I'm not sure what you should do about your relationship, but your brother committed a crime. "
um. i'm sorry. did i just read that your brother raped someone?
"No, you shouldn't forgive your brother, mainly because he hasn't apologized. Having sex with someone under false pretenses like that is assault."
This wasn‚Äôt cheating.  You brother raped your boyfriend.
Wow wow wow. Your brother has some seriously weird thoughts on being a good brother or general human being. 
"No you shouldn‚Äôt. There are some things that are unforgivable. 

The real question is do you work on your relationship with your brother. You need to figure that out "
"It's not abnormal per se, but it would be worth talking to your doctor about if it worries you."
"maybe talk to the doctor, check your hormon levels ect"
"I don't think it's abnormal, but if it's something that concerns you  you should talk to your doctor about it. They can give you a better understanding of what is happening a get some blood work if needed. "
"I was like that around your age. But it changed as I got older, into my late twenties. The peak around ovulation remained the same (except when I was on the pill), but the baseline went way up. And once I got into long term relationships the whole attraction thing worked differently anyway - it wasn‚Äôt so much about visual triggers of attraction for me. I would leave it a little while and see what happens. "
"22f here (probably relevant given the topic). Don't worry too much, I think this is quite normal. I also tend to find my self more attracted to men when I'm about to hit my period. This is very natural. It's not abnormal to have a low sex drive otherwise. It doesn't sound like you have a hormone imbalance, because there would probably be a lot more symptoms if that we're the case. Again if you are worried about it, go ahead and visit the Doctor.

 "
Leave. It sounds like he's cheating and gaslighting you. Love isn't enough on its own.
">he has confidence issues and he expressed them in a clumsy way


He expresses them by cheating? "
Leave it now. Don't turn back. 
"You already gave him a second chance. He blew it. The rough childhood doesn't matter. If he's self-aware enough to use that as an excuse for his behavior, he's self-aware enough to control his behavior. He just chooses not to. Regardless, if you want a monogamous relationship, the WHY of his cheating doesn't matter, because the simple fact is that he doesn't value monogamy. It takes more than love to have a healthy relationship. You also need to be compatible in a lot of ways. You two have incompatible ideas about monogamy, incompatible boundaries, incompatible communication styles (I'm trying to be neutral when talking about incompatibility, because often it's not that one person is right and one person is wrong, but just that they're not a good match for each other, but really the ""incompatible communication styles you two have is mostly due to the fact that he communicates by lying and gaslighting), incompatible values, etc. Even if you love him, you can never have a healthy relationship with him, because there are too many deep and fundamental incompatibilities, too many and too deep to be resolved with compromise."
Break up. Don't take him back.
"Hmm there isn't enough information. 

But re-reading what you said, this is the issue here 

\> When we talked about it, he accused me of being paranoid.

Yes you are a little paranoid but that's ok because of what he did before. He on the other hand didn't give any viable explanation. "
"If you really want to make a go of things with him, you‚Äôve got to get the trust back. Whether it was one lie or ongoing lies, he‚Äôs got to stop lying and come clean about what‚Äôs going on and the motivation around it. Maybe he likes the thrill, the attention he gets from flirting. Maybe he‚Äôs not entirely happy with you. Whatever the case, the lies need to stop, even if the truth hurts you. 

For that to happen, he‚Äôs got to trust you - trust that he can be open and honest and you‚Äôll listen. Clearly cheating isn‚Äôt ok, but for a relationship to work, you both need to give each other safe spaces to be honest. 

It‚Äôs quite possible he‚Äôs not a good person and cheating is ok with him. It‚Äôs also possible he made some bad decisions for reasons that are more complicated than him just being a bad guy. If you care about the relationship, then at least give him a chance to express what made him search out other options. Don‚Äôt yell or accuse or judge - just ask him what‚Äôs going on so you can see if you can fix it together. 

Many good people have cheated - it doesn‚Äôt inherently mean they‚Äôre bad people. Give him a chance to talk it through with you - you may be surprised. As a reformed cheater, I can tell you the reasons for it happening can be complicated. Doesn‚Äôt mean you should stay, but it might be worth a try if you really care about him. "
By seeking attention. He had a diffucult childhood 
"I agree with you, especially communication style, he has some serious communication issues. 
"
"Some context: we used to work together, this coworker seeks so much attention and talks to him alot and in a flirty way. We told her that we are in a relationship but it didn't stop her from being flirty, I expressed how this bothered me. Weeks after, he deleted the conversation. "
" May I ask you why did you cheat ? Was it a one off or more than once ? 

"
That's not an acceptable way of seeking attention if you want to maintain a monogamous relationship. Maybe getting broken up over that will teach him that lesson for the future.
Yeah not an excuse to cheat on your partner and then lie about another conversation. Don't allow yourself to be mistreated because you think you can fix his problems.
"Hmm.

I think its time to get your ""I'm single and ready to mingle"" wardrobe out and about. :P"
"Sure, you can ask me anything. 

For some background, I‚Äôm 51 and have been with my husband since I was 20. We have three kids and a business together. He‚Äôs the love of my life and I never even looked at another man until a few years ago. So our situation is a little different - we had 27 years of goodness in the back before I cheated. 

"
"I started seeing other men out of curiosity, I wanted to explore my sexuality, and I liked the attention. 

I cheated quite a bit and still have a little trouble being honest, but we‚Äôve worked really hard to understand why it‚Äôs happening and the damage it causes, even though I lied to protect him. But the lying caused the damage, not the sex so much, which took me a long time to understand. 

We‚Äôre now working on an open relationship, which is really hard, but we‚Äôre committed to making it work. "
Problem : None of my clothes say I'm single and ready to mingle haha 
"Meh, not a big deal. Cut some holes in jeans. Grab a tattoo or two. Go to Forever 21 and grab a tank-top.........and you're golden. 

PS: JOKING, in case people don't get it. "
Don‚Äôt forget a super cute choker and lip gloss! 
and all the glitter the world can afford. (OK that may be too much. :P)
"You can send her a gift - she's going through something hard even if he hasn't passed away yet. The weeks leading up to my dad's death (he also had cancer) were absolutely miserable. We were in the hospital all the time- exhausted and grieving and watching this person you love so much just waste away in pain- just waiting for it to be over. Horrible. I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy.

Maybe a gift card for something local to her that you know she likes- starbucks or ice cream or a spa-type store. Some way she can get a treat or pick-me-up when she needs it and when she has time. 

You can also let her know you're available on her terms. Let her lead the conversations. She may want you to distract her- she may want to vent, she may want to remember her dad. Don't try and make her talk about things you think she *should* talk about and don't try to fix this for her- just be there to listen and enter that space with her. "
How close are you? Does she need plants watered or fish fed while she is away? Could you make a bunch of frozen meals for her to have to heat up when she gets back home? 
"If it were me, I'd send her a book you know she'd love, along with a card telling her you are here for her. 

Sitting by the bed or in the waiting room makes for some long hours. 

Also maybe some snacks and puzzle magazines to share with family members. 

That's what we appreciated when my husband's parents were dying. 

"
"Great idea! You‚Äôre a good friend. Bath stuff is great. Gift cards so she won‚Äôt have to cook, or can go to the grocery store are good too. Anything that will take a small burden off of her so she can have more time with her dad, or alloes her a chance to relax. "
"Food! I work in a hospital and I always feel so bad for the families who desperately want to stay with their loved one but don‚Äôt want to eat the gross hospital food. Make some casseroles/easy to heat up food and bring it to your friend and their family. 

"
"Another thing that you can do outside of a gift is set up a meal train when her father does pass. Just through meal train dot com, you can put it out to mutual friends on social media or via email and people can sign up for days to provide meals for the first few weeks/month after when they‚Äôre dealing with a ton of other stuff and the last thing they want to do/have time to do is go grocery shopping and put meals together."
"Relaxing things like bath stuff are a good idea, I wouldn't have wanted a voucher for a spa or something when I was in that position because I just didn't have the time to use it until weeks later. You want something that she can use now really.

I had a gel eye mask that you could cool in the fridge and it was lovely when my eyes were tired from long days and crying.

One of our friends gave my mum a notebook that had different questions on the pages you could fill in (like what's your favourite day, who's your role model?) which was nice a nice thing to do and chat about mum's favourite things. It depends how he is though, but a thing they can do together would be nice. There's only so much you can do in a hospital room.

Maybe something for her to fill time when sitting waiting or while he's sleeping. A book (try to find something light and safe from dad-heavy storylines. I did fine with a book that discussed a character going to his mums funeral but I struggled with ""happier"" things about mum's being nice), an amazon voucher to download something to watch, a nice notebook and pen if she likes writing etc.

The absolute number one thing is asking if there's little jobs she needs done. My flatmate watering my plants and checking my post for important stuff meant a lot more than her sending me flowers.

Definitely don't feel like you have to wait. For me the last two weeks my mum was alive were a lot harder than the two weeks after, but people didn't kick in with support in the same way until then. "
"Sorry to hear about your friends situation.

Food is so important during this process, trying baking food that is easy to heat up plus a few books."
Thank you 
She clearly still likes him. She didn‚Äôt conveniently stop when y‚Äôall started dating. 
"This is triangulating due to jealousy.

This is your new boyfriend‚Äôs issue with a very long term friend of the opposite sex. Not your issue. 

You‚Äôve advised him. If he continues being available for pictures that‚Äôs up to him. 

You‚Äôve advised her you don‚Äôt want to share personal information about the boyfriends. Stick to it and change the subject when she brings it up. 

That about covers the boundaries in question. 
"
"In the first place your boyfriend should talk to her about boundaries. See how that disscusion turnes out before you do anthing more drastic, but honestly this sounds super weird to me. "
"It's ok to say: Jane, can I ask you something? I've been thinking about something for a while, and since I don't get it, I wanted to talk so I can understand and not just assume anything. Can you tell me why you screenshot Jack and save pics of him? It's not something everyone does, so I wondered why, and what you use them for, and WHY DOESNT JACK KNOW? Because see, once I figured out he didn't know, that made me uncomfortable enough to come ask you. "
"This is really creepy, I'd advise cutting off the friend."
"speaking from a legal perspective, it depends where the photos were taken, if they were taken *from* public property then it's perfectly legal, otherwise it could be seen as invasion of privacy. I recommend you talk to the person who has them about removing them, ask them why they were taking them and what they are using them for."
"This reminds me of a girl who had a crush on my bf before I dated him. She‚Äôd always ask him about me once she knew we were dating and added me on a bunch of social media which was weird. She would talk about how cute we were but was all over him. I advised my bf that this girl probably has feelings for him and if he doesn‚Äôt want to lead her on, then distance is necessary. "
"Yes- thanks I wasn‚Äôt able to get back soon enough .

You‚Äôve been brought into a triangle. This has nothing to do with age and experience either. I dealt with it recently with people in their 40s and 50s! You‚Äôve done what you felt was appropriate - now step out of the triangle and don‚Äôt be used by either of them. He could have created the throwaway. He could stop being available for pics. The truth is he likes the attention and is feigning his aversion to attention. It‚Äôs up to him - now that you know he knows- to handle this the way he wants to. 
Don‚Äôt left them re-engage you- this becomes complicated and problematic. Some people love drama and intrigue, some people love honesty and doing healthy things for fun instead. "
"I agree it's suspicious and it seems to be quite obvious when I lay it out like this. But her behaviour has genuinely changed since we started dating. It's gone from 'don't talk to me about how much you like him or any of your interractions because it upsets me' to 'tell me all the cute stuff' and showing general support.

Even if she likes him, it's not an excuse. I just don't know how to deal with it."
"Sorry if I'm being dumb, but who is the jealous one? I told him because I think he has a right to know, and I talked it through with a good friend first who advised me to tell him. The alternative would be to keep him in the dark and I feel extremely guilty doing that. I'm not saying I'm doing everything right but this wasn't fuelled by jealousy on my part.

I agree that it's mostly his issue; it's his privacy that has been violated. However, I am also involved to some extent. He asked me to post this, but I am not writing on his behalf and I don't want to put words in his mouth, which is why this is focussing on my opinion and view of things.

I also haven't actually given him any advice. I've told him what's happening, I told him that I don't think there's any malice in it, and I said that if he wanted to confront the issue I felt he should tread carefully but that it was 100% his decision whether he wanted to do so and I wasn't trying to dissuade him from it. I'm not trying to push him one way or the other and he doesn't know what to do. He wants advice.

I'll definitely try and stand my ground when she brings things up, it's not worked so far though aha. Thanks though! :)"
"Excellent advice, thank you. :)"
"They are taken on video calls from when he's at home, she's not following him or anything. Talking to her about it is a good idea, it's just difficult knowing how to approach it."
Why would you even blame him for his friend secretly keeping a creepy stockpile of screenshots of him?
"That's because she wants to live vicariously through your relationship with him. She's also probably wanting you to feel close enough to her that you will tell her any relationship issues you have so she can use them against you. You both need to do a slow fade on her, give short responses to texts, answer facetime calls/regular calls with ""sorry I'm busy now"". She is not a friend to the relationship, so boundaries need to be established right away."
"You‚Äôre not the jealous one, your boyfriend‚Äôs friend is."
"Hey maybe been there done that? 
But it didn‚Äôt occur to you. 

Yeah the ‚Äòjust friend‚Äô turned stalker on a smear campaign that vied to be my replacement as a full fledged  other woman did just that. 
Some people are accidents waiting to happen. They lure you in and have plausible deniability as they dismantle your life. 

Just presenting more possible factors than were ever presented to me. Not saying that‚Äôs what will happen, but it can happen. 

If you see someone close to the edge - decent people pull you back in. 

My ex loved the attention- it intensified his craving for triangulation and he just got worse from there. Like an addiction - a positive feedback cycle that could not be broken until I left...
And he‚Äôs still creating drama and triangulation. "
"Ohh okay, thank you for clarifying! :) To be honest I was feeling overprotective as I was worried that getting involved in the situation would cause a rift in their friendship, and that it could be interpreted as me trying to stop them from talking.

edit: Just realised you're not OP oops aha"
"""Hey maybe been there done that? But it didn‚Äôt occur to you.""

The sample size of your life experiences is insignificant compared to how many people and personalities there are. You've met a few assholes and feel like an expert thanks to it, but you are not.

In fact here you are so blinded by your own experiences that you are incapable of reading into someone else's. And you are blaming the guy for being the target of creepy actions

In that case, the guy was not even aware of the photos being taken, how can you say he enjoyed something he didn't even know about. And when he found out about it he understandably found it disturbing. OP didn't say he tried to validate her friend's actions in any way, on the contrary, they both seek advice on how to proceed."
What are you talking about? Your the OP.
"Sigh. Breathe for a moment - reread. 
I never claimed to be an expert. I was offering other perspectives based on personal experience that I wish someone had shared with me. It can be taken or left, but better have it and not need it than need it and not have it. 
We are fortunate you are here to guard the gate and be your brother‚Äôs keeper and official arbiter (I‚Äôll wait while you look it up...) of right and wrong. That rushing sound is the collective sigh of relief that you are here to restore order. "
OP of the first comment
"You started the aggressive tone, don't do that if you can't handle a response. I maintain that you overlooked several points in OP's post and that you gave a bad advice for this situation."
He's not your friend and the crush isn't mutual. He just wants to bang.
He is not hard to read. He is trying to have sex with you.
I don't see how this is a mutual crush. The dude nearly sexually assaulted you. Get out of that situation ASAP.
"Learning experience - and this is important. If you don't want to have sex with a guy you barely know, don't share a bed. It's not that you did anything wrong, but you need to protect yourself. You can't put yourself in dangerous positions with people who have not earned your trust (and who have in fact proved themselves to be beneath your trust), especially if there is alcohol involved. 

You wouldn't meet a drunk at the bus stop and expect to share a peaceful night's sleep together. It is tremendously naive to think that you're going to platonically share a bed with a DRUNK near-stranger who is attracted to you.

As for the advice you're after... Do not feel bad. You can accept his apology and still not be interested in him and he'll just have to accept it. His personal problems are not your responsibility, only your SAFETY is your responsibility."
"Yeah this guy literally just sees you as a potential lay. He doesn't actually respect you, otherwise he would have taken no as an answer the first time. He's bad news."
"Dude. Get out of there. No contact - good job you're moving state soon! Honestly, you'll forget about this bloke as soon as you move away. Please don't make a mistake."
yeah I 2nd this - I had a similar situation happen to me a few years ago and it was extremely uncomfortable and hard to get past for me emotionally 
"I kind of agree with this, but I wouldn‚Äôt say she barely knows him. they worked together for a little while and have hung out a few times before then - I don‚Äôt think sharing a bed should have necessarily meant ‚Äúwe are having sex‚Äù. "
"Agree to disagree about how well she knew or could have known this guy. 

About the bed...I don't think it 'should' mean that, but come on. You're on a date, you're drunk, you agree to 'go to bed.' We aren't children. Expecting a sleepover in that context is just naive."
"Speaking as a man, this is a gross overreaction. For him to break up with you over something as trivial as a text speaks to a much larger issue, in my opinion. It seems he may have secretly been looking for a way out and this innocuous issue was his way to conjure up an argument and exit without being the bad guy. The ironic double standard is what is puzzling me as he breaks up with you for not communicating, but then blocks your number as to not allow you to communicate. There's something much larger at play here."
"Be grateful you are free of this jerk?

That is a giant insecure overreaction on his part. What a child. 

It's FINE if he wants more contact via text. That is something an adult can ask for and a couple can work on. Instead he dumped you. Which really is a good thing. He flips out this much over one text not being responded too, imagine what he'll be like with real struggle or challenge shows up in life. "
"He seemed to be overreacting a lot! If he was that concerned for you, he could have sent you another text, or called. Just be glad to be rid of such a controlling bastard. "
"You're free. Embrace it. This guy is WAY too controlling. You weren't in the wrong here, and even if he had badly wanted to speak with you, the correct way to handle it would've been to say, ""Oh, I wish you would've texted me anyway,"" and then to go on with life. Do not let his temper tantrum fool you into thinking you screwed up or that he's some prize you ought to try to get back. Walk away with your head held high. "
"Angry projection while being unreasonable? My guess is he is probably cheating! anyone who suggests someone ELSE is being shady is usually doing it themselves.

dodged bullet"
I think you‚Äôre right. Especially when he said I was being shady I got the feeling he was projecting what he‚Äôs been up to
"I did ask why he didn‚Äôt text me during that time and he said he was busy working, go figure lol"
"Precisely, that's typical guilty behavior: to project what you're doing behind someone's back onto them. You didn't mention any trust issues in the relationship in which you violated his trust, so why would he automatically jump to that conclusion & accuse you of shady behavior? Go with your gut on this one as you weren't wrong. Could you have texted? Yes, but you admitted that and, in my opinion, had a highly feasible reason for not texting and not thinking it would be an issue when you didn't. It's his overblown reaction that is truly telling in all of this though."
"There has been some trust issues in the past bc of choices he made, hanging out with other girls and not telling me. My gut is saying it‚Äôs happening again :("
"Unfortunately, that new info you shared absolutely paints a more stark picture of what's truly going on. He's definitely projecting onto you and your intuition probably isn't wrong on this. However, that doesn't make it easier to deal with and accept so I'm sorry :("
I don't think it's lack of remorse. I think he's protecting himself from guilt because he is a coward. It's easier to do something bad and convince yourself it wasn't bad than it is to take accountability. It's why he will always be a child and you are so lucky you don't have to know him anymore. 
"He's just projecting trying to make the world conform to his beliefs, rather then think of himself as a bad guy. 

Anytime someone makes a post such as ""Had awesome relationship for 5 years, then my partner cheated on me. I can't fathom staying in this relationship anymore and want out"" - you will have a bunch of people come in trying to say things like ""Maybe you should look at yourself, why did the person feel the need to cheat?"" And also things like ""Don't break up, it was just sex, how can you love someone so much they just because they sleep with someone else suddenly they are a bad person?"". - It's just people projecting, they don't want to see other poeple saying ""yeah! dump them!"" because of a fear that if they cheated and couldnt help themselves, that their partner would leave them.

My advice to you is to stop reading his posts, its not going to help you in any way.. "
Do you really expect someone who cheats to have enough morality to say it's wrong and to not do it? The guy clearly doesn't think being a decent person is valuable so I wouldn't put stock into anything he says. He probably gets downvoted lol
Stop caring about what your ex of a year ago is doing or saying. You just need to move on.
He's just trying to make himself feel better. Rationalization at its finest. Don't worry about it.
"Cheating is shitty behaviour, most reasonable people agree on that. And the fact that some people defend their shitty behaviour isn‚Äôt (sadly) so surprising. 

However, he‚Äôs your ex. You dodged that bullet. While it‚Äôs understandable that he‚Äôs given you a long term fear of being cheated on, it‚Äôs not so understandable that you‚Äôre still scouring Reddit for his comments. Let him fade into the past and forget about his dishonest, cheating ass. "
"Stop paying attention to what he is doing, problem solved. "
"Your ex is a loser who is just trying to convince himself of some bullshit to make himself feel better about being a piece of shit. 

It sucks that people like him make this world a worse place to be. But at the end of the day its just him being a chickenshit, he know what kind of loser he is. 

He isn't worth your time, he's not worth anyone's time. He knows it too. "
There is a whole sub out there for cheaters. I saw it once and all the shitty things going on where people encouraged each other to be unfaithful and I exploded in a comment and got banned. Whoops. I seriously can‚Äôt believe there are people like that. Makes me sick for their partners.
"The beautiful thing about breakups is the bullshit coming out of his stinking mouth is no longer your problem! Every time you see him post, use it as an opportunity to thank whatever you believe in that you no longer need to deal with him, and that he advertises his position so thoroughly that he's warning other women off him as well."
"There's a reason he's an ex, right? Why do you care what he thinks and says? It sounds like you're trying to psych yourself up to call him out and engage, with some idea that you'll put him in his place and reveal to the world what a worm he is, but really, all you'll do is stir drama with someone you should forget about. You're letting him take up space in your head, rent-free. It's hurting you, not him. If this is his attitude towards life and relationships, it will catch up to him, without any need for input on your part."
"This is a person with no integrity - as in no honesty, loyalty, or trust. There are more people out there like him, but there are also people with integrity who won't lie and cheat. I suggest you date the latter. "
"Discovering his posts should be validating for you. You recognized that he does not have good pots as a mate, so you ditched him. Now, a year later, you have confirmation that you are capable of identifying losers and limiting your exposure to them. 

And that‚Äôs the trust you need to keep reinforcing: trust in yourself to distinguish between a good boyfriend and a bad boyfriend, and trust in yourself to walk away from the bad ones."
"I wouldn‚Äôt sweat it. If he‚Äôs saying things like that, it makes it clear he‚Äôs a shitstain anyway. Even if he doesn‚Äôt realize it, or does and doesn‚Äôt have the courage to own it. "
"I was in a serious relationship with a...ha. A similar guy.

You know what he posted on Reddit? ""I always jerk off before an important decision or a date. If I still think it's a good idea or if I like the person, then I know it wasn't just a sexual thing.""

Wish he had jerked off before trying to cheat on me for a year.

That was the moment I was able to realize he was garbage and nothing he had to say matters. Your ex is similar. Don't worry about him. He can be miserable by himself."
Why are you still stalking him? It makes one wonder what do you do with your life if all you do is stalk him or others. 
This post will embarass you if he finds it. 
"Wow, I feel sorry for you. 

I mean, if he gave up on his impulse/needs, I hope he wears diapers. Because when he needs to poop, he gives in instantly. That's what you said."
...Thank you for this. That makes sense.
"I came here to say this exact same thing. OP, even if this doesn‚Äôt make you feel better, this is exactly why he is doing it. I would say that defending cheating like that doesn‚Äôt make him a coward per say, just that he‚Äôs stuck in a very common defense mechanism. I‚Äôm definitely not sticking up for him, I certainly agree with your comment, I just wouldn‚Äôt call him cowardly for this sort of defense mechanism that I‚Äôm very sure he‚Äôs completely unaware of.... but I‚Äôd definitely call him some other names, haha. "
Well said. Definitely something to keep in mind. Thanks :)
"> ""It's just people projecting, they don't want to see other poeple saying ""yeah! dump them!"" because of a fear that if they cheated and couldnt help themselves, that their partner would leave them.""

This is exactly why so many people throw a fit over the ""break up"" advice given here. They identify with unhealthy, selfish behaviour and they know if their own partner was to post here about them, they'd be advised to dump them so it's in their own best interests (not the OP's or their partners, of course, but what do they matter??) to discredit that advice as much as they can."
"I also don't think it's healthy to constantly wonder what you're doing wrong to make them do it, if the person already isn't giving you the baseline of being honest. They are never giving you the opportunity of fixing the problem because you will never really know what it is that is so wrong with you. Or be lulled into false sense of security and then they just do it again. I hate this kind of advice... No one is a mind reader and it's useless with someone who won't communicate or put themselves out there. 
"
I know right. So weird when people do this.
"The post clearly says she was scrolling through reddit and recognized his name, but nonononono you're right shes totally stalking him.

Twat."
"Of course. People who deny themselves accountability never find love, he's his own karma. "
"At one point I considered posting my relationship issues here but decided against it because I knew if I did I works just get a resounding chorus of ""dump him"" advice.

In hindsight I totally should have, I would have been happier getting out of a toxic relationship instead of letting it drag on. In most of the threads where I see choruses of breakup advice it's because they're fundamentally incompatible but still holding onto ""what if's""."
"I mean, I think it‚Äôs partially because so many people are so quick to give that shitty advice. Breaking up is the easy way out *a lot* of the time with posts here. If everyone listened to that advice every time it‚Äôs posted, there would be few successful futures from posts here. Working on hard things takes work - it‚Äôs easier to throw in the towel. 

But in this case I agree with you. Projecting like OPs ex is doing is obvious and sad. Cheating can‚Äôt be defended as a good or loving choice and it seems he can‚Äôt accept his behavior so indulges online to feel better. "
"Why can't she just skip his views and continue scrolling? It's not like she's forced to read what he has to say.... That's all
"
"But also the issue is that when people post, this subreddit only sees one side of the story. I bet every relationship would look bad if only the negative aspects of one person were revealed."
"I mean absolutely, i agree there are so many people quick to say 'break up!' but, that doesnt mean that it often isnt demonstrably the right thing to do"
"I guess it depends on the thread! A lot of the ones I see it is definitely not the right ‚Äúfirst decision‚Äù that it is offered as - and makes it seem like no one *works* through things anymore, and just drops them. 


But there are also tons of cut and dry ‚Äúdude just be done!‚Äù situations, I agree!"
"To be fair, people in healthy, happy relationships won't post here a lot. Either because their problems aren't quite as complicated, or because they have the tools to work through them on their own. I've never heard/read so many stories about abuse before I started reading here."
"I would say about 75% of the situations on this subreddit can be described with one saying. ""You can't make good wine out of bad grapes."" A lot of people wast time holding on to relationships that were doomed from the start. 

They persist because they hear that relationships are hard. Which is true. Even with the perfect person, relationships are still tough. But it is never up to you to fix another person in a relationship. Sometimes the best thing you can do for them is to break things off so that they can get serious about getting the personal, emotional, financial, or relationship help they need to better for the next person."
"D doesn't like you and doesn't want to be your friend. I would go low contact and avoid spending time with him. If you are good friends with his girlfriend, catch up with her alone instead of a group.

Your boyfriend reacted appropriately on your behalf. Unfortunately because they're business partners, this makes it complicated and you'll have to keep tolerating D... from a distance. 

However having known people like D, they tend to ruin their work/friendship groups/relationships eventually. I doubt this is going to be a forever problem for you and your BF."
"I  feel so, SO sorry for his girlfriend!  He's clearly a misogynist and an asshole all around.  Why is your boyfriend friends with him?"
"A person's friends are a reflection of who they are, and I would be really worried that this guy is your boyfriend's best friend. "
"I don‚Äôt think you are overreacting at all. What D did to you was incredibly mean. Considering it was your birthday and the mean stuff he said, I‚Äôm impressed you didn‚Äôt throw a drink in his face or something. Tbh I think you handled it well!!

I also think your BF has handled everything well so far! I would maybe bring up that D never apologized and decide how to navigate the friend/business partner situation together and what D and your bf‚Äôs relationship will look like from now on. It seems like your BF doesn‚Äôt want to be friends with D anymore but it may be hard to separate the business part immediately."
"Do you think your boyfriend would drop D completely and totally after treating you that way IF he wasn't so entwined business wise with him? If yes, then good! It's your BF's new job to shield you from D. D is no longer invited to social gatherings based on you or your BF. Your relationship with D's girlfriend may suffer at first but he's probably a huge jerk to her as well so hopfully their romance won't last. A business partnership isn't for forever. It may take a few years but this will be a fantastic way for you to learn to establish healthy boundaries with toxic people to protect yourself. And when you are inevitably in a conversation with D- short answers that do not invite more participation are fine. 

What I'm worried about is if your BF still wants to be friends with D because he feel bad for him. That's something you should also be careful about OP.  If your BF is willing to sweep this under the rug to maintain the status quo (i.e. you being abused) then run. 

Im sorry this dildozer ruined your birthday. He sounds like a miserable sack and I hope he gets what he deserves. "
Why are you having deep conversations about controversial topics with someone you never liked in the first place? 
"He's not gonna feel awful ever. If you're waiting for an apology you'll be waiting a long ass time. I guess your choices are either you move on, or you decide to cut contact with this jerk - which will be interesting given your boyfriend's contact with him.

Your boyfriend probably doesn't want to handle it further than he has unless he's willing to break up the business, which might be tricky if they've sunk everything into it and it's starting to pay off.

Maybe it's time to start having fun with jerk#1 and give it back to him. (I would. Note: I am not a nice person, don't do as I do unless you've thought about the consequences.)"
"He sounds like a real piece of work. However, you shouldn't let a rude person ruin your party. It's a real shame he's part of your social circle but it sounds like you weren't able to just ignore him and still enjoy the evening. I think that's something you need to work on.

It's 100% OK to not want D to join your social outings because of his repeated bad behaviour. You can't expect your bf to drop him since they run a business together but I would expect him to talk to D again, and/or also decide to socialise less with him until he learns to be respectful.

I wasn't there and I don't know if the discussion had gone this way at all but I've been involved in discussions where the other person resorted to name calling, crying not listening, and not being able to consider a rational argument and could only judge from their emotions. These people are exhausting and there's no point talking to them. I wouldn't call these people names but I can see how others may get to a point where they'd say 'no one cares' or 'that's stupid'. I'm not saying this is what happened, just that I can see how reasonable people can get to this point talking to certain people."
"You might be overreacting a little, but not much. As you‚Äôve said yourself, D is who he is, and so you need to get it in your head that everything he says is only like 70% serious. Because it is just not worth taking him 100% seriously. You can build up your own filter for him in your brain. And if he is ever upsetting you, you can withdraw from the conversation. You don‚Äôt owe him your ear at all.

I think in the future, D isn‚Äôt invited to events that are about you. Certainly not your birthday. He doesn‚Äôt get to be a default invite to all group activities. But he is close to your boyfriend so you are going to have to deal with him. Be polite but distant. Stick to pleasantries. If he tried to engage you in a controversial topic say something neutral to dismiss him. Strike up a convo with his girlfriend that he isn‚Äôt interested in. You can keep him at arm‚Äôs reach. "
I get the feeling that D will screw over your bf the first chance he gets
">Am I wrong to expect my boyfriend to stop being friends with him and keep their relationship business only?

Yes but I understand the feeling. Your boyfriend did react appropriately to the situation and did defend you, which is a good sign. However, his decision to be friend's with D is his decision and should not be pressured either way. 

However, explain to your boyfriend that you're really uncomfortable being around D socially anymore. He was extremely disrespectful and given D's personality, will likely continue to treat you disrespectfully when it suits him. That its best for you to limit time with him. If you do have to spend time with him on a business level or for a social event (like boyfriend's birthday party), treat him civilly but immediately move on to socializing with someone else. He may kick up a fuss and call you immature but don't engage. Just simply shrug it off and go back to socializing with someone else or leave (whichever you feel comfortable with in the moment). Look up JADE, this may help you interacting with him going forward. "
"If I were your bf, I‚Äôd let D know that I‚Äôm keeping you away from him since he both can‚Äôt be civil and can‚Äôt be trusted to do what he said he‚Äôd do by way of apology. It sets a work boundary for him, and keeps you from being to blame for the awkwardness that comes next and let‚Äôs the two of you be a united front rather than putting him in the middle between you and D. 

Not that you can‚Äôt easily fight your own battle, but for practical purposes it makes things easier for him and also helps him set a boundary with an overbearing business partner. "
"Just remember that when someone is mean or rude to you for no reason, they're unhappy with themselves or painfully insecure. That is THEIR reality and has no reflection on you. It sucks that your bf can't part ways with D because of the business side, but I would strongly encourage the bf to change the parameters of this relationship strictly to work-only. Like it or not, who you surround yourself with and moreover who you befriend is a direct reflection of who you are. If bf won't let go of the friendship, you should really consider what that says about your boyfriend. And figure out from there if you want to be in a relationship with someone whose values allow for closeness to such a piece of shit in their lives."
Take off the gloves.  Tell him he is a pathetic small dicked piece of shit abuser and see how well he takes it.
Just have nothing to do with him anymore. Not everyone is nice or will be your friend or is worth having as a friend. Brush him off because ultimately he is not worth it and should not be responsible for your happiness.
"You need to stand up for yourself, you dont need anyone to defend you. When asked why you were crying say that you are feeling sorry that you bf has such a dumb ass friend."
">don‚Äôt even want to be in the same room as D anymore.

Then, don't. Your boyfriend understands how toxic and disrespectful D is. You and D's girlfriend can hang out separately, and you and your boyfriend can hang out, and he and D can have their work / friendship. But there is no reason at all for you to be in the same place as that piece of work. You shouldn't be doing the heavy lifting to find your self respect every time this sub-human erodes it. 

As to how to expect your boyfriend to handle this? He shouldn't have to, under the circumstances. It's not about him. You obviously respect him and understand why he - for now - is in a relationship with D. Give him the latitude to retain that relationship to the degree he wants to, as long as it doesn't impinge on your and his relationship. He will find his way away from D. If you can be supportive of boyfriend and D doing their thing, it will show your boyfriend how much you love, trust, and respect him. (Of course if it starts weighing on your relationship, have another conversation!) You and he sound like a really good match. Don't let D get in the way.

Best wishes! "
"Your boyfriend may have to keep being friends with him to maintain their professional relationship unfortunately. The way I see it, you have a few options here.

1. If he‚Äôs at an event, don‚Äôt go. If you‚Äôd like his girlfriend to come to an event, invite her and only her.

2. Continue going to events that he will be at, but ignore him. If he speaks to you, don‚Äôt respond. If he joins a conversation with you and someone else, continue talking to the other person but not him. It‚Äôll probably drive him crazy because it will make him feel rejected/disrespected, and he‚Äôll likely learn to stop interacting with you because he‚Äôll want to save face.

3. Be a bigger asshole to him than he is to you. When I was in a situation like this, I chose this route and, while not the most mature thing I‚Äôve ever done, it was honestly a lot of fun and really cathartic. I even started looking forward to being around the guy because he was so smug and it felt good to take him down a peg. My friend was dating a guy that constantly talked down to others and acted like everyone else was an idiot, including her and I (even though we‚Äôre both objectively more intelligent and well-educated than him), he was incredibly disrespectful and arrogant, and I disliked him more than I‚Äôve ever disliked anyone. I would go out of my way to talk about things I knew a lot about and that were objective and wait for him to engage in the conversation (and of course he would to try to prove me wrong), and I would make him look like a complete idiot by then proving him wrong and being incredibly condescending about it. I was also just generally rude to him and if he spoke to me at all, I made it very clear that it was annoying to me to even have to respond to him. Eventually, he actually started to be nice to me and I eased off. I guess for him, the only way to get respect was to treat him like shit and make it clear that his being rude to me had no effect on me. "
"I would just establish that you are never socializing with D again, no matter how inconvenient that is for your boyfriend. I guess he has to work with D unless they sell the business or whatever but you don't have to see him anymore. D won't apologize? Fine, D is dead to you now. Don't waste another second of your life in his presence. And your boyfriend needs to take you out for a makeup birthday celebration since his friend ruined yours. "
"  This sucks. You cannot control what D says or if your bf stays friends with him but you can keep controlling how you react. You may not avoid him 100&#37; bc your bf is friends and business partner with him.

  I know it is SO much easier said than done but in the future whatever he does say, let it bounce off of you like you do not care and only be cordial if you come in contact with him, other than that literally talk to/ pay attention to anyone/ anything besides him. Do not let him egg on. He clearly enjoys bullying people and see their reaction when he riles them up. Do not let him see that he is getting a reaction out of you. Hope you feel better! Do not let anyone ruin your day, ever!"
I personally think crying and storming out of a party (your own birthday) over your boyfriends friend being rude and bratty was an overreaction.  But a lot of people seem to think it wasn‚Äôt so just my two cents.

"D also doesnt reapect you. He thinks its funny or acceptable and probably gets a power trip from it. (My experience with people like him do, so im assuming.) 

Id say its boundary time. D is no longer welcome in your home. if he and bf have business to discuss, they can do it elsewhere. 

D is also not invited to social events until he apologizes fully. Not ""im sorry if i upset you"" 

1, apologizes and takes ownership. ""Im sorry *that* i did xyz""

2, acknowledges fully how he went wrong and details his plans to prevent it in the future.  

3, makes a plan and executes it to make up for the birthday that he ruined. 

Id also say to not expect any of it from him though. 

You do not owe him politeness, kindness or generosity. 

"
"I do too. She‚Äôs so sweet and he treats her how he treated me constantly. The worst part of it is they have a child together. My boyfriend and him have been friends since the beginning of high school when he was much different, as he‚Äôs gotten older his ego has just gotten completely out of control. It‚Äôs a good question why they‚Äôre still friends though. "
Where did you get he's a misogynist?
"This. If he's not willing to severely limit his contact with D, he's not the ma. For you OP."
"He is a huge jerk to her as well but unfortunately they have a child together so it‚Äôs unlikely they will split up. They‚Äôve been together since she got pregnant at 16. But you‚Äôre right, my bf is nothing like D, and has known he‚Äôs an ass for a long time and it‚Äôs already effected their relationship. Hoping this is the last straw. Thanks so much for the comment."
"I agree that it was a bit of an over reaction, however I left to avoid causing a scene. I could feel myself start to tear up at the table involuntarily (shoutout to hormones) so I left calmly and cried in private."
"He has always been extremely aware of that, however not only is D fiercely loyal to his friends they‚Äôve also recently incorporated their business so my boyfriend could take legal action against him if he tries anything shady. "
"I mean, if my boyfriend wouldn't drop a friend who treated me like that I would be gone"
"I agree with you. 

I hope OP tries a different approach. Speak up for yourself. 

As soon as anyone disrespects you like that, state straight up you don‚Äôt appreciate it. 

People only treat you the way you allow yourself to be treated. I would never want my spouse to tell someone they hurt my feelings. 

I‚Äôm a woman by the way. "
"I also think she just avoid him. If she knows he's a jerk and they don't get a long just don't talk to him, especially don't have controversial discussions with him. Also, I probably wouldn't have invited him in the first place."
My thoughts exactly. Why would you get into a hot-button topic on your birthday? I get the impression that the conversation escalated and both were probably not very cordial to each other. It sucks that someone interrupts and is rude but why engage?
[removed]
">They have a child together

NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO"
"When he referred to OP and his girlfriend as ""complaining bitches"""
Can confirm he is misogynistic as hell. One of the first times I met him years ago he asked me with a disgusted look on his face ‚Äúso you‚Äôre not like... a feminist are you?‚Äù which had absolutely nothing to do with what we were talking about. 
"Yup. If my boyfriend's best friend even tried to talk to me in a disrespectful way you best believe he'd have a talk with them demand they apologize, and if they don't remedy the situation they'd be cut off. Or at the very least he wouldn't bring them around me anymore.

A friend of my boyfriend's once made a ""joke"" saying I messaged him. My boyfriend asked me about it, confirmed it was a lie, and he promptly called his friend to tell him that he didn't appreciate those kinds of jokes and to leave me out of his pranks. He also said he wouldn't tolerate any kind of disrespect towards me or our relationship (this wasn't the fist incident, there had been another ""joke"" before). The friend immediately messaged me to apologize but my boyfriend still kept him at arms length after that.

Ops boyfriend should at the very least have asked D to apologize, and ideally severed the friendship or just not invite him around for her birthday celebration. He knows he's an ass, why did he think he'd be nice to her this time? "
"Don't be too sure about that. If he keeps this up then hopfully she'll run just as soon as she knows it's safe for her and her child to do so. You can help that along by maintaining supportive communication with her- within your boundaries of course, I wouldn't talk about anything D related in case it gets back to him. If she calls to vent then you can be a sounding board but otherwise it might be healthy to pretend that D is like a fictional villain. Hearing about how Captain Hook ruined Peter Pans day doesn't actually ruin yours- you know?"
"Yep. Everything's a choice.

>My (F23) boyfriends (M23) rude friend (M22) made me go home crying on my birthday

No one can ""make"" a person go home crying or do anything. It's a choice. OP should retake control of her reactions, whether they are emotional or otherwise. She will be much more empowered when she realizes she owns that, and not some doofy friend of her boyfriend. She gets to choose how to stand up to him, ignore him, or avoid him, as she sees fit. She's reasonably young, but she's got the bones for it. Also a woman. "
"So basically, cause a scene in other words. She was trying to minimize drama and this isn't helpful"
"Exactly! And I‚Äôm sure she ruined the night for everyone else there who came out and wanted to have fun and celebrate. She stormed off like a child. She should have excused herself, went to the bathroom, cried if she had to and pulled herself together and gone back and enjoyed her bday. If she wanted to explain to him how he made her feel she should 100% be the one to do it not her bf and sometimes just let it go or pull them aside at a better time. Having huge emotional outbursts isn‚Äôt cool.  Am also woman üññ"
That's what I say every time I see kids involved in posts here.
And when he dismisses her opinion and ignores her.
Maybe he says the same about men...
"He did ask D to apologize, which is when D swore up and down to my boyfriend he was going to talk to me today to straighten everything out, which he didn‚Äôt. He‚Äôs going to talk to him tomorrow again and is livid that he didn‚Äôt contact me. But you‚Äôre right, he shouldn‚Äôt have even been invited because this is definitely not the first time he‚Äôs acted like this towards me or other people. I honestly don‚Äôt even know why they‚Äôre friends because my boyfriend is nothing like D. "
"Huge emotional outburst?? It was the end of the night anyways, where I live bars close at 2 am and it was like 145. I left calmly and cried in private. I didn‚Äôt ruin the night for anyone by reacting like a human being for someone making me feel like total shit. "
"You must say it often ;) 

Op should be sure to not have kids for now. Wait until to see if D will stay around or  not. "
Oh phew. I was almost worried the person being contrary for no reason wouldn't show up. 
"Regardless, he is a piece of shit that treats women (and maybe men) like crap. What's your point? "
"I honestly feel like maybe your boyfriend is afraid burning the friendship will affect their business partnership. It's a tough position to be in.

But it's not unreasonable for you to request that he not be invited to future celebrations for you. And you have every right to refuse to go to gatherings where he will be. He sounds like a complete asshole"
why do you want an apology from someone you don't like or respect? they are friends probably because of the things they have in common. not their differences. i am of the opinion that someone you don't like or respect should be able to control your emotions especially with weak insults. a fuck you buddy would probably make you feel better than wondering why is he being so mean to meeeeeee.
well idk do you wanna try and feel better and more confident against assholes or do you wanna be consoled for being in the right?
"Still hella dramatic, if I was at the dinner I‚Äôd be rolling my eyes. Also given that you think this is totally normal I‚Äôm assuming this isn‚Äôt the only time you‚Äôve overreacted to something in a social setting. Again just my thoughts. "
"Op states he is awful with everyone. 
At no point she states he is acting like this only with women. "
"I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm not really understanding your logic. It would have been acceptable to excuse myself to go to the bathroom to calm down, but excusing myself and walking outside is being dramatic? As I previously stated it was the end of the night anyways, my friends left 5-10 minutes after I did. "
"Definitely have a chat with her. My husband and I knew each other online for several years before things developed, and we had to be LDR for a while. It wasn‚Äôt super pleasant, but it can be done, and this was back in the Stone Age of internet. We didn‚Äôt have smart phones, FaceTime, webcams, or even texting. I mean, some of those things were around, we just didn‚Äôt have them. üòÇ

Anyway, we were 18 and 20 when we started dating, and we‚Äôve been married for 11 years. If you‚Äôre both interested, go for it. It‚Äôs better to know than to always wonder."
"I‚Äôd talk to her about how she feels about the two of you and where she‚Äôs willing to go in terms of a relationship. Not gonna lie, LDR‚Äôs are really tough on a couple (not that it‚Äôs impossible) and a lot just don‚Äôt work out, so same people just don‚Äôt want to get into them. If you‚Äôre both willing though yay for you. Good luck man :)"
"I usually tell people not to go for it in situations like this. I think you should though. You've been friends for a long time and the very first time you saw each other in person, a little magic developed over the week. You'll see each other again, you just have to do some planning. I was in a LDR (honestly a pretty good experience, I don't regret it even though it was hard) and the best thing we did in order to keep the panic and blues away was plan our next visit before parting ways. Even if you don't buy tickets, make any concrete plans, and just pick a date (which can be moved) and start talking about what you want to do, it'll feel a lot less uncertain in the in between times. Good luck friend. "
"Sounds like you two care about eachother enough to consider being together in a tough situation like that. If you're gonna do it you have to do it all the way. How much time until one of you can move to be with the other? Are you both willing to wait that long? Gotta be careful, but I say go for it"
"Would just like to say that I have been reading all your messages. Sorry if you were expecting a response, this is my first time on a subreddit like this and the first time I've been open about something like this. 

You have all been very helpful. Given me a lot of hope for the future and I can safely say that I am going to go for it. I really do care for her and hope that one day the distance will no longer be an issue. Everything is going well so far and I hope it continues. I appreciate all your feedback.

Especially to the comments who say they have gone through something similar and lived happily ever after and to the ones who are telling me to just go for it. Thank you."
"I'd say keep talking until you visit her again. I dunno where you live, but flights from London to Oslo are quite cheap, so you could explore the possibility of a serious relationship by all means. 

It's possible for both Englishmen and Norwegians to live and work in each country - as far as brexit doesn't mess things up too much, so there are options for you. 

It's quite common for young people from nordic countries to study in Scotland, maybe that could be a way for you to get some time to develop a relationship?"
Just be honest and discuss things with her. LDR can be hard because of the distance but things can still go and be great! I am currently engaged to my Fianc√© who lives in Germany while I live in Texas! And we are currently in the K-1 Visa process so we can legally get married. You could always Skype or chat through WhatsApp. Me and my Fianc√© Skype and play video games together and just enjoy each others company. I've been able to see him two times this year and last year 2 times as well. And  like I said LDR is possible if you truly care for the person you want to be with!
"I'd say go for it. Talk about how you feel for each other, and try to keep contact through the internet as much as you can.  
I met my SO in a forum over nine years ago. We got together after around a year. Now we're married and living together! We did long distance for like seven, eight years before we could move in together, and it's hard, it's very difficult, but it can be oh so worth it. It was for me- I've never been happier in my life! You can do it. The internet services today do wonders for LDR. Best of luck!  
"
"The thing about long distance relationships is that you have to be really serious about it. If this is just a casual relationship, then don't bother. The end goal has to be marriage, because that's the easiest way to immigrate.  I'm not entirely certain what the rules are for your countries, but immigration in North America for non-refugees is extremely difficult and marriage is the only option unless you're in a STEM field. 


So if you think you can end up with this girl forever, then I'd say go for it. "
"Thanks, this really helps. There is hope :)"
"PR is part of the US. You wouldn't be moving to a different country, just a different landmass. But yeah, I get you, you're an adult and you don't want to move and your parents are putting all this annoying pressure on you. I'd suggest, when they bring it up again, telling them that you've already made your opinion on this clear and them bringing it up again just makes you not want to talk to them."
">there is no day that passes that my parents talk to me about me relocating on the states.

They can't have a one sided conversation. If they start talking about it, say ""If you don't drop the subject I'm leaving,"" and then actually leave."
"Well it‚Äôs isn‚Äôt another country, but I understand how it will feel that way.  You would have tons more opportunities if you look into coming to the mainland, especially being bilingual.   I imagine that once conditions improve in Puerto Rico, people will come back and the economy will improve.  Maybe you should have a deadline for staying, after that look into relocating.  "
">I know that the place I live is going through difficult economic time

So is the US. The job market these days is shit."
"You are 25. They don't have to support you. So if you don't want to move to the mainland (not a different country), then you need to do something where you can support yourself in PR. If you can't find a job where you can afford rent/bills, then maybe you should look at what your options really are."
"You don't need a concrete reason for not wanting to be with someone. I do think it would be nice if you could do it kindly as possible, and in person. You may both get upset,but stay firm and make it a clean break. It will make moving on for him and you easier. "
"So you do have a reason. You just don't wanna hurt his feelings. It's gonna hurt regardless, might as well be honest."
"Meet up in person, hopefully a neutral place (not one of your homes) and tell him, ""Hey, FWB. I've enjoyed the last 4 months with you, but I feel like this is starting to become more of a serious thing than I can have in my life, right now. I feel it's time to end this thing between us before one or both of us end up hurt. I wish you all the luck in the world.""

There is no painless way of breaking up with someone who cares about you; this IS going to hurt him. The best thing you can do is to be very clear that this is a ""you"" issue, and that you won't be changing your mind. Any glimmer of hope for a future relationship with you might lead him to try to wait for you, or try to argue you into staying, leading to even more hurt feelings for one or both of you."

why dont you want a relationship?
"Have you thought about talking to him about your concerns or fear of commitment?  From what I'm interpreting, you ARE really enjoying yourself but are afraid of getting hurt (""it's going too well"").  It sounds like you have something fun and special with someone for the first time!  Personally, I wouldn't just cut the cord.  I don't think you should keep this to yourself though.  Have an open and honest conversation with him about this."
"I know I don't technically need to give a reason, but I consider him such a close friend at this point that I just don't see how I can end this without offering some kind of explanation. And I feel like the only explanation I have is v. ambiguous and dumb"
Because she doesn't want one.
"That you no longer feel it, dont get energy from it and need to move on are fine reason.

Just remember if you mention anything involving him, then he can attempt to change, do things differently and youll be under pressire to give it another shot. Which doesnt sound as something you are after."
"You are not a jerk. They are being pushy, and slow to realize that favors aren't coming. Keep saying no."
"You are not a jerk. I had neighbors like  this and you are absolutely right that if you give an inch they will take a mile. I didn't give my neighbors a ride because that was the last thing they asked for when i said no in such a way that they knew i was DONE. It was my only day off that week. I worked 6 days and just wanted to relax on my day off. They knocked on my door FIVE TIMES asking to use my fuckin cell phone back when minutes were limited. They knew before they even asked for a ride that I was done because I was rolling my eyes as soon as I opened the damn door the 5th time.

You might actually want to stop answering your door. Just say you were busy when they inevitably ask, or say you were in the shower, napping, whatever. "
"You shouldn't feel bad about it, as the neighbours are pisstakers!

They are definitely the types to take a mile, so I would continue to say no.  Legitimately, you can say that you can't afford the running costs (fuel as well as maintenance).  if they say they'll give you money for fuel, then they can easily pay for a cab.

It isn't normal for neighbours to be giving everyone lifts everywhere, so you should stop feeling bad about it."
"The next time they ask for a ride, tell them no and to please stop asking for rides. I wouldn't give an explanation or justify it, just say ""no, I cannot give you a ride and I would appreciate it if you would please stop asking me to take you places."" I would make sure you tell the moms this too, not  the daughter. Say the same script when they ask you for things (like the bleach incident). 

Good on you for having a backbone though!! You are not a jerk, they are the ones being rude by consistently imposing themselves on you. If they're that desperate for a ride they can take the bus or call an Uber or Lyft. "
"Next time, be blunt with them. ‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt ask me for any more favors.‚Äù"
You're in the right here to say no. If you say yes they'll just ask for more and more just to use you. Don't feel bad. 
"Hey, I need to chime in here, because I've gone through similar situations.  You have to start just telling them no, and stick to it. Who asks someone they barely know to take their kids, in a car, somewhere away from them? No more excuses. Do not even accept gas money, because your time is valuable to you. It's not a two way street, where they are having you over for dinner, and helping you with different things, they just corner you and ask you for rides.  Just say, "" I cannot give you a ride."" They will ask you why not, and just say, ""Hey, I am sorry, but I don't know you really, and I am not giving you any more rides. I should not have done it in the first place, but I was put on the spot."" They may get pissy, just keep saying no. Don't explain anymore than that, don't bargain, nothing."
"I know some people like this. Trust me, you aren't the only person they ask things of. They wear out friends and neighbors, and if someone says no, they just move on to the next person. They feel entitled to being helped, and ask so many people for so much, that your ""no"" probably doesn't stick out to them too much. 

It's okay to be firmer. Don't answer, or tell them ""I cannot give rides to you. Please don't ask again.""

Some people only see others in terms of what they can get out of them. "
"It might be time for a definitive ""no, I don't have the time, money or motivation to do you any favours. If you continue to ask, I will start to think of this as harassment and take the proper steps to remedy this uncomfortable and unnecessary situation you are putting me in.""

Maybe involve your landlord as a precaution?"
"Say no and close your door on them, problem solved. Stop thinking about it and just do it. "
"Don‚Äôt feel bad at all! Just keep saying no. These type of people don‚Äôt feel bad about asking over and over, so they don‚Äôt mind hearing no over and over. I had a girl at work like this, I gave her an old pair of shoes
Once and after that she constantly asked for anything and everything. Once I lent her $5, just so every time I saw her, I‚Äôd ask her if she had that $5, it was a great investment, I never got the $5 back, but she avoided me and never asked me for anything ever again. "
"You're not a jerk, they are jerks. I am extremely happy to hear that you've been saying no. I hate to know you are left feeling bad about it. I especially hate that they keep asking despite being told no. Maybe next time, tell them no, and add something like ""and please stop asking me. Your requests for rides and to borrow things are frequent and unreasonable. I'm not in a position to help you. Please don't ask me again.""





Good luck. "
"hang a do not disturb sign on your door. If they knock ""oh, did you see the sign? Im in the middle of soemthing right now. Please dont knock if the sign is out."""
Why do you keep opening the door for them?
The next time they knock could you have one of your teenagers answer and tell them to piss off in no uncertain terms if you're worried about being confrontational yourself? The neighbors are clearly insane to think having been given a ride once or twice means they can ask you for rides and items all the time.
"Here's a idea, if they come asking for rides, give them a bus schedule and a phone dictionary for taxis and Uber/Lyft. "
"Do you have a peep hole? Don‚Äôt answer the door! My neighborhood constantly has solicitors and sketchy people. I don‚Äôt answer my door unless I know someone is coming over. I don‚Äôt feel bad about it for a second. These people obviously aren‚Äôt getting the hint. If they try to corner on your way in or out, tell them exactly what you told us and leave it at that. People like this will take a mile if you give them an inch. "
"DO NOT STOP SAYING NO TO THESE FREELOADERS!  You are perfectly in your rights to saying no to any request from anyone. 

You are not their personal taxi service. And what's even more galling is that they would probably not offer you money for gas. Print up some slips of paper with the url's of both Uber and Lyft.   Add a couple phone numbers for local taxi services if there are some in your area.  Hand them a slip each and every time they ask for a ride."
"You're feeling bad because you have a heart  and empathy... However this family sounds like boundary stompers and will not hesitate to take advantage of you if you ever say Yes :/ 

Anyways keep in mind that they don't feel one bit sorry about bothering you and asking you for favors when its clearly putting you in an uncomforatble position (like when you had the flu and they wanted you to chauffeur them)"
"Thank you for that. It's really nice to get someone outside your own head to validate you from time to time, you know?"
"Haha I was just thinking about this. We have a peephole and you can't get into my building without being buzzed in, so I know if someone knocks it's a neighbor. I should just start sneaking up to the door and check who it is before opening it. (I have two neighbors that are very close friends and sometimes they drop by). 

Your neighbors sound AWFUL. I honestly don't know how people have the chutzpah to do stuff like that. I'd be mortified if I had to knock to ask for a favor once, let alone five/six times!"
[removed]
Thank you. I just think of the help I've had from friends over the years and something in me feels bad for not paying it forward sometimes. But I have never in my life gone to neighbors I'm not friends with and repeatedly asked for things and I don't get how someone would be shameless enough to act this way.
"I agree, I definitely shouldn't get into details with them or justification.

They said yesterday it was for their grandmother's memorial service and I couldn't help thinking, ""why don't you just ask some of your family to pick you up on the way?"" but didn't say it out loud.

Plus the place they were going, it's not really a funeral service kind of area so I am not sure I believe them."
I was *just* thinking that after dreaming about this last night. 
"Thank you, I think so too but that guilty conscience my mom beat into me is hard to overcome."
That's what I have been doing. Just no. I'm not doing that. The fact that they keep trying is mind boggling to me. I'd be too mortified to ask again after being bluntly shot down the first time.
"Sadly I think you've hit the nail on the head with this. One of my close friend neighbors lives right across the hall from them, the door directly opposite. I'm going to have a chat with her about how much they're at her door, kind of get an idea of how pesty they are to other people."
I think the first sentence will work but I don't want to go further than that yet. Maybe if they continue after I tell them that I'm not going to be doing favors I'll get harsher. I don't want to go to the nuclear option except as a last resort.
"I've got the first part down, it's the second part that is hard. I'll try though. Thank you."
Hahaha that's amazing. A cheap solution to an aggravating problem!
"I may have to get to that point. I'm just grateful it's not a daily or even weekly thing, it's pretty infrequent. Yesterday was some kind of record, them coming twice in one day."
"Haha I think I grabbed one from the hotel we were in last year. I'll see if I can find it. Or I can get my younger kid to help me make one, he likes making things."
"Same reason some people feel like they have to answer the phone when it rings, I guess. Cultural conditioning in being ""nice"" which a lot of women get stuck with. Someone else mentioned just sneaking up to the door and seeing who it is before answering, which I'm going to do. Someone else mentioned getting my friend neighbors to knock in a specific way and I am going to implement that too.

edit: missing phrase"
"Probably not the best idea, we've got rules in place for being abusive to other tenants (as it's been a problem) and I wouldn't want to end up having to have a talk with management about my kids. I think I'm just going to go the passive route and be more careful checking who is knocking before answering the door going forward."
I may end up having to resort to that one of these days. haha
I do have a peep hole and I'm going to have to start sneaking to the door and checking who it is before answering from now on. It's kind of dark in the hall and my eyes aren't what they used to be but it's better than having to say no and then feel shitty about it for days afterward.
"I won't ever stop saying no, thank you."
I have that gut feeling they'd never stop if I gave them anything so I'm going to keep saying no and hope that someday they'll finally get the hint. Thank you.
"Oh, I totally understand. I have trouble myself saying no to favors like that. I am working on it, and have gotten much better. But still. Yoir neighbors need to handle their own shit."
"You are allowed to have boundaries. Next time any of them show up, tell them to leave you alone and that you will speak with the property manager about their behavior if they approach you again."
"Don't even sneak. Let them hear you walk up, check, and then walk silently away. "
Start asking the ones who are friends to use a particular knock maybe? Like a certain pattern they use so you know it's them?
They were terrible. I was so happy when they finally moved! My current neighbor is kind of a busy body and will ask for favors but she always emails and she's impatient as hell so if i just don't respond quickly enough she'll ask someone else. 
"Some people are just 'takers'.

If you continually give to people, then at some stage you will run out of resources/energy to your own detriment.  There's a reason why on planes they say put on your own oxygen mask first - it's no good if you help someone else out and die yourself!  You need to keep yourself alive too!"
"It's a weird part of human psychology, but ironically enough our brain places higher value on people we've done favors for. That could be why you feel guilty about it even though you did nothing to feel guilty for. "
"Think of it this way, you are paying it forward to your own kids by keeping your car in working order and making sure you don't wear yourself out. "
"I have, I kid you not, been driving down the street in my (at the time) forty year old pick up truck to work, and had strangers ask me for rides as I rolled by them at a stop sign.  My grandmother had random people knocking on her door in the middle of the night, several times, asking for rides. It's not something I experience in suburbia, ever, but when I lived in a trailer park, it happened fairly often. It's weird and creepy when people you barely know ask, but it's a messed up cultural thing in some areas to be pushy and take that sort of initiative. People will ask you for cigarettes even if they don't know you, and you don't smoke, and they will ask you to watch kids you don't know....it gets crazy.

Now, I would absolutely help my friends out in an emergency, and I used to drive my epileptic neighbor (who I was actually friends with, and also helped me out at times too) to different places. But this random, ""Hey can I have a ride/Got any smokes/Can you watch my kids while I...."" stuff from people you just see on the streets sometimes is always a weird thing to deal with.

Edit: Also, in my experience  (I may be wrong), this happens to females more often. We are seen as safer, and less intimidating, so we get approached for rides and weird stuff."
"You don't have to ""pay it forward"" to them. If you want to help, do favors for friends or donate time/money to charity causes. These neighbors seem tone-deaf to be so demanding of a random neighbor who they have greatly inconvenienced. 

If you think they are neglecting or abusing their children, you can call CPS anonymously. I can't tell from your post if the kids are without food completely or if they are just trying to use you."
"That definitely sounds fishy! It's not like something like that just ""pops up"" - they would have known about that ahead of time and should have made accommodations and yeah, asked someone to pick them up. So annoying, sorry you're dealing with them :( "
"You should have suggested that. No need to be confrontational, but you definitely could have said, ‚ÄúI'm sorry, but I can't. Maybe one of your family members attending the service would be willing to give you a ride? Good luck!‚Äù"
"I get that honestly, I'm only just now learning to not let people walk over me haha. Good luck!"
"Yeah, but you're not dealing with people who are firing on all cylinders, you know? It is what it is, and you will most likely hear from them again. I get that you and I,and most folks, wouldn't keep asking, but these aren't like most folks. Just keep saying no, and stick to it. It's crap they put you in this situation, and I'm sorry you have to deal with it. I know from personal experience it's not pleasant. :( I think, just my own experience speaking out here, but I think you may just want to accept this is going to be this awkward crap they keep pulling, and have the mentality that you just gotta keep saying no for however long."
It will get easier the more you say no. They're counting on that guilt to wear you down. You should use it to get angry. Their trying to take advantage of your good nature.
"Yes, I agree, thank you. "
Thank you.
"LOL while I'd love to do that, I would be feeling even more guilty afterwards. It's really hard to overcome that early childhood negative conditioning."
That's a fantastic idea! 
LOL thank goodness for small favors!
"Yes, my apartment manager said they're nice people but they're clueless and careless. I don't want to be responsible for taking care of stuff they should have handled themselves. Thank you."
"That's really interesting, I hadn't heard of that before, though it makes a kind of sense.

Part of my issue was an abused childhood and constantly being told I was selfish when I was stating boundaries about my person and my belongings. I think it scarred me for life."
That's an excellent way to think about it! Thanks!
"Yes, that ""can I have a cigarette thing"" is weird too. I stopped smoking 16 years ago. How can you walk up to someone you don't see with a cigarette and ask for one? I live in an area that's been hit hard with gentrification and there are some really desperate people out on the streets right now who've been displaced so I'll give food if I have some on me, but that's the best I can do for others, being so poor and hanging on by the skin of my teeth myself. 

You make an interesting point about women being asked for favors. I hadn't thought about it but it definitely makes sense. "
"I don't think they're without food completely. Just, ""Can I borrow some beans?"" Like they're cooking dinner and realized they're out of what they planned on making. I think it's just poor planning and lack of life skills in general over child abuse."
"They seem like they're really irresponsible about taking care of their business and leave things for the very last minute and then scramble around trying to get other people to make up for their shortsightedness. I'm the kind of person who plans ahead, lays stuff out the night before I'm going to need it, etc. and I can't understand operating the way they do as a grown person with children to care for."
I really should have. It probably would have made me feel even worse afterwards. I hate that I've been conditioned to feel guilty for saying a simple no. I've been struggling with this my entire life.
"Thanks, you too!"
"Yeah, I think you're right that they're going to keep trying. I'm definitely going to keep saying no. I already know from my own experience that I'll be obsessing about actually caving in and giving them the favor even more than I do about just saying no in the first place so from that standpoint alone, it's healthier for me to just keep turning them down."
"I've been telling them no for quite a while now, I hope you are right and it will get easier. But it would be nice if it got easier faster, you know? haha"
"Yeah being taught to be nice as a kid can really make it hard to stick up for yourself as an adult. 
Source: am wimpy adult"
"Yeah, but the apartment manager doesn't live next to them, and have them asking her for rides all the time. They may be perfectly ""nice"" in the sense that they don't cause her problems, but they sound like a pain in the ass to live next to. "
"I remember just hanging out at a friend's apartment, and we were sitting outside talking. He's a guy, but was about my size at the time (I was 5'5, about 115 lbs.). Some random woman walked up and asked up for a ride to pick up her paycheck, and for a cigarette. He did give her a ride with me, to a local hotel and she went to the office and picked up her check. It's so weird that some people do stuff like that, but it's years of social conditioning to \*keep asking.\*  They've spent years going from door to door, asking for stuff like this and that, and don't see it as weird anymore.  

When that lady asked us, she walked right by a group of guys who worked as construction workers, who were outside drinking cokes and talking. We were less intimidating, and so she asked us. That is a huge part why  you keep getting asked, imo. I very much doubt they go up to large dudes all the time and ask them, though of course that could happen."
"They don't make arrangements because they take their problems and give them to other people to fix. As long as they know they can do this, they will keep asking you. You're their ""solution."" I guarantee they'll figure something out soon enough, you're just the easiest answer (for them) at the moment."
"The good news is that you chip away at that conditioning every time you practice saying no. I used to be like you, and it took some therapy, lots of co-dependence workbooks, and about five years of practicing saying no, but now I have absolutely zero trouble saying no to people. I'm still a good person--i go out of my way to help friends and strangers regularly, but I make sure that I'm no longer doing favors at the expense of my own well-being. Another great thing is that I feel really good about those times that I help people, because I don't feel bitter about being taken advantage of or manipulated. The gift is more pure."
"Eh, don't overthink it. They'll just move on to someone else. It's not their first time doing  this, I promise. It'll be ok. They'll work it out. 

If it makes you feel better, look at this way: On one hand, no man is an island, and it's great to help others, right? Sense of community and looking out for each, all of that. On the other hand, don't confuse that with this situation.  I grew up in a place where people could run up to their neighbors and ask them for help with kids or a ride, but they'd also be the first ones to run over and try to help me if I was in trouble.


This is NOT the same thing, and I think it's safe to say that a lot of places outside of suburbia or solidly middle class areas have people who pull these shenanigans. At least from what I've seen. Source: Always happened to me in trailer parks and  poorer small towns growing up, never happens to me in the middle class areas I live in now. We've been used to pulling together to take care of our neighbors, but there's always some who take and take and make it weird. This family has done this before, and they'll do it again. Their solution to a lot of life's difficulties has been to put their neighbors in awkward situations on the spot. As sure as the sun rises, they will figure something out. The easiest solution has just been to bug the shit out of you, but they're just grabbing the simplest thing for them now. They'll try other people, and if that doesn't work, huff and puff, then act like actual adults and make a proper arrangement to take care of their needs.

Don't feel bad about this, because they almost certainly don't feel bad about inconveniencing you all the time."
"Next time say""no, and my answer will always be no, so stop wasting your time asking me for favors."" Act offended, as really, you should be. They're out of line."
"They don't even live next to me, they live on the floor above, and they have 11 other units on their floor but come straight to me. I'm not the only tenant with a car by any means. We have a 40 unit building. For all I know they make the rounds of everyone with cars and it was my turn this week. "
"I can't understand asking complete strangers for a ride at all. That would be too scary for me. It's like some people live in a completely different universe to the one I live in, and we're just somehow occupying the same physical space."
"It's been four years of intermittent asking and no for an answer so far, I wonder if their soon is on the geologic scale. haha"
"I love the way you look at this! Thank you for sharing this with me, I will look forward to the day I stop obsessing about saying no to an intrusive person looking for favors out of nowhere."
"I'm trying, I wish it was easier to let go of early childhood conditioning about being ""selfish."" But you're right, I bet they don't even think twice about knocking on doors until they get what they're looking for. And some folks must give in so they're getting positive reinforcement for this behavior somehow, or you think they'd stop."
"I'll keep it in mind, I'm not sure I can be that person without spiraling about it for a week but if they keep going with this I will definitely try."
"Next time, cheerfully tell them you're very busy and your taxi service is permanently closed for business. These people aren't your friends. Trust me, they'll latch on to someone else soon enough. "
"Yeah, I used to think that too. I still do, but I'm not in that same area anymore, so it's a thing I just remember from my past. I remember thinking, as a young college kid taking my craptastic truck to school or work, that I would be TERRIFIED of being raped or murdered, just hopping into cars with random people. That's probably why they ask women though, cause we're ""safer"" so let's just pile on the young woman and do this stupid crap.

Trust me, I totally get what you're saying. I had to walk to work in the heat of the humid south in summer, and I still would never do that. It's just been this weird ass thing that a segment of society just...do. It's freaking weird and awkward as heck, even for someone who  grew up around it."
"Oh yeah, that's right, you are telling them no! Haha, I think I forgot that when I was typing! Well keep it up, and stick to your  guns. Good for you for declining and standing up a bit for yourself!"
"You'll get there! A key point is realizing that other peoples' emotions are not your responsibility. It's okay if someone feels sad or annoyed or angry when you tell them no. They have the right to feel however they feel. However, they also have the right of managing their own emotions--it's not your problem. One of the hardest lessons in overcoming codependency is really, really understanding that it's not your job to manage how other people feel. When you think about it, it's kind of arrogant to presume that you should try to control people in that way. By letting your neighbors feel however they feel without being wrecked with guilt or anxiety or rushing to fix it, you're actually respecting their autonomy and their own ability as adults to self-soothe and manage their own emotional lives."
"Just throwing this out there, but I am pretty sure some of my friends were put into really bad situations with crap like this. It's all well and good until they have you help them run an ""errand"" for something that gets you in trouble. You have kids to think about yourself, so if it helps you, maybe tell yourself that it's selfish to put yourself in a situation where you may lose custody of your kids because of inadvertently being part of a drug deal, or getting drawn into an altercation because of these mooches. Your priority is to your family, not the socially awkward leeches you happen to live near."
"And that's ok to feel that way, because you are a good person. Them, not so much."
Haha I like that! 
Thank you!
"It's kind of weird, it's not like I worry about how they feel about my saying no, it's the voice in my head that is telling me I'm being selfish for not giving in to other people, if that makes sense? But yeah, co-dependency is definitely at play here and it's something I've been working on for a long time. Thank you."
"This is great advice, turn my imagination to good use instead of just running in circles like it does, thank you!"
Thank you. 
"This was the hard lesson I learned. It's hard to be a good person and still have boundaries. It feels unnatural, but over time you will just shrug your shoulders and be able to say, ""not my problem!"", even if not out loud."
"Thank you, I really hope so. "
"You'll get there, just keep on keeping on, you're doing absolutely fine. You're not caving so far, just keep on."
"I stopped caving to people (for the most part) a long time ago but that inner dialog about me being ""mean"" or ""selfish"" when I do it has yet to disappear. "
"AH, been there my friend (although not gay), the key word here is:

\> seemingly 

When you are single for a while, everyone else in a relationship are in La La Land compared to you. This is ridiculously false assumption, mate. All the fights happen when couples go home. Google the Chinese ""face"" term - it applies so much to relationships that it aint even funny. :D

\> The weird thing is that most of my life I was perfectly fine being single. When I was college and focused all my energy on studies and friends, finding love (for the most part) was an afterthought. Even after graduating from college and I had moments where I decided I was sick of dating and needed a break, I was perfectly happy just being alone. So I'm not sure why I have such a deep feeling of wanting to be in a relationship right now.

I did similar things. Most of my friends who pursued graduate degrees did similar things. 

\> TL;DR - I feel lame af still never having been in a relationship at 24, and even more lame that a lot of my friends here are in happy relationships. I feel like a loser sometimes, honestly

This is the problem. Just because you are special, you are starting to think you belong in the loser spectrum and not the winner spectrum. What if you are so special that it is hard to find someone because your expectations are higher than modern hook-up culture? Most people, actually, most people 4 years older than you are I see are still struggling with hook-up culture - and I work in a similar setting compared to Wall St. 

Plus, it is not like you haven't tried, you did...you just didn't find the right one. That just further proves my point. 

TL DR: You wanna be special, you gotta have the patience to wait around for the right person. "

Then stick to your guns - doesn't matter what argument they come up with, this is just your personal preference and the way you want things to be, end of story. "
Your husband is the one that should be telling his sister all this. Not you. He just needs to tell her something like this is a romantic gettaway. Don't give out any flight and hotel details. 
Ugh that sounds like such an uncomfortable situation! I don‚Äôt really have advice but just wanted to let you know I feel for you. 
"Just politely let them both know that this is a planned trip between you and your husband and that you both have been looking forward to the alone time together.
It‚Äôs quite rude that they just invited theirselves like that honestly, so hopefully no drama will follow suit. Best of luck x"
"The discussion should take place between the actual siblings.  If this is your husband's sister, he has to shut her down asap and let their parents know that the two of you do not want any kind of shared vacation."
"Just tell them no. You two want alone time. Sexy time. The more details the less likely they‚Äôll want to join.

Or just tell them no."
I was going to say it's a belated anniversary trip or something like that. It defs needs to be made known it's just for the 2 of them. I don't want to make OP feel bad but this should have been done face to face so SIL would know.
"This, definitely. Short and sweet. Its honest without being insulting. "
"Yup this is great.

Also to avoid future issues, SIL needs to be on an information diet with respect to travel or fun plans you don't want her to hijack."
"This is the best response. There's no reason that they need to come, especially with small children. And if they get mad about it, they get mad. This is time for you and your husband, enjoy it!"
"Once you have a bf or gf all dating apps should be deleted. To keep them open means you do not believe the relationship will stand the test of time, so you keep your options open. This is just my opinion. But in a relationship i close those options because I‚Äôm in it for as long as life is willing. And if that means forever my options for another mate is closed forever. I had my time to explore those options when we were dating. Of course just my opinion. And i wouldn‚Äôt accept it him having them still open "
"Are you guys exclusive? Don't just assume that you are. You need to actually have a conversation about your expectations.

If you have had that conversation... then he obviously shouldn't be on any dating sites. However, if you haven't discussed it yet and you want to be exclusive then you should probably have that conversation soon. "
"i wouldn't worry about him being on the apps after you broke up, but the fact that he's still on them after you've reconciled is a 2 on the DEFCON scale as far as i'm concerned.  i hope i'm wrong, but it seems like he's treating you as a fail-safe plan.  "
"Is he using them? If he was on them during the time appear, I suppose it's possible he could have forgotten about them when you got back together.

I'm not saying that's how it is, but maybe just talk to him and ask? If you can't talk about things like that, getting back together may not be a good idea."
I‚Äôm my opinion if he was truly so torn up about the breakup why would he have put himself on dating apps so quickly right after? I think that is the first question you need to ask yourself because clearly he wasn‚Äôt too torn up about it to put himself back on the market....unless like you feared he never really took himself off.
You  should bring up the fact that he‚Äôs on these dating apps and then let him go.
"Why would you think he has changed at all, just because he allegedly praised you to this friend? He got you back without having to put in any effort to show a want to change at all, you just accepted him back into your life based off third-party information which may or may not be true, which your bf could also have put his friend up to telling you? Of course nothing has changed. Taking him back was a mistake, OP. He hasn't earned it."
Yeah I don't appreciate it. I guess I don't know if he is my boyfriend again or not.
"Yeah we probably should. I mean he's acting very invested in it, so maybe before confronting I should just figure out what our status is and then just check back on there in a few days to see if he's just taken it off himself and if not then talk to him."
"Yeah, that's my fear in all of this obviously. Just to play devil's advocate though: would you be hanging out with your fail-safe all the time and letting them stay with you and cooking them dinner and taking them on all kinds of dates? He's not really treating like I'm whatever, so that's also what I am finding confusing... It was similar to this before we broke up too which is why we did. I didn't find him on tinder or anything then though."
Cos that's what people do .. after a break up we go out and rebound
"Yeah, I mean I think that's why it bothers me so much because this plays right into the thing that drove us apart in the first place. Also, when we first met up we actually talked about the apps. He said he couldn't bring himself to message anyone and only got a few matches and that he hadn't gone out with anyone else or hooked up with them or anything. I said I was aware he had them because my friends had told me, and he asked if I did and I said no. The fact that he didn't go and get rid of them really makes me feel like crap about everything this week. "
You should probably ask that you labeled him as your boyfriend again 
"If you want to be exclusive then just *ask him* to disable his dating site accounts. It's not an unreasonable request. If you want/need something in a relationship, then don't be afraid to ask for it. "
"You need to talk to your boyfriend instead of wasting time here.  He knows you know about the accounts and you didn't ask him to delete them when you and he first discussed the accounts, so he probably thought it wasn't a big deal (especially if he was being truthful about the lack of response).

So, you and he need to discuss 1)  Are we exclusive?   2)  What are your intentions as far as our relationship?  3)  Tell him you would feel more secure in the relationship if he deletes his Tinder account.  You don't need to accuse or threaten or even ask him why he hasn't deleted.  Just let him know your preference and see what he says and *what he does*.  You should know what to do after that, depending on his responses."
"Hey that's amazing advice! It probably would be better to just ask him to do it rather than confront him about finding it. 

What are your thoughts on the fact that he didn't just automatically do this himself?"
Thank you for this response. This is very good advice. I think it'd be a more mature way to handle it. I intend to talk to him about it I just didn't want to overreact or something and wanted to bounce some ideas around here first. 
"He either forgot/ being lazy about deleting the apps or he thinks you might not work out. Stop trying to read his intention though, it's only going to make you anxious about it. I would make your request and if he obliges, move on. "
"Well, if you're not exclusive then why would he disable his accounts? Unattached people date multiple partners all the time. There's nothing inherently wrong with that *unless* you've agreed to only see each other. 

Sure, it'd be nice if he did it on his own without you having to ask... but some people just don't disable their accounts until they're officially off the market. Everyone is different. Likewise, a lot of people just plain forget that they even still have an active profile if they don't get a lot of responses and/or notifications. 

In my opinion, his reaction and/or response to you asking him to disable his dating accounts is much more important. "
"yeah... it seems like a reasonable request for sure, but then I think about the fact that I had to ask. ""Oh hey you say you're serious about me? Why don't you stop talking to other girls please?"" shouldn't that just be common sense? 

But you're right I broke up with him for a few months and wouldn't take him back so he might not be sure that I'm going to stick."
"Well I guess because we were exclusive before, and because he said he wanted to be serious. I know for a fact if he found me on tinder he would NOT be happy. "
But yet HE is on it- that says something 
"She sounds really immature and confused honestly. I hate giving the ‚Äújust break up‚Äù advice, but honestly, you can do better. You‚Äôre 22! You deserve to be having fun and being happy! This woman is holding you back severely! Good luck to you!"
"Sounds like she's putting a lot of thought in to what other people think of your relationship. Has she always been like that? Do you live in an area where it's not acceptable to be in a homosexual relationship?

I feel like a lot of how she's acting can be a result of what other people might think. Wanting a hotel instead of whatever plans were made could be so that your relationship isn't out in the open. Lying to her friends about it. Skipping an anniversary to go to a game presumably so she won't have to tell her friends why she's missing the game.

I don't know. I'm just making assumptions but that's how it sounds from your post. "
"You are not controlling. You are not asking too much. I would feel extremely hurt and worried if I was in your shoes. To keep this short, something is going on whether its infidelity, her being checked out of the relationship or whatever. I would NOT give in with her ""demands"" and doing it ""her way."" Go on your trip, enjoy it as much as you can and tell her that you two need to have a serious talk about how controlling SHE has been and how you feel neglected. Its just not right. She is borderline gaslighting you. I feel for you and it sucks that she is not providing the support you need on your trip. Something deeper is going.on. i recommend showing her that you are strong enough on your own for this trip (even if it takes a lot of effort in doing so)  showing her this may get under her skin and will possibly make her show her true colors/whats actually going on with her. Good luck. "
She seems to expect undue things from you financially. Most people aren‚Äôt rollin‚Äô in vacation/flight money at 22.
Thank you for your comment! I love her a lot but it‚Äôs hard these days. I need to think about how much our relationship means to me and if it‚Äôs worth this upset >< 
"That makes a lot of sense actually. I mean, her friends know about us being together but they only really ask about me as a joke. They called her a creep and weirdo (jokingly) for dating me when she‚Äôs older than me. So when she was asked about me with her sports friends she said I was older than I actually am but it still seems they disapprove. 

Where I live it‚Äôs fairly approved of to be gay, but it seems like everyone she tells disapproves of us. She‚Äôs been like this since we met, especially since I‚Äôm very openly gay and she only tells people who are very close to her. I wonder if asking her if she‚Äôs worried about people knowing about us is making things hard. I wonder if I‚Äôm not even seeing her side because I‚Äôm openly out and she‚Äôs not, she might just be scared D: 
Thank you for your comment! You helped me see a new side!! "
"I thought something deeper was going on too! I keep asking about if there‚Äôs something she‚Äôs scared of telling me. I promise her I won‚Äôt be mad. But she always says it‚Äôs nothing. 

I‚Äôm worried about her cheating because she cheated on her ex of 4 years with me for a month, she didn‚Äôt tell me, I found out on my own 6 months into our relationship

I love her and I don‚Äôt want to believe that that‚Äôs what she‚Äôs doing. But it worries me :s"
"I understand not wanting to believe that is going on. Regardless if that is actually what is happening, her behavior sucks and is really hurtful. Stand up for yourself, hon. Id be SO hurt if my loved one treated me like that."
"You say she cheated on your ex with you, but since you didn't know, she cheated on you too. Straight up. Think about that"
I don't think you need to tell her unless he is spending large amounts of time at the house when you aren't there. If it crosses the line to where he wants key privileges you absolutely need to chat with her before that happens. 
"Yeah, it's fine. When she moves back in have a chat about guests and boundaries and all that. But while she's gone she doesn't get a say what you do in your own home."
"It would probably just be polite to give her a heads up.   
It sounds like you and your boyfriend are pleasant people and no doubt you two will go nowhere near her stuff, so a simple text saying, ""Hey, I just wanted to let you know my boyfriend might spend a few nights with me while you're not at the apartment. Just didn't want to keep you in the dark.""  


You can even mention that you like him there to help you settle. You could say that until you feel comfortable you appreciate not being alone at the apartment so him staying helps you adjust.   


Moving forward, hopefully your roommate will be just a pleasant, so a simple, ""Hey, boyfriend is coming over tomorrow night,"" will be enough notice. "
"I don't see the need to tell her when she's not around, as long as none of her stuff gets messed with and you pay for all the utilities.

He'll obviously have to leave once she gets back."
"You should really not be fighting so hard to stay with him. He's trying to let you down easy; all that stuff about how he's not good enough for you if just some elaborate ""it's not you it's me,"" BS."
"Ok I‚Äôve read the comments, and I would advise you to rethink posting if your not going to listen. Everytime someone tells you to just let him leave you since it‚Äôs his choice you say something like haha funni but you‚Äôre wrong. If you aren‚Äôt going to listen to people‚Äôs advice don‚Äôt ask for it, because that just wastes all of our time.

Oh and if your just going to respond to me with ‚Äúget off my post since you won‚Äôt help‚Äù or ‚Äúthat‚Äôs not your problem‚Äù spare me. 

Furthermore, don‚Äôt tell someone they don‚Äôt know the full story or didn‚Äôt read all the details, when you didn‚Äôt provide much context. We know very little about the situation, and still people try to chime in, just for you to laugh them off. 

I personally am not gonna offer any advice on what you should or shouldn‚Äôt do, considering I don‚Äôt have much knowledge or expertise in this area. I wish you good luck, but I think the way you are handling this post‚Äôs comments is immature. 

The way you handled the top comment is the only one I thought was good in terms of people telling you it‚Äôs his choice to end it. Otherwise you seem to think this is all a joke or an excuse to be rude to people. I‚Äôd recommend you seriously look at how you‚Äôve been replying to people."
He doesn‚Äôt want you. He wants to break up with you. You are trying to trap him and you are worried about the toll it is taking on you?Jesus Christ.
"If you have to convince someone to stay, it's over. It should have ended already. He doesn't want to be with you, be a good person and let him go!"
"The man feels like shit. You need to leave him or let him leave. He's trying to figure out his own shit and you are keeping him from doing that and will be collateral damage if you continue down this path. 

I have been in his frame of mind before and it's not a healthy one. It is one that seeks validation and affirmations. You cannot provide those for him because you're with him and he takes it for granted. This is a mindset that will lead him to cheating and you don't want to be around for any of that. I was a hair's breadth from that point at one time and have seen many others fall victim to that trap. So I implore you, while it will hurt more than you even realize now, **leave**."
It's pretty pathetic to cling on to someone who doesn't want you.
Do you really want to be with someon who keeps having to be convinced to stay with you? Wouldn‚Äôt you rather be with someone who actually wants to be with you?
"Lets see how much one can bet on someone whos almost sure to fail. A very rare and dangereous experiment for the 21st century. I support the brave ones. But make sure you help him some other way too... He needs to find power through his own eyes, he needs medical help too [from what you mentioned]. Slow down the drama and show him that life really isnt that deep, some practicity is enough to survive and probably be happy."
"First of all I beg a differ. He's not trying to push you away. He's looking for a place to belong to, to know that he is loved. I know it's stupid and immature but he's going through so very fucking much right now that he THINKS he letting you down easy but he's just trying to shut everything down. Give him some space and then talk to him. If he's breaking up for you than I KNOW he doesn't want to break up. Only leave when he's breaking up for him."
"Check your bullshit at the door, asshat. Did you read the post? Have you been in a relationship with someone who's sick before? Go off and die alone and leave OP to get some real advice.

""Jesus Christ."""
"Yeah you are right. I've been on the other side, trying to get out of a relationship and staying when I don't want to.

He needs to grow and if he needs to break up with me to do it, then I shouldn't stop him.

I'll probably change my mind, but thanks lol."
Indeed I am m8
"What kind of crazy pills are people taking? Someone can break up with you for literally any reason and you have to respect and accept that. 

Breaking up is not a debate."
"What you're saying is actually what he told me after the most recent near break up. On top of what I mentioned, he also had an emotionally abusive upbringing, his parents constantly made him think he wasn't good enough and that's how he feels with me.

Exactly. If the issue was with me, or with our relationship, I wouldn't fight it so much. Since awful past relationships, I've refused to play mind games. I don't want to break up, so I'm going to fight for him. But perhaps I should give him space. Which in fact; I suggested, to which he said ""Oh so you DO want this?"" OHMY WHAT DO YOU WANT."
"If he doesn‚Äôt want to be with her, which he has said multiple times, then it is a terrible thing to try to force him to stay, which she has done multiple times. 

You need help if you think what she is doing is okay or healthy, bro."
No need for such language.
If you were a dude posting about how you don‚Äôt let your girlfriend break up with you when she tries to people would be in here losing their shit telling you that you are emotional abusive - because it is. 
"That whole I'm breaking up with you for you're betterment is bs. Maybe it's because most people don't go through it and don't think about it in this way, but it's how some people deal with all the stress and depression in their life. When there is still someone that cares about them, they have to bounce back and they can't just give up. Look, whether she stays with him or not is up to her, but to me it's a cry for help. Maybe I'm wrong but I've been there and I've done that. Just saying.

I'm well aware that if he keeps it up, she'll break and say fuck it but right now it might just be a defense mechanism."
"People can break up for others for any reason, not just the ones you think are acceptable. And that choice should be respected.

It sounds like you both are playing mind games.    "
Thank you for the reply.  As a person who's childhood and parental relationship isn't great and as a person who does what he does a lot giving him space is a plus and just let him come back when he's ready. I'm sure he will and has thanked you for not giving up on him. And I hope he realizes that these things will become better and not to push you away to much. <3
"I'm not fukin tying down and forcing him to be with me. Jeez.

Lol healthy? This entire thing ain't healthy; hence why I'm seeking advice."
"He was a bit too aggressive in how he worded things, but I also understand his anger. I worked a couple years in a hospital and saw people leave their spouse that was ill all the time and that shit always struck me as incredibly cold.

I (think) I would never do that but I did learn the type of thinking over the years that leads to this decision. If your partner is sick, how long would you stay? If you're 25, you've been in a relationship for two years, and they contract an illness that guarantees a life full of pain and care, would you still commit if everything was going well beforehand? What if you were 45 and caught them cheating half a year earlier and you were working through it when they got the news? 30 and they didn't do anything wrong necessarily except be an ass?

The crux of the issue is betrayal and commitment. I have seen plenty of people end a relationship they didn't want to end for the others benefit, because they knew they couldn't be a good partner. The lack of support sped their demise in one way or another and grew a guilt in the other that they'll never forget, but that's what they thought was best even it wasn't necessarily for the best.  I've also seen vice versa, everyone loves Dad until he gets sick and can't buy as much shit anymore, then it's ""kick rocks.""

If you actually love someone and want the best for them, but circumstances have made it unhealthy to continue the relationship for yourself, choosing whether to stay or go is a case by case decision and one that can be exceedingly difficult to make for a variety of reasons. Would I still stay with him if he wasn't sick? How much of the discord is due to sickness and how much is on them? Will they ever be better? How long should I wait? Where do my responsibilities and commitment end and my own self preservation begin?

It's one of the hardest questions to answer and everyone has a different solution."
"Lmao how did she force him? Hold a gun to his head and say ""this pussy be yours FOREVER!!!""? No one forced him to stay with her. LMFAO cool ""bro"". Thanks for your input, now I have something to post to r/funny."
I thought you might be an angry meninist. Sort out your internalised sexism before you start sharing your wisdom.
"It doesn‚Äôt matter if you think someone‚Äôs reason for breaking up with you is BS *you still have to accept the fact that they are breaking up with you* 

"
"He has tried to break up with you three times and you what? Won‚Äôt let him? 

Grow up. If someone wants to break up with you that‚Äôs their right. "
"> Hold a gun to his head and say ""this pussy be yours FOREVER!!!"" 

Pahahaha fuckin hell lol"
"Because saying it‚Äôs not okay to guilt someone into staying with you when they have tried to break up with you three times instead of accepting that it is their choice to break up? Okay, sure."
"Sounds like you've never been in a relationship, maybe don't hang around r/relationships. Not going to bother justifying myself to you."
"Well I'm doubting you did anything like that lol.

I've been in this situation as the person who's sick. I'm very glad my partner stuck aorund and didn't listen to my BS. So I don't think you're wrong. But at a certain point, yeah, he may just want to end it. I don't think that's the case given the info you've provided however. It sounds like he's scared, and upset with everything that's happened, and he's worried about being a burden. And that's not really a realistic feeling to have."
Didn't guilt him. Never said I did. 
"You're 21, you're still young and learning (no disrespect).

If he was your spouse of many years, then sure, it would make sense to keep trying. But you shouldn't be going through this drama at your age."
"Yeah, that's the thing. He argued that he didn't want to make all the plans to get married, have kids, house, etc, and then just die. You're right, he is scared; he's scared to be happy.

I want him to risk it though, I'd personally rather live a life of huge ups and downs than just safe, lonely and grey."
"That's all you can do, just let him know where you stand. But at the same time respect him, and if he continues to try to break up with you, you need to take stock and see if this is what you want. Because it's not good to keep yourself in such a stressful situation. And if things do end, believe me when I say there will be more people, who are different, that you could fall in love with in whole new ways."
"My dad is just like your husband. He grew up with wealthy but miserly parents that never spent a penny on him or celebrated a single birthday, and he gets very weird about any money being spent on presents.

What confuses me is: did you not know your husband was like this? Don't get me wrong, the way he blew up at you is not an acceptable way to communicate, but maybe part of his upset comes from feeling like you don't actually know him at all, and that the expensive gift was all about *you*, and not about him."
"Does he come from a poor background?  While his reaction was a bit over the top, his childhood and early adulthood financial situation can explain it.  For some people there's never enough cushion because they worry about the 'what ifs' too much, and usually look at the negative side when it comes to that."
"Evidently, you two are not on the same wavelength as much as you thought you were. You may have some big incompatibility with money handling. 

While it is important for shared finances to be agreed upon, his reaction was bad. If there is an issue, it should be resolved with open health communication, not with yelling, and then passive aggressive and attacking statements. 

If counseling is helping you two, you probably could benefit from more of it, especially on this issue. "
">It‚Äôs not like we‚Äôre poor. We pay the bills on time and have regular debts like car payment and school loans.

Are you 100% certain about your financial situation?

Other than that - did his parents treat him like he wasn't worth anything?"
"I understand that you share money, but do you have a set amount of spending money for each of you that is yours to use however you wish? If not, you should. It sounds like he feels this gift ate into money that would normally go into savings or to bills, so it doesn‚Äôt feel like a gift to him. 


His reaction was pretty rude, but you also need to consider the fact that you spent a lot of money on him when you should probably know that‚Äôs not what he would want by now. "
"I don't think money is the real issue. If it was, he wouldn't have a problem with you taking the bottle back for a refund!

While you might have misjudged things, you obviously know his taste as he liked what you got him. I have a feeling he is venting some broader frustration here. 

How do you share your finances? Sounds like you could do with some clear division on spending money, where you each have a certain amount of 'pocket money' per month to spend on what you wish, no questions asked. That way you could choose to spend your own money on his gift and you're not 'wasting' anything from the shared pot."
"How in debt are you? Are you able to save/pay the debt down each month? 

Sounds like you two need to get on the same page about budget. It's thoughtful of you to get him a great birthday gift, but I can also see his perspective. You two need to talk about money expectations and make sure you're agreed on where to spend your money. Those can be hard conversations, but are the only way to prevent situations like this."
"He told you what he wanted: for you to not spend money on him. You went against what he wanted to do what YOU wanted. You made his gift about you, not him. 

Why didn't you respect what he said he wanted? His response was rude, but you can't have thought he'd be grateful. "
[deleted]
"I am confused by a lot of these replies. There is no excuse for him to have yelled at you or given you the silent treatment. Normally, when someone receives a gift they didn't really want from someone who is well meaning, the proper behavior is either just thank you, or if you are close to that person, a thank you sandwich: 1.) Thank you, that was so sweet, 2.) It doesn't fit / it's too expensive / it's not my style / (whatever doesn't work about the gift; 3.) But that was so sweet of you to think of me / go to all this trouble, big hug, etc. 

Since you mention that you have been having a lot of relationship issues, I think you need to elaborate on that. Does he have a history of putting you down, either directly or subtly? Does he sometimes very critical for no reason and reason, acting like no matter what you do, it's not good enough? Does he often give you the silent treatment? Does he do or say something hurtful and then at some point turn around and act completely normal, like nothing happened, everything goes back to normal, and you feel like it's best not to even bring it up? Does he switch from being warm and loving to being cold without much rhyme or reason? Does he act mean and then blame it all on stress? Do you sometimes feel like you have to walk on eggshells around him? 

Do you earn more than him? 

In any event, his behavior is not that of a loving life partner, period. It is absurd to me that everybody on this thread is blaming you for trying to be nice. His behavior is at fault here. It is as if he is trying to push you away. Perhaps you hope that if you work hard enough, you can save the relationship. Well, it takes both people to make or break a relationship. If he refuses to put in the work, there is nothing you can do to make up for that. "
"Okay, first off, who does the budget? You or him? I take care of all of our money, bills, budgeting, etc in our relationship so sometimes it seems like my partner doesn‚Äôt quite understand why we can‚Äôt just go blow $30 (that‚Äôs a lot for us). 

Secondly, you say you have debts. Are you struggling to make ends meet after paying debts, bills, leftover needs, etc? Are the debts on the minimum payment or high interest? Because if so, I could also understand why your husband would be upset that you ‚Äòwasted‚Äô money when it could have gone towards half another payment instead. 

Third of all, are there things you two are saving for? Kids, new house down payment, new car, retirement just getting started, emergency savings, etc? Do you regularly put enough into your savings? Because if your husband is feeling nervous about how much is going into savings, I can see why he‚Äôd be upset over $90 spent on a want. 

Fourth of all, have you done this during other years? Has your husband always had a thing about money (it seems so from the post - did he grow up poor or with a financially irresponsible parent)? Humans have this weird thing where they get into a routine and can get confused, upset, or even angry when their rituals change. This is why some little kids freak out if they eat breakfast before they shower. Your husband might‚Äôve been in the routine to never buying gifts, and then you upset that, and he was so surprised that he overreacted with anger. He may also now feel pressured to do something expensive for you on the next holiday. 

Talk to him. Talk about what would‚Äôve been an appropriate gift, what he likes and doesn‚Äôt like about gift giving, why he is stressed over spending, etc. He should apologize and you should come to this from a place of understanding - go talk about it in therapy if you think it‚Äôd be helpful. 

A suggestion from somebody who has to count every dollar: to avoid fights, my SO and I will discuss a ‚Äògift budget‚Äô before the holidays, our anniversary, etc. Then I know not to go over x amount of dollars so I‚Äôm not stressed about one of us getting something significantly more expensive, or one of us being upset over what was spent. "
"He shouldn't have yelled obviously. But once that's out of the way, well, I guess I can see it from his perspective if your finances are totally joint. In essence, he had to buy himself half of an expensive bday present he didn't want.

Maybe the solution, a pretty easy one I think, is to have a joint account for household expenses, and your own accounts for other things. That way you can splurge knowing it's your OWN money (though I still woudn't expect him to be down with an expensive gift), and he can penny pinch, save all he wants.

When i was married we had everything joint and it definitely created arguments, and we weren't even that far apart on the spending-saving spectrum. I would never do it again."
"It seems like this is conflating two separate issues:

He doesn't like spending having money spent on him, but you like spending money on him sometimes. You can talk this one out, you do get a say. You could discuss how to handle similar occasions in the future so that both of you get your needs met, maybe with a little compromise. Maybe you want to be spoiled with gifts sometimes yourself?

Also, his reaction to not liking what you did was to yell, which is just flat-out rude and unacceptable. He should work on communicating his needs respectfully. The strop about you not knowing him at all is also not constructive. When you have your sensible discussion, maybe he can calmly communicate what his actual needs are."
Sounds like he was quite clear about not wanting you to spend money and you went ahead and did it anyway. The yelling was not okay but I'm not sure why you thought it would go over well. 
How long have you known this person?
"> I offered to take it back for a refund and he refused

> He also said now he would have to work overtime this week to make up for the money wasted

This strikes me as manipulative. You offered to rectify the issue, as stated by him, and he wouldn't let you. Then later it's still your fault that the issue is not rectified?

I know that I'm only getting a brief snapshot of your life. But does your husband yell at you a lot? Do you get blamed a lot for things that aren't your fault?"
"Another thing to think about - don‚Äôt conflate how he feels about spending money with how he decided to tell you about his issue. 
Some people do become uncomfortable with fininacial situations, gift giving, etc. When he was upset, instead talking about the issue rationally, or taking a minute to take in the situation, or table the issue for later, he chose to yell at you in an intimate moment. Why he chose to yell at you (instead of working with you to talk about the issue) is irrelevant. He chose to yell, argue, and be accusatory. And on top of that he is telling you how you should or shouldn‚Äôt spend your money. "
"I am not at all comfortable with people spending money on me. I am not a gift person, I would much rather just buy stuff for myself, so I don't have to stress if what I got them is just as good. I like giving gifts, it makes me happy, but I don't like getting them. 

I also am not a birthday person at all. My parents get my gifts, so do a select few friends, and there are also some cards; I just don't like a day that is all about me. I don't want to be the center of attention, that's not my personality. 

So, I have told my boyfriend that I don't like presents and other than Christmas (which we compromised on), I really would prefer if he didn't get me anything. He thought that I was tricking him and that I would later yell at him for not getting me anything. No I am actually more likely to cry and stress over getting a present. 

Your husband shouldn't have yelled, that wasn't right but you need to learn to respect his wishes. It might not be what you would want but you're not the same people. The gesture was nice, but sometimes people really do mean what they say. "
"Imho, he sounds like an ass. You bought him a gift for his birthday, something that happens once a year. What is the point of living if you can't treat yourself every once and a while... He should seek some sort of counseling about his fear/hate of spending money.

You did nothing wrong OP. You gave him the option of returning for a refund but he refused."
"His birthday should be about him and what he likes, how he likes to do things, what makes him happy. Instead, you made it about you, what you like, what you like to do, and what makes you happy. And you didn't do it on purpose, I know, I trust and believe that. You thought you were doing something great. Next time, think about what makes him happy. Saving money makes him happy? Do that! It may feel wrong to you, but it's not about you on his birthday.





For your birthday, he needs to do the same for you. 




The two of you may need some counseling on this. In fact, I'm pretty sure you do. Financial disagreement is like a cancer. Good luck! "
"I cannot fathom a life with no special treats, gifts or surprises. To be so controlled with what you spend not just during the year but when it is acceptable ie birthday feels abusive and I could not live under these circumstances. You are a teacher and make money - think long and hard if this is how you want to spend the rest of your life. Best of luck "
"As someone who doesn't really care about birthdays and who doesn't like gifts, it seems like your gifts for him were quite selfish. *You* wanted a reason to celebrate and spend money and found an excuse that he ""should"" be ok with. The thing is, it's his birthday, and by celebrating it this way, you're saying either you don't care about what he wants, only what you want, or you're saying you don't know him at all. Neither of which is a good birthday present.

If you want to celebrate your birthday or anniversary, you should tell him that. But trying to do it ""for"" him just seems passive aggressive at best and selfish and inconsiderate of his feelings, at worst.

Also, to me, if I still have debt (other than mortgage), I would not spend $100+ on my birthday. I do actually spend about that much, but it's usually for a house upgrade, not a consumable."
"The way I see it, yes, you did do something wrong. You should have been more aware of his beliefs. I completely understand why he feels hurt - he made sure that you knew, he doesn't like spending money, and you didn't keep that in your regard. I think, you, perhaps, could have at least had a talk before that - asking him if he would be fine with an expensive gift.

Honestly, even your title seems a bit passive-aggressive. You said he is furious cause you got him a gift - making him seem like he's some vile, unempathetic or ungrateful scummy dude. When in reality, this was a person, who felt like his beliefs were disrespected and disregarded.

I don't agree with him yelling at you, though. He should have held his composure better.

Please make sure to be more communicative with your partner. You may not agree with his beliefs, but you've got to respect them. This is what being a team in a relationship is. Good luck!"
"My dad has done the same thing. One year for his birthday, we pitched in to get new pool lounge chairs. They were on sale but still cost $500 in total. He was LIVID and made us return them. 

You know what we learned? Not to spend anything on him. He was happy with going to his favorite pizza place for his birthday and being with his family. Of course we still buy him Christmas presents but nothing for birthday. 

So onto your husband. Now you know. Yes, his reaction was well over the top. But also. If he doesn't want lavish gifts, then he doesn't want them. And that's okay (his reaction is not). 

This sub really boils down to one thing. Communication. Talk to your husband and come to an understanding about your finances as a couple and where each other is comfortable spending money. "
"Okay, first off, the way he handled this was not healthy. Even if he thought you were in the wrong and felt hurt by your actions, you don't communicate that by yelling and guilt tripping. This is totally uncalled for regardless of whatever reasons he may have for feeling this way, and it is definitely something that should be addressed.  

But to offer some perspective, my partner is kind of similar in terms of his attitude towards spending. I tend to be more liberal with my money, whereas he's pretty frugal. We don't have shared finances, and are actually fairly well off, but live together and have been together long enough that how we spend our money impacts one another. I know he feels uncomfortable with spending a lot, so when I give him gifts or take him out I opt for the price range he's comfy in. Gifts are especially personal, so spending a ton on him would probably irk him quite a bit. For this reason I usually make him something myself,  which is both cheaper and more sentimental.  

All that said, I know this preference of his because he told me, straight up, very calmly and kindly ""I know it might sound weird, but this amount of spending makes me uncomfortable and unable to enjoy it. It's nothing personal, just a preference."" I respect him by being sensitive to that preference, and he respects me by communicating clearly and compassionately.  

It sounds like this respect between you guys is getting lost in translation and more tenderness is needed."
Is it maybe making him feel guilty that he bought such a crap gift for your birthday? Internalized shame can make people lash out. 
"I definitely think you should tread lightly.  I‚Äôm not even going to touch on his behavior, everyone else has. But, seriously... if he thinks you don‚Äôt know him at all, that is not good for your relationship. My cousin divorced his longtime wife for something very similar to this, people take their partner disregarding their feelings very serious. I couldn‚Äôt imagine being in a relationship with someone who completely disregarded who I am and what I like over their own feelings so they can feel better about themselves.

This was obviously an action you expected to get brownie points from and it backfired. It‚Äôs obvious you don‚Äôt know him and maybe it‚Äôs because you don‚Äôt let what he says sink in because you don‚Äôt agree which isn‚Äôt how you‚Äôre supposed to do relationships. Screw everyone for saying he should have been grateful for doing something he‚Äôs made clear in the past he does not want."
"I think you should each have your own account / money set aside in your budget to spend as you see fit (without justification). So if it comes out of your slush fund, he can‚Äôt get mad since it‚Äôs your $"
"Either you have some financial problems only he is aware of, or he's completely irrational and disrespectful. If it's the former, you need to do some digging - is he gambling for example? If its the latter then honestly I can't believe you're married to him and have only just seen this side of him. Why would you want to be married to someone who isn't gracious enough to accept a nice gift, but more importantly yells at you and makes you feel bad about yourself? "
"Extreme frugality, hoarding, over-working, over-cleaning, over-planning and discomfort with sudden changes or unexpected events are sometimes indications of OCPD, especially if somebody is willing to sacrifice personal relationships for those other goals. He seems to exhibit a few of those.

The painfully extreme pursuit of perfection - in career, in budgets, in house or car - is not necessarily OCPD. But if he is crazy about strict budgets, hates unexpected deviations from his expectations to the point he yells at you, intends to work overtime to fix it, that's all possibly consistent with OCPD.

Also, he refused to return it. That's a common OCPD thing. You ruined things and he doesn't want you to unwind the ruining because, for him, that's like he saying he can't be upset because the money is back.  It takes a lot of communication work to realize that OCPD folks are actually upset you disregarded their emotionally central goals.

If I am right, then he's not just mad the money was spent, he's mad that you ignored his budgeting priorities. Even if you return it for the money, he's still upset you disregarded his budgeting priorities. He goes to an absurd place and yells because his disordered thinking interprets your actions as an attack on him and his priorities.

He needs to work on his communication. You can request he pursue some therapy to learn cognitive mechanisms to handle his thoughts and feelings.

As a sidenote, you got him a thoughtful, generous present. He doesn't like those. I think you would like that and you made the classic mistake of treating him the way you want to be treated. Maybe you guys can communicate clearly that you will respect his need for inexpensive gifts, but you would like him to respect your need for thoughtful gifts.

If, after that conversation, you find that he cannot move out of his comfort zone for you, then why are you living your life out of your comfort zone for him?"
"> We share finances so I don‚Äôt see how this could be a money issue.

Could you connect the dots on your thinking here? He doesn‚Äôt like spending money. You just spent some of his money (along with your own). How does shared finances make this not about money?"
"I think there is some lingering resentment on your part, like when you say he doesn‚Äôt do anything for your birthday. 

Are you happy in this relationship otherwise? Does he yell at you a lot? Do you find yourself walking on eggshells so as not to get ‚Äúin trouble‚Äù?"
Are you ok with not spending money on dates or your birthday?
"My husband is not great with money, and I come from a poor background. I am the ‚Äúnever spend money‚Äù one and he is the ‚ÄúI have to constantly tell my hands no‚Äù one. We‚Äôve worked on it and he has helped me know it‚Äôs not so awful to spend on myself and I have taught him to be responsible.

I say that say this: my husband knows full well that if he bought me a $90 bottle of perfume I would be upset first, and possibly ok with it later. So he wouldn‚Äôt do it, because he knows it would make me uncomfortable to spend that kind of money.

Now, if we each had our own ‚Äúallowance‚Äù each pay period, and he saved some of his to get me a gift, that‚Äôs a different story. Because that is money that has already been allocated to discretionary spending.

Basically what I‚Äôm saying is, it sounds like you got him a gift that you would want to receive, and not a gift that he felt ok or appreciated receiving. 

He shouldn‚Äôt have yelled at you, but, if you know that he doesn‚Äôt like spending money, you shouldn‚Äôt have spent $90 on cologne for his birthday."
"It‚Äôs sounds like it‚Äôs a money philosophy issue. He doesn‚Äôt like spending, the question is why? Is he just cheap or did he come from a poor background or saw someone lose money (or experienced this himself). It seems extreme, 90 dollars isn‚Äôt a big sum if you pay all your bills and pay off payments etc etc so something else is going on.

I think you need to ask him"
You should have removed the huge pole that‚Äôs up his butt for his birthday. 
So you know that he doesnt like when soneone buys him expensive gifts but you still did. Youre at fault here
"The wording in your thread title shows that you still aren't listening to him, and I suspect that's why he's so mad. 

Your title boils the issue down to ""I bought him a birthday gift."" And even at the end, I cringed at the innocent martyr overtones here: ""Did I do something wrong? I never thought I would be getting yelled at for buying someone a gift.""

You don't need to have a conversation with us. You need to have a conversation with your husband - one where you do more listening than talking, so you understand why he's upset, and so he doesn't feel like he has to yell to get you to listen to what he's actually saying."
"Your husband handled that poorly, no doubt about that, but enough folks have commented on that so I won't. 

I get where's coming from about the feeling like you did something that you know he wouldn't like. You know what he's like and decided to do something contrary anyways... That would make me mad too."
"24 year old guy. If my partner and I were dirt poor and she bought me a gift (that I know was a little expensive) I would be beyond grateful. Who cares if I would have to maybe work a weekend or work a little overtime or maybe tighten my personal budget for a couple of weeks. They took the time out of their day to do something special for me and I could not fathom yelling at my partner over this. There‚Äôs so many nice people in this world who would do anything to be your teammate, not your enemy. You only get 1 life, don‚Äôt waste it with someone like him."
"As an explanation, not an excuse: some people feel deeply uncomfortable with receiving gifts, as they question if they have ""earned"" it. Receiving a gift is a vulnerable act and it is rather common, yet still highly problematic, that your husband responded in anger to this discomfort. I don't think this is about money, but rather about insecurities.

Let's back up to your expectation that you should receive nothing for your own birthday? That your birthday isn't even it's own event in your words? That also seems problematic and unfair. "
"The money isn't the issue here. 

It sounds like he's upset because he feels you disregarded his discomfort about spending money without a real purpose to it. 

I get that you were trying to do something nice, and it certainly wasn't right of him to yell at you. But if you were at all aware of his feelings around spending, then I can see how he might feel upset and unheard. You having good intentions is irrelevant if your actions have caused him upset. 

I would suggest you start with an apology for making him feel like his feelings were being dismissed, and then open up a conversation about spending and how you guys can set more reasonable expectations around disposable income as spending (e.g. it's okay to spend up to $50 for non-essential personal things in the moment, but larger purchases should be discussed beforehand). "
"My boyfriend is a bit like your husband in that he *hates* having money spent on him. He dislikes asking for money, he dislikes asking for birthday gifts/anniversary gifts and a majority of gifts I've gave him, I've had to convince him greatly to get him to accept them. 


Last year on our anniversary, I bought him 2 t-shirts as a gift, mostly because he needed t-shirts. That's really the only way he'd accept the gift. It's odd, because I love receiving gifts and presents, but he is different.


My question is, did you know your husband doesn't like having money spent on him? I figured since you're married you would know this, unless he just recently became this way, or you may have never had the conversation. I think you need to sit down with your husband and discuss this, and maybe visit a therapist again (if you have stopped seeing a therapist). I would also keep in mind for future gift giving times that perhaps you should keep to maybe homemade gifts, or gifts he needs, such as socks or underwear or shirts or something. "
Tell him to stuff it. He can dislike the gifts and have a conversation with you like an adult instead of yelling. Next year just don‚Äôt get him anything
"There are multiple issues I could see where this came from, albeit it was still a bit of an overreaction, but my narcistic mom also tells me to stop yelling when I'm just calmly stating facts. 

Are you both working? If you are not then I could see getting upset over someone spending MY money for something I might not have spent it on. 

How much savings have you got? It may not be enough for him. This is also related to him maybe being the one managing finances. I've seen multiple posts of people thinking a couple hundred bucks are enough. 

How much is he spending on himself? Related to the first point. If I'd want to save up as much as possible or not spend something on myself rather than do X, I might get upset if my SO did not know this/disregarded it. 

Did you tell him the price? I'm no expert but maybe Oban can cost more and he assumed it cost more? 

You mentioned in a comment that his parents were also not spending much. People tend to copy their parents so maybe that. His parents might have also done something else to him. If none of the above apply I would try this and asking him about it."
"You need to sit down with him and together lay out a budget, which includes a healthy amount of fun money for both of you and a gift and date budget, and that you expect him to use the gift and date budget because you clearly aren't happy with the current situation either.  "
"You bought him an expensive gift despite knowing he doesn't like spending money?

You should apologize. That would make for a better gift."
"Are both of you working? Both contributing financially to the household?
"
"Did you actually pay for all of this out of your own pocket?  or did you use the family money for all of this?  If it's out of his own pocket not yours, then i understand why he's upset."
"If it was entirely your money you should be able to spend as much as you want on him. Was that money part of your home budget that is supposed to be managed by both of you? If so, then I don't think it was right to spend it how you see fit, even though it was meant to be *for him*. Another thing is that, since you have always known that he doesn't like spending money, you  must have known that he wouldn't like money splashed on him (you only mentioned the price of the whisky, but didn't say how much the car refubrishment cost you, but I imagine it must have been quite a spending, wasn't it? Yet another thing is that you're saying ""his"" car, not ""our"" car, so making changes in his car without his agreeing doesn't seem right to me). I think that his feelings should have been taken into account more and his being unhappy now is justified. Are you sure you were trying to make him happy, not yourself, by giving him these gifts?"
"It sounds like you need to share finances a little less, tbh.  Like maybe have a budget where each of you puts something in for bills, for household groceries, and for saving, but then have a set amount that you can each spend every month.  That way he knows special things are coming out of your spending money, and not something that he has to work overtime for."
"Two expensive gifts was over-kill. Either the detailing or the whiskey would have been enough, and even that could have been too much. Next time go for the mug."
"I have been cross about expensive presents in the past because my ex had around ¬£16k worth of debt and was constantly over spending, even with a good income.
I‚Äôd listen to the advice on here about your joint budgeting etc and also try and talk about how he feels about money and his relationship to it. Then share yours. 

If you talk about it then you can come to an understanding. "
"Either you two have financial problems you are not aware of, or you really do not know the person you got married to. If it is the former, if you have any indication this might be the case, you need to discover the truth of the situation. 

It honestly sounds like it might be the latter, though. Why go all out on his birthday when he specifically told you not to? By doing this, you made his day all about you because you resent him for never doing anything for your birthday. Your hubby is a saver, so do not buy him gifts or expect any in return. If that is something you cannot live with, perhaps you two are not compatible. "
"""i did something i knew would anger my husband. why did he blow up on me? is it my fault??""

ffs. 

ofc that sort of reaction is very disproportionate BUT you married him. if that sort of thing is too much for you, why marry him in the first place... im with him on this ""He accused me of not knowing him "". "
You should youtube the show Extreme Cheapskates
"Does he buy you expensive gifts? It's hard to say whether you did something wrong without knowing if you knew beforehand that he'd be upset with such an expensive gift.  

His reaction is over the top personally but if he's repeatedly told you that he's uncomfortable with receiving expensive gifts and then you did it anyway then he might feel like you don't care about his feelings. Another commenter just told me off for talking about my personal experiences but in my experience people who get this mad are generally really anxious about money and think ""one day we might be $90 down"". It sounds like he's had the value of money and working for it drummed into him. I guess the issue is whether his anxiety is justified or not. It sounds like it isn't from your description.  

He won't let you return it because he might think that'd be an insult, he knows you meant well. Have you talked to him about why he has this kind of anxiety when it comes to money? Or is this the first time this has happened? And is it true that he'll have to work overtime or is that him just being dramatic?  

Definitely try to talk to him and try to not let it escalate into a vs cage match."
"He's reacting to his calculation of the opportunity cost the ""excess"" spending caused."
"Have you ever read about Love Languages? I believe there's a book by that title. Basically, people feel loved and appreciated in different ways, such as physical, verbal appreciation, acts of service, or gifts. I suggest you read/research the idea and talk to your husband about it. It will help you know how to show him love in the future. It's OK to not know how to show love to someone, just a learning process to go through."
"Yikes, sounds like a very unappealing life. There's frugal then there's insane penny pinching. My mom was married to the second and it was miserable."
"Your husband is an asshole and a cheapskate.

DOnt buy him anything else but buy your self nice stuff.

What a sad miserable way to live"
Keep in mind she offered to take the bottle back and he declined and enjoyed it. He liked and wanted the gift he received but berated her for spending.  That is abuse. She works and she tried to do something nice for him for his birthday and he loses it ? If he was so concerned w the money he would have taken the bottle back. This is about control; more specifically controlling her. That‚Äôs abuse. 100% and a lifetime with someone like that would be very very hard. 
What you did wrong was marrying an asshole.  
"Tbh I‚Äôm just like your husband. I loathe people spending money on me, especially for my birthday. I did not accomplish anything (like a graduation) and I don‚Äôt see any reason to celebrate it other than maybe dinner and a movie.

I feel like it is disrespectful to buy your SO a gift when you know he doesn‚Äôt like them. You are literally ignoring their requests. I know you probably really enjoyed buying it for him but his feelings are valid. I would react similarly.

Why not plan an activity for the two of you instead? Something he enjoys doing? There are a million ways to celebrate without buying gifts. Cook him his favorite meal with a candlelight dinner, plan a cool, low cost date, etc. I think next time you should just put some more consideration into his feelings. "
Your husband is furious because he wants power and control. He has his power and control via the family finances. You went ahead and did something you wanted to do with the money without consulting him--because it was supposed to be a surprise for him! Loss of power & control=unhinged fury. 
"Look into the five ‚Äúlove languages‚Äù  
People have different ways to express and receive love. Gifts is one. Others are words of affirmation, gift of time, acts of service "
What's happening to all the money you're saving after your bills are paid?
this is.... exactly like Diane and Mr.Peanut Butter's relationship on Bojack Horseman
"Okay but being bad at gift giving is not giving a bad book title, it‚Äôs forgetting that that person likes books and giving them like a big stuffed animal or something. I see where you‚Äôre going because, yeah, spending too much money when you ask for a frugal gift is being stubborn and inconsiderate but I still don‚Äôt consider it as bad as yelling at someone and making her feel guilty. 

Also, she seemed to think that he would appreciate it. So, he didn‚Äôt express that he didn‚Äôt want an expensive gift but that HE doesn‚Äôt like to spend a lot of money, so she might not have made the connection. Which is, really, being bad at gift giving and maybe a little annoying but does not warrant that amount of frustration from him."
Wow. People that react like this to such nice gestures actually manage to get married? Sounds like he takes you for granted and there‚Äôs no reason for him to freak out over literally nothing. I feel bad for you that you‚Äôre married to such a douche bag. A dollar store mug with his name on it? What a fucking dork. 
"You didn‚Äôt do anything wrong, he‚Äôs being an asshole. Show him this thread so he knows how much of an asshole he is. Next time buy him one thing on his list."
"Wow he's mad about the gift but kept it, even though his issue is the money that you could have gotten it back?

Not sure what to do about that OP. It doesn't sound serious enough to go to counseling over but in this particular scenario he is being ungrateful and a brat.

Reminds me of the scene in Bojack Horseman where Mr. Peanutbutter makes Diane a ""Bell Room"" and instead of saying thank you she melts down and starts a fight over it because she hates grand gestures. "
You did nothing wrong. It sounds like you have more to talk about in therapy. I‚Äôm sorry this didn‚Äôt go the way you probably saw it going in your head. 
"In one way I can sort of understand your husband. I have huge problems and anxiety around receiving gifts, even if it's for christmas or my birthday. The more expensive the gift, the worse it gets and the more brain weasels I get. But it would never cross my mind to yell at anybody if they got me something expensive!

If you have shared finances and aren't in a tight position economically, I have a hard time understanding that part. Especially since he refused to let you take it back for a refund and was apparently just fine with drinking it?!"
"He's an idiot. Tell him you learned a lesson, and will never buy him another gift. Except maybe something from a Good Will store."
"I believe your husband has a project (something to buy or to do) but does‚Äônt have  money for it yet, you ‚Äùspending‚Äù the money hurts indirectly his project. 
you need to talk sbout personal plans, and why not have personal spending accounts, so if you buy something to him he knows that its coming from you own savings, no from the join saving account."
"Do you work? He said he will have to work overtime to earn back the money. This make it seems like you‚Äôre spending money that‚Äôs not yours on him, which is why he‚Äôs upset because he doesn‚Äôt need things he needs/wants money. That doesn‚Äôt mean his attitude is okay at all, you guys need to talk about boundaries, or why he‚Äôs upset more clearly. That kind of stingy money attitude puts a strain on a relationship. 

> I was the stingy one before "
"I went through some thing like  this with my boyfriend once I used his debit card by accident to take a uber to my job and he was furious.I just think that some men like to be cheap and I don't think u were wrong for trying to spoil him,but if u know that he doesn't like to squander money like that then u should have gotten him a cheaper gift. Remember its all about wat the person likes not wat u like ."
Can you earn the money to cover the gift? It sounds like he feels you spent too much of the money he worked hard to earn and now will have to work more. 
Who earned that money?

"Ugh, my ex spent $100 on flowers for an anniversary. Yes, I acted appreciative, but I was internally screaming inside that he spent that much on flowers.

Nope. Parents never spent any money but they made a lot. The ‚Äúwhat if‚Äôs‚Äù sound like him though. 
"This still wouldn't excuse his treatment of OP for getting him a gift. It's one thing to be concerned about money.

This guy is a huge jerk."
"Just to play devils advocate here, and I'm making some assumptions so please take into account this question is based off those assumptions.

Your comment reads like you find his reaction (raised voice... he communicated his reasons for displeasure and then later expanded on them) worse and in more need of therapy than ignoring your partners wishes and the fact they dont like spending money and spending money on them for their birthday? If I hated people spending money on me, and they spent money on me FOR MY BIRTHDAY I'm supposed to react calmly and controlled... when my wife literally did something I dont like on my birthday? Its... weird how most comments talk about his reaction. This is like buying your wife a vacuum for valentines.

What's passive aggressive about reacting, apologizing for your reaction, and then EXPLAINING why you've been in a bad mood all day (quiet) when asked?"
"Conversely, did his family teach him to show love through nonmonetary means?"
"This! If you guys are financially comfortable you should each have a designated amount of ""fun money"" in the budget every month to do what you want with, no questions asked by the other person. "
Why didn't he let her bring it back then? Why swill it down while berating her for buying it.
"I have to agree.  It was more a gift for her than for him.

The OP probably enjoys giving gifts but I also think the husband was very right in saying that it no way reflects what he values and wants.  The OP wanted to make an extravagant gesture more than she wanted to find a gift that would appeal to him.  He has every right to be dismayed by this, although yelling is inappropriate.

u/socksareevildb I think you need to think carefully about what happened.  You know your husband.  It's not a stretch for you to realize that expensive gifts will make him feel uncomfortable and even unhappy.  His reaction was remarkably strong, too.  So, what prompted it?

Are there concerns with how finances are being run in general?  Are you feeling constrained by his perhaps miserly attitudes towards spending?  Is he worried about you not being in sync regarding spending?  Do *you* feel neglected by limited/no gifts or feeling unable to gift in return?  Has there been unforeseen expenditures in the recent past? 

These are all things to consider.

For the future, I think you need to have a discussion with your husband about total budget for gifts.  Both for you and him.  Another discussion about overall budget and spending limits, as others have suggested, is also a good idea.  Maybe this will help in the future.

Practical considerations about finances aside, you probably need to discuss conflict resolution and how to better approach emotion laden issues in the future too.  Yelling is a very bad way of communicating and he needs to work on it.  As for you... I think he was being honest when he told you he was feeling pressured and ignored by the gift later on.  I think you need to work on seeing this from his perspective.  It's like the boyfriend buying his girlfriend for her birthday tickets to a sporting match he follows."
"And her husband is wrong, in that he's acting like a complete asshole.

A nice thank you, followed later by a conversation about finances, instead of ruining the gift, the thought, the day, and more, would have accomplished more without being unnecessarily obnoxious and inappropriate toward his wife."
"His love language probably isn‚Äôt gifts. Think hard about what it is and try to get him a gift he‚Äôd prefer‚Äîmaybe just a back massage from you and a nice dinner at home, or maybe a thoughtful $10 gift, or maybe just bake him a cake, or maybe just let him pick out a few movies to binge together for an evening. There are lots of alternatives for someone who doesn‚Äôt like expensive gifts.

He still shouldn‚Äôt be yelling at you. But maybe he‚Äôs frustrated if this is a pattern where you‚Äôve never acknowledged his love language or gift preferences? I‚Äôd still have a discussion about what prompted his outburst, and try to genuinely see it from his point of view. Hopefully he‚Äôll apologize too. "
"This is incorrect. OP knows her husband doesn't like having expensive gifts spent on him. He has made that abundantly clear throughout their relationship, yet went ahead and did it anyway. Being upset is an understandable reaction (although I agree he didn't have to yell). And he didn't give her the silent treatment, he was just ""quiet"" but then opened up right away when prompted and talked about the issue. This is a husband who is trying to communicate his wishes to a loving but seriously misguided wife who just doesn't seem to get it. Perhaps he could have handled it better, but OP is ultimately the one at fault for disrespecting the husband's wishes in the first place.

Fortunately, this isn't really a huge issue, and is something they should be able to work through pretty easily, if OP will just start paying more attention to what her husband wants, instead of only focusing on what she wants."

"Not to pick this apart, but if he is careful about funds, even when you do return things, you are wasting the time, car wear and tear, and gas to do it. So to drink it is probably not the best relative to the high alcohol price, but once it is home, it would cost to return it."
"But thats what he wanted this year. I can agree yelling wasnt the right response. But he may feel thats hes not being listened to and his wishes not  being respected. I told my wife 17yrs not to get me anything this yr and she respected my wishes. She said if i was gonna get her something she wanted a certain brand of pajamas. Guess what she got, yup those pjs. We both listened to eachother."

I gotta chime in here. Hubby spent too too much on flowers from a florist and I ended up with a collection of glass vases that I am sure the florist over charges for.

I don't know how to lead that horse to water, because not everybody is introspective to the degree that I am.

"What are your budgeting conversations like? Do you guys have shared financial goals and clearly outlined plans for how much money you need to save per month to reach them? If not, I'd really recommend it. You should also talk upfront about how much you each will be spending on fun money for yourselves and what the cap is for giving gifts. If he insists on ridiculously low amounts for these categories, point him again towards the savings plan and show the amount of money you have left over after covering saving and regular expenses. It's okay to be frugal, but I think he needs to be able to have deeper conversations about \*why\* you can't spend $90 on a birthday gift beyond just ""I said so"". "
"This is it. 

It's very, very hard to break the mentality of not spending money on yourself. While his reaction sounds extreme (yelling), it's somewhat understandable given past history."

"I'm going to tag on to your devil's advocacy here, because there was something else that stood out to me in the OP. OP states that she decided to ""go all out"" for his birthday because they don't spend money on dates, or her birthday, or her anniversary. That's an interesting way to describe her reasoning. 

OP, are you absolutely certain that you didn't do this to passive aggressively highlight the fact that he seems unwilling to spend any money on anything involving you or your relationship? I'm not suggesting that his reaction was appropriate (it wasn't), or that it's OK for him to refuse to go on dates with you or acknowledge your birthday or anniversary if those days are important for you (it isn't). Only throwing the question out there as an opportunity to analyze your own motivations."
"Yes, you should react calmly. Because you're a grown up. Yelling is never necessary."
"But it is worse, no? Yeah, it‚Äôs hurtful when a partner doesn‚Äôt give you gifts that you like but he yelled at her and tried to make her feel super guilty for buying him gifts. Not being good at gift-giving isn‚Äôt the same as trying to make someone feel guilty for an (I assume) innocent action. "
"I try not to yell at my partner in general, but I would *never* yell at them for giving me a gift, even if said gift highlighted differences in opinions. He acted terribly.

And let us be honest, if he *really* cared about the money, he would have agreed to return the bottle. But he did not do that. Instead he stewed, and, *on a different day*, said he would have to work overtime to make up for the cost of the bottle. The bottle he refused to return, and started drinking. Basically he got mad at OP, on a different day, for a made-up reason.

Nothing about what he did was normal. "
"This. 

Also- the statement of ‚Äúits not like we‚Äôre poor‚Äù doesn‚Äôt convey the whole financial picture... OP says there is debt and they are ‚Äúmiddle class‚Äù, but last I checked less than 10% of all ‚Äúmiddle class‚Äù people could afford 3 months of living expenses off of savings of faced with no income. Perhaps there is limited savings. Or worse none at all. Even though I make all the bills on time, I could still be living paycheck to paycheck.

As someone paying off debt (rather aggressively, actually) and trying to save, I can vouch for the husband‚Äôs reaction. My husband knows not to spend over x amount on me for holidays, especially from our joint accounts, because we‚Äôve made an agreement to pay off a, b and c before doing d, e and f as a team. Now, if my husband had bought got me an expensive gift and offered to return it, I would have said yes, but it possible that the idea of returning a food/drink would be weird.... 

I would communicate with your husband and get the financial parameters figured out. If you find out he is incapable of spending, that‚Äôs a totally different story... and would require much more communication about lifestyle goals. "

>  we don‚Äôt spend money on dates and our anniversary/my birthday  

so he's doing something she doesn't like on her birthday.  She didn't yell at him for that, and that's actually much more like ""buying your wife a vacuum for valentines.""

He's ignoring her wishes, too.  She wants them to do more for special days."
"I'm not defending his behavior. He's an asshole and a bully. But it's silly for her to be confused why he didn't like it. 

Unless he has a habit of being passive aggressive in the past, and saying ""Just get me a dollar store mug"" and then if she did, yell at her for not caring enough to know that's a crappy gift. If THAT'S what he's like, he's gaslighting her and abusive, and she should just leave. "

"of course, but these two already have/have had strains in their relationship. these things build up and can make a person feel sad, bitter, or hopeless even when the problems have seemingly been solved for a while. 

he overreacted by yelling, but he did nothing else wrong. he apologized for his reaction, ensured her that he did like the gifts, and then the next day explained why he was quiet when prompted. from my point of view, he can't exactly do much else to redeem himself after his overreaction. 

not to mention, 'ruining the day'? it's HIS birthday. yes, he overreacted and obviously really upset OP, but OP ignored a big wish of his ON HIS BIRTHDAY (this being not having money spent on him). OP ruined the day, at least partially, by choosing those gifts without at least discussing it with him first."
"This is why I hate the love language thing. So often people use it to justify bad behaviour in so many ways. There‚Äôs absolutely no reason to act like such an asshole for being given a relatively affordable gift.

You have a lot to think about. He isn't going to change. Even if you split the finances how will he act? Is being with someone who can't relax about money for one second gonna work out in the long run? What happens when kids are in the mix? If you stay you need separate finances and couples therapy as well. Walking on eggsells about money isn't a fun way to live.
I think the gesture of you personally covering the cost might have some meaning to him. Maybe pick up a tutoring gig? Or pet sitting? Some people can be very weird about spending and gifts. 
"> I make exactly the same amount as him.

And you share finances so he has to pay for half of a gift he never wanted.  You didn't buy him a gift so he would be happy, you bought him a gift so you could pat yourself on the back and feel good about yourself.  It was selfish of you to do this without giving him a heads up that you wanted to buy something to celebrate his birthday.  I'm sure you neglected to talk to him about it because you know he would have said no.  "

"I feel like her telling telling him 90$ is nothing is going to make the problem worse. He got upset because he feels unheard and ignored.  For her to emphasize that it's not a big deal, it would definitely make those feelings stronger."

Oban is a Scottish whiskey.
"There is a difference between being a spendthrift and imposing it on others.  I have a friend whose husband is an obsessive saver, like has her cut his hair and things like that, but he doesn't yell at her for getting her own hair professionally styled."
A spendthrift is someone who spends money extravagantly. OP's husband is quite the opposite.
"I don‚Äôt read it like a passive aggressive poke. I read it like someone with a compulsion freaking out because he had to try to ‚Äúfix"" the nonexistent problem.  It‚Äôs like someone with severe OCD would react if you made something ‚Äúdirty‚Äù. "
"Ok! thanks, and I do agree. I just had a knee jerk reaction and wanted to understand your comment better."
That‚Äôs exactly how I read it. 
"No, I took it to mean that she figured it would be acceptable since they‚Äôre technically ‚Äúsaving‚Äù by not spending on those other occasions. Plus she mentions they‚Äôre not poor, so it‚Äôs not like they don‚Äôt spend money on dates, etc. because they can‚Äôt afford it. 

I think they probably need to talk about their views on spending/gift giving in therapy. I understand the comments where people are saying she should know him well enough at this point to know that‚Äôs not something he‚Äôd want, and I can understand him feeling hurt that she doesn‚Äôt seem to know him or respect that. I also know that for some people, giving a nice gift is a way to express their love and appreciation for someone, and if you went to the trouble to do something you thought the other person would like (it‚Äôs not like she ‚Äúwent all out‚Äù and got concert tickets for an artist SHE really likes, where it would be more of a ‚Äúgift‚Äù for her, for example), I can understand being hurt when your partner‚Äôs first reaction is to yell. Sure, you could argue that her feeling good about giving a gift isn‚Äôt the priority here, but I‚Äôm just trying to say I don‚Äôt think she came from a bad place.

Think about it from the perspective that many have already addressed re: being wired to never want to spend money because that‚Äôs how you were raised, and how hard it is to break that mentality. I think in some sense, the same could be said for her giving nice gifts to show love/appreciation on someone‚Äôs birthday. If that‚Äôs how OP‚Äôs family always did things, it‚Äôs probably harder for her to break from that when her husband says he wants a dollar tree mug. Just saying this too because I know some people who are overly generous and always want to give, even when you tell them they don‚Äôt have to, it‚Äôs easier to just accept the gift because it‚Äôs thoughtful and they really want to. And like someone said earlier, they‚Äôre not poor, and it was $90. His reaction is akin to her ‚Äúgoing all out‚Äù and planning a $4000 weekend getaway. 

Just my two cents. TL;DR - Neither OP nor her husband had bad or selfish intentions, they just have different views on spending and gift-giving, and since that came to a head this year where feelings were hurt on both sides, they should probably talk about this in their couples therapy."
But its reddit so as long as you were offended and have the hivemind offended you CAN act like a child.
"Ignoring a fundamental ideal like ""please dont waste money on me"" is not being bad at gift giving. If I literally ask you not to do something on my birthday, and you literally do the thing 9 ask you not to THEN argue with me invalidating my feelings because you meant well...


Thats what really happened. Someone please explain why this is negative right now."
"Purposefully breaking a boundary isn't the same as being bad at gift giving.

Being bad at gift giving means being on the same page about what is and isn't appropriate. You both might agree a book is an appropriate gift, but you choose the wrong title.

Breaking boundaries means you're not on the same page. You might say 'its not appropriate for you to spend over 100 dollars on me.' and the person goes out and spends 90 dollars on a bottle of alcohol alone."

"After he exploded at her, she offered to take the gifts back, and he refused, and he said he loved it. Later he was reserved/silent, and then when prodded for why he was being quiet, he laid into her - not just trying to explain why he was upset, but accusing her of not knowing him, called it money wasted, and then decided to be a martyr to ""fix"" it.

So, the ""else"" he could have done is to treat her like his wife, rather than letting his emotions control him into treating her poorly.

If she knew he didn't want to be bought something expensive, I agree that she shouldn't have gotten him those gifts. That doesn't make either part of his reaction anywhere close to acceptable."

"Maybe this is a leap, and although we only have OP's side of the story here, I suspect he didn't even ""yell"" as she claimed. He doesn't sound like someone who normally yells from the rest of the story. He probably just raised his voice an appropriate amount when he realized how disrespectful she was being, and then she burst into tears because she's emotional (we already know there's a disconnect here). And now in retelling the story is making it sound worse than it was. He apologized immediately afterward when he saw her reaction, and was a little hesitant to mention it again since he clearly has to walk on eggshells around her. Thankfully she brought it up, and he tried discussing it rationally. Honestly, the husband sounds like a pretty reasonable person for wanting to work through all this with someone like OP. She's lucky to have him."
"Can you actually return liquor? Obviously not if it's been opened, but can you return it unopened? I have literally never heard of anyone even attempting to do this, and the idea strikes me as ridiculous on its face, but lots of people are using this to say that the money wasn't an issue, so maybe it's more of a possibility than I thought."
"I notice she's avoiding that one, but the overtime comment makes me think he's the sole wage earner or at least the primary by far"
"""Can be""- exactly. It doesn't mean it is. He has been very clear about what he consents to financially, and she is ignoring it. They're not compatible about this because they have different preferences. It's not necessarily abuse when your preferences don't align. She could have tutored for a few hours, sold some stuff, etc. to make it from her pocket book alone, but she used their funds. To me, it's incompatibility, but if you wanted to make the argument, it's more likely she's abusing him by making him fund things he doesn't want for her enjoyment. 

But that's ridiculous. No one is cutting up cards, keeping someone from leaving the house, working, etc. They don't agree on how to spend funds. Golddigging and thrifty work when you're aligned with your partner; when you're not on the same page, you get this crap.

**Do want to add, not cool to yell on his part. I'm wondering if it's come to that if she's aware that he doesn't want it, as in her post, and she does it anyway."

"I don't drink much due to medication and I still think alcohol is way more useful than plants that are gonna die in a week.

And I think my life choices are awesome."
"Right? Or at least he could acknowledge different people like different things, lol. People on reddit always have such a lack of self awareness about that. "
I'm glad someone else noticed this it sounds a lot like an obsession with not spending money rather than just being frugal. 
"Reading into the situation a little bit more, it sounds like OP was excited for an opportunity to do something nice because her partner doesn't like to seen money spent on any occasion. Nothing for anniversaries, nothing for her birthday.

Even if he isn't big into gifts, his reaction was pretty mean-spirited. Saying ""Great, now I have to work overtime"" is basically the same as ""fuck you"". Either its hyperbole aimed to hurt her feelings, or her partner is hiding financial trouble from her. I understand it's frustrating to get if you really hate it, but that doesn't mean you should be a jerk about it.

 Also, given that he made a negative comment as he got the gifts and later after he had time to think about it kinda shows that he doesn't really care what her intentions were. Being disappointed in the moment then smoothing things out later is one thing, and so is accepting the gifts and saying ""Hey, remember how I said no gifts?"" later is one thing, but continuing to harp on isn't good communication. "
"Because it's not what really happened.  The husband never specifically said ""please don't spend money on me"" and they never really talked about limits for spending, until *after* the fact, when he said he'd have been happier with a $1 mug.  

It sounds more like he just generally has a bad/sour attitude towards spending money, and she was just kind of going along with it so as not to rock the boat, but then decided to show her love by spending a little more.  There was never any actual boundary set.   "

Are all of your finances shared? How do you decide how and when to buy major purchases? Are there typically any dollar limits to what one person can buy without checking in with the other person? Are your savings dedicated to any goals or purpose that you‚Äôve now taken money away from?"
"You each make 45k, or you make 45k combined?"
"I'm not disagreeing with you. Ironically, I'm asking you to do the same thing: understand nuance. 

We don't have all of the information here, but even still, the automatic assertion of abuse based on a rejected gift, besides being naive, isn't helping."
He apologized pretty quickly im not sure how long theyve been married but after a while you know your mates likes dislikes and wants and needs. If he's the type thats not into spending lavishly one himself he won't want her to either 
"I mean, I guess it will, but if she feels like the car is a mess it'll feel to her like he's riding around in a garbage dump, which isn't something you want for your loved ones."
If that was true then he still needs to grow up and realize that jeopardizing your entire relationship over a relatively minor amount of money is a stupid move. 
"Screaming at someone over a gift is abusive behavior. He may not be making it a full tilt abusive relationship, but his action this time is abusive. The way he acted is not acceptable, regardless of his frugality. Obviously she sticks to his frankly ridiculous budgeting all the rest of the time. If he didn‚Äôt like it, he could have responded calmly like a normal person. He‚Äôs an adult, he can act like an adult, instead he decided to act like a mean, pissy baby. "
"Irrelevant to the point that he didn‚Äôt say ‚Äúget me nothing‚Äù and knowing that your partner is frugal doesn‚Äôt mean you automatically think ‚Äúwell, better get him a dollar store mug‚Äù. She wanted to do something nice. If he didn‚Äôt like it he could have had a way better reaction. Look we clearly disagree, and my comment was more for the OP. So I‚Äôll leave it at we disagree"

Any boundary breaking is a relationship ending behavior.
"He didn't respond appropriately, sure. Yelling is not ok. Spending money that is not yours is also stealing. An instance does not make a pattern, and although a pattern isn't needed to decide to leave, there is more here than just the guy blowing up or a gal stealing from her guy. "
We agree that he had a bad reaction. Everything else can be speculation. Op and hubby need a bit more communication so theyre both on the same page.
"Have you ever had a car detailed? It's more than just ""cleaning""."
Or he could have cleaned his own damn car himself.
"Okay? He didn't end the relationship. He lashed out verbally instead. I think it would be perfectly fine for him to break up with her if it truly bothers him so much.

I hope they do break up, because it doesn't sound like either is getting what they want out of the relationship. "
"She's not stealing from him, for Gods sake. They're MARRIED. They both work and make equal amounts of money. 

All of these ""oh yeah, he yelled *but*"" posts are so annoying. Bonus annoying points for calling her selfish, etc. Double bonus points for making shit up the way you are."

"Being upset that people disagree and resorting  to cursing for lack of an argument doesn't help to make one.    

Nonetheless, being married doesn't give you the right to spend common funds without consulting your spouse (or having a set rule in lieu of it), particularly when a spouse says don't do it, for you to do it anyway. If you both work and make equal money, then waste your own funds."
Professional deep cleaning with equipment you don't own and would be way more expensive to buy than hiring a pro who already has the stuff.
"My argument was fine, yours is the senseless one. Not only senseless but completely made up. So in the future you may want to address that. 

That's quite frankly bullshit that you always need to consult your spouse before spending money, especially if you both make the same amount of money. I've been married for 30 years and don't do that, and I don't know anyone who does that because that would be ridiculous. A marriage is supposed to be a partnership. He isn't her father or any sort of authority figure. They're equals.

You have some strange and toxic ideas about relationships and marriage. Honestly you don't really have any business giving advice. Thanks, and good bye."
"Equals mean equal say. It's courteous if you are spending money that isn't all yours to run it by those whose funds you are spending. You may even have a rule, like, when it's over X amount or whatever. Even if you earn the same amount or none of it, respecting your spouse enough to not go and spend when they asked you not to seems like a good idea. We just disagree on whether respect for your spouse extends to respecting funds."
"Most couples I know have some kind of limits on shared funds. Like, you check in before spending more than X amount.

Just because you‚Äôre equals, you don‚Äôt drain the accounts to buy a new car without talking to your partner...

Edit: I‚Äôm not implying that she bought a car. I‚Äôm saying that ‚Äúreal partners don‚Äôt discuss their expenses‚Äù doesn‚Äôt really seem functional..."
"She didn't buy a new car, she got a car detailed and bought a bottle of liquor. 

If my husband wanted me to ask permission to spend a few hundred dollars I'd ask him for a divorce. Nobody does that unless they're a control freak or finances are super tight."
Nothing you do will ever be right for her. You aren‚Äôt on the lease. You should go. Cut contact. 
"Get on that plane. Yes, you're not faultless in the situation--but at minimum, this woman doesn't bring out the best in you. We sometimes sink (or rise) to the level of our partners, and it seems like this is happening here. She has a lot of growing up to do, and your own personal growth is only going to be stunted if you stay with her. You don't have to hate her to leave her; this is probably better for you both. "
Get out while you can.
Ask yourself why it is that you need to leave in order for her to decide to be a decent human being. And then ask yourself if you trust that this magical behavior change would actually last.
This is some serious psychodrama. Please get out of there ASAP. 
">I don't know what to do.

Stay broken up.  This relationship is dysfunctional."
"Talk is cheap. Watch her actions and don‚Äôt listen to her words. 

Think with your head right now. Reread your post and realize how much drama has gone down in this dysfunctional relationship. It‚Äôs full of toxic behaviors.

Change doesn‚Äôt happen overnight. Individual therapy might be needed, as well as couple‚Äôs counseling to learn healthy conflict resolution and communication skills. It could take a while, and success isn‚Äôt guaranteed, because there isn‚Äôt some pill that magically cures the relationship. Both people have to work to keep the relationship afloat. But the problem is that your relationship has sunk to the bottom of the ocean....the toxic behaviors have made you guys resentful and loss of respect has happened. 

Lastly, I don‚Äôt really trust people‚Äôs offers to change after the breakup has happened. It‚Äôs easy to be like ‚ÄúI will do anything to keep the relationship alive‚Äù when the rug has been pulled out from underneath you. If this relationship had any hope of being revived, you guys would have had this come-to-Jesus talk way before an actual breakup."
Get on the plane home. I was in the same situation recently- I sat at the airport considering missing my flight to stay with him. I know how hard it is to leave. You will be better off if you get out though. 
"This isn‚Äôt just about sex. She‚Äôs shutting down as a person. Does she have friends? Interests outside the home? Any kind of support network? 

How about instead of a you working for a promotion (which will most likely require you working *more* hours and add more stress) you shut down that blog of hers? She‚Äôs actively losing  money and costing you hundreds of dollars. She wants to go to Europe? Start by saving money with the blog. 

You could send your kid to some baby groups even once a week, it‚Äôll help you get in touch with new parents and might give you tips on how to deal with stressors and make you feel not so isolated. "
"Counseling could help, but if she won't go another option is to work through a good book on message together. Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work by Gottman might be a good one to choose, or maybe His Needs, Her Needs. I'd back off on trying to initiate sex and instead work on building your relationship with your wife. She will need to feel more connected to you and cared for before she'll have an interest in sex. 

She also sounds like she's isolated or possibly depressed. Could you approach her with concern for her well-being and encourage her to see a doctor?"
"Having a 1 year old baby is stressful. Being the primary caregiver is draining. Your wife likely feels touched out and resents that you get to sit in a nice office with other adults for most of the day, while she deals with a screaming toddler.

What I would suggest is that you do a daddy-baby activity for a few hours on each weekend day to leave your wife in the house alone. Alone time will help her recharge. It sounds like she never really has any time alone. 

Rely more on your extended network. Do you have any family or friends who can babysit? Can you do alternating babysitting nights every week, so you and your wife can go on a date and reconnect?

There is absolutely a way to save this relationship. Don't throw this away over these honestly minor issues. I know they sound major to you, but this is what every single couple goes through in the first year of having a baby. Every single one. Every new parent feels like they're the one doing more, and they resent the shit out of the other party. The way you feel about your wife? She feels it about you too. 100&#37; normal for new parents. 

Rage quitting a relationship rather than talking it out is the easy way in the short term, because you get to feel like you're in the right. You build up a million reasons why the other person is destroying you, then get divorced still feeling like you are the victim and the wronged party -- plus, you get to avoid the truly difficult parts of marriage, which aren't the problems, but working through the problems. But that's no way to live -- it's a pattern that will take away every relationship you get into 1 or 2 years in."
">I'm at a point where I feel there is no way to save this relationship.

I agree. 

>I think I would have asked for a divorce already if it weren't for our baby. 

You want your baby growing up thinking this is what a relationship looks like?  Get out now and find someone you are more compatible with.  "
"Okay, a bit of a buried lede: a one year old baby! 

Is she breastfeeding or ""baby wearing""? Even if she's not, taking care of a small child is ultra 'touchy' and she's probably ""touched-out"" at the end of the day. A few hours here and there isn't enough. New parents describe the lack of sleep and constant worry and need to be ""on"" as a kind of torture mixed with being ground down to a shell of who you were. Many marriages report being *significantly* less happy and only go back to former happiness when the kid is 18 (and/or gone!)

Maybe she's *scared* to have sex with you because she doesn't want another child! Do you guys have a birth control plan in place? If so, you need to *majorly* step up your child care game: baby sitter, mother in law, mom, someone needs to come in there and help a LOT more, so your wife can focus on herself. I'd also encourage her to join play groups or consider ""drop in"" day care when she can. 

The baby is the issue, I feel like. "

"She won't shut down her blog. She has this grand dream that it will turn into a big thing and we will be able to live off of it. 

Her sister lives in the same city as us, but that's it. "
"She had a baby a year ago, seems super overwhelmed, and has anxiety. She may need some personal therapy, you guys should get some therapy together, but this is TOTALLY something that can be worked through. 

Divorce is not the only option AT ALL. It takes a while to get back to yourself after having a baby, certainly more than a year, and it‚Äôs normal for people to go through bad phases in their life in general.

Therapy, working out together, healthy eating, and a little bit of patience through the early baby years. Marriage is tough but your wife doesn‚Äôt sound like she isn‚Äôt trying, she seems like she feels guilty and overwhelmed and like she wants to get away from it all. Common feelings. Normal feelings. 

Why does everyone on reddit advocate for divorce at the smallest things. Goddamn. "

"I said ‚Äúit‚Äôs normal for people to go through bad phases in their life in general‚Äù and it is. She clearly has some mental health issues that need to be worked on and that can be exaggerated by having a baby. They don‚Äôt need a divorce. Getting married is also really stressful. The beginning of marriage and childbearing is a hard fucking time but you don‚Äôt just leave when the going gets tough.

"Your dad is abusive. LoveIsRespect.org has good resources for both you and your mom.

When school is back in session, talk to a trusted adult about this behavior."
Just the fact that she continues to hang out with you says something. Just ask her!
"Dude, you said you've been dating this girl for a month. If that's the case, you need to open up the lines of communication with her, and ask her straight up what she's feeling and thinking about the two of you as an item. If a  womans actions aren't speaking loud enough for me, then I cut the bullcrap and ask her what she is wanting out of the relationship. You know she's shy and yet you wonder why she hasn't made a move, really bruh? "
"Unless she's dumb, she knows what's going on. And someone told you she is quite shy. There's pretty much only one way of figuring out, and is not by asking people on the internet.  :)

Try to be subtle, but clear enough."
"Here's the deal. Don't initiate contact with her. Don't ask her out. Wait for her to approach YOU. I know it can be difficult to contain yourself, but that's the only way to know. Don't confess that you like her. I repeat, DO NOT tell her you like her. Wait for her to initiate that conversation. Have her guessing. Be a little more distant in your conversations, but don't lose your ground. Be strong.

And I know you don't wanna hear this, but you can put a timeline on your ""dating"".

Does she always accept your invitations without hesitation? Does she come up with excuses or does she immediately accept?

If she does immediately accept, then she likes you, and you need to make a move. You need to move faster with this girl. Create the atmosphere for a romantic situation(I'm not talking candles and such). You need to engage her to feel that attraction. Pay attention to her body language and the amount of energy she invests in your conversations.

If you need to talk this out, I'm here."
"Thanks bro, I needed to hear that"
"I know, I feel dumb. I just can't stop thinking about it ,I have never felt like this before"
"I was thinking in waiting to her to invite me. Yes, she always accepts my invitations (she takes some hours, the first time a complete day, but she answers positively). My issue here is that I am always the guy proposing the plan. Last time I gave her like 4 options and she just said ""ok, I will think of other options too"" but gave not real interest in my opinion. That same day I told her I was at this bar near my university and she appeared with some friends an hour later (kinda weird). I asked her if she really wanted to have the date because I felt she did not, and she said ""yes, I want to"". We talked for 10 min and she left (I would have really liked her to stay and be with me a little bit more). That night she gave me 3 options and I picked one. I want to go faster, this game feels really odd. My ex was really intense, she always wanted to hang out. Maybe I am not used to go so slow with someone.
I had this plan to invite her to a lookout, have a picnic (food made by me), and just chill in a picnic cloth and talking. I want to give her a kiss or something, idk. Our dates have been dinner, and some art event at my town."
"It's normal, emotions tend to cloud our judgement. ;)

EDIT: 1. It's also normal not to have something interesting to talk about.

2. Some people also take more ""time"" to open up."
"Alright, that's a good plan. See how it goes and you can decide for yourself whether you want to proceed or not. Good luck on your date!"
"If someone does not put in the effort to be a part of your family, you can't make them. It's the bitter, sad truth. Yes, he *should*. He may come to regret this in his later years - and if he does, you can deal with that when the time comes. For now, focus on giving your lovely daughter the joy of being around family who *wants* to be with her. I guarantee that will be enough. I had very little family growing up, but the few I did have, plus my mother's closest friends, were more than enough for me to feel loved. :)"
"Confrontation never gains anything of use.

A short, simple message is better. State that you're tired of the crap (politely though), and that until he is able to keep his word, you won't be bothering to initiate any plans or contact.

Just that, nothing more. You can't get closure because he isn't going to be ready to face himself honestly. You aren't going to change his behaviour because he isn't ready or willing to change.

So your only healthy option is to put the ball in his court and not make any adjustments to your life for him. If he wants to schedule visits, calls, etc it needs to be on your schedule, at your convenience. That way if he keeps being unreliable, nothing is lost. But it still gives him the opportunity to change if he is willing to."
"A confrontation won't work with someone who doesn't value and respect you; it'll be like yelling at a wall. I know all about it; my father-in-law is exactly like this, albeit with even less contact (like, maybe 3-4 times a year). This is a situation where you need to be looking after your and your child's well-being. Your father has made his choice, and it isn't you.

I suggest going straight to no contact. Boundaries only work when you have leverage over the other person, and he's already shown numerous times that he doesn't respect you. I would send one final message to him, informing him or your decision. Also say that if he wants to even have a chance at repairing the relationship, then he needs to give you a genuine apology for the disrespect he's shown you and your family over the years. Keep some form of communication open that he can use to contact you for that apology, but block him everywhere else, and don't answer any of his messages unless they start with ""I'm sorry for disrespecting you."""
Just cut all contact with him. He does not deserve an explanation. Your daughter deserve s to have family that want to be invovled.
"My dad did the exact same thing, except I have a son. Confronting him does nothing; he  is not going to change, and you are not going to get closure from it. Therapy helps. Living your life well and spending time with people who love you also helps."
"It‚Äôs not healthy for you or your daughter for you to be hanging onto every little scrap of attention that he tosses your way. Would you want your daughter to put up with this behavior from anyone? Would you want her chasing after crumbs of affection from people who couldn‚Äôt care less about her?

There‚Äôs no point in a confrontation. He‚Äôll react to you the exact same way he did to your sibling. The man that you miss -the man from your childhood- is gone. He‚Äôs just not there anymore. Mourn what you lost and what you should have gotten but never did and then move on. Think of him as deceased if you have to. Just rip the bandaid off and cut contact. I‚Äôm sorry that your dad did this."
"""I was ok with him blowing me off, but I will not allow him to blow off my daughter. I don‚Äôt want to lose him as a dad but has he really even been a dad? Will he ever change? Is there anything I can say to change him? I don‚Äôt want my daughter to lose a grandpa, but is it more harmful that he keeps blowing her off? She‚Äôll be old enough for it to upset her in a couple of years.""

Right now, your child doesn't know ""grandpa."" What she doesn't know, she won't miss. Maybe she'll be jealous of the other kids, but probably not. I grew up with a grandparent like this, and it wasn't a big deal. In fact, my entire extended paternal family was like this. Both of my grandparents; four of my aunts. We saw them when we saw them and we didn't when we didn't. It wasn't a big deal; my expectations were tempered because of my upbringing. I never expected the ""TV family"" support from them, and it didn't hurt me when I didn't get it.

If you try to force your dad to get his shit together, your kid is going to get hurt like you were. Your kid is going to get blown off, disappointed, and skipped out on. If you let your dad do his thing and stop trying with him, that will understandably hurt for you, but your child won't care. Your child will grow up under whatever circumstances are normal; if grandpa not being around is normal, then anything more than that is a nice surprise but just the status quo won't hurt.

I think you need to confront your emotions about your father.  Not necessarily through a confrontation *with* your father, but that's yp to you. If you do confront him, be honest to yourself about why. The confrontation is about him being a shitty parent, not a shitty grandparent. I think you're projecting a lot of hurt and pain and worry on a one year old child. You miss your father because you remember what he was like before, and what he was to your sister (and thus, what he potentially could have been to you). You know his hypocrisy and were accidentally entangled in the divorce after you saw his phone. That hurts. You're mourning the father you could have had; the one you wanted and deserved. And now you're mourning the grandfather you wish your child had.

Your child will never get the grandfather you want for them. Even if you somehow kick your dad's ass into gear, he will never be what you want him to be. He has proven over the years he isn't capable of it. You can't control his actions, only your own, and that means you have to take control of the situation by setting boundaries and disallowing your father's dumb shit to impact your child. Your child can grow up ignorant of the pain you're feeling; even now, I can't really relate to my father's pain towards his family. I know it's there, and I care, but *I* don't have that same pain. He protected me from that by making sure his family couldn't hurt me the way they hurt him.

Don't allow your father to disappoint you. Easier said than done, obviously. But you need to take control of the situation and examine your own feelings. You're scared he won't change - he probably won't. And if he does change, that change needs to be genuine and come from within, not from *you*."
Just move on.  It's hard but yeah.
"You have to face the fact they you don't have a real father. You happen to be associated with an egocentric douchebag who just donated his sperm cells ~28 years ago.

That being said, he will ALWAYS put his own wishes, desires and needs in front of his family and you will continously end up drawing the short straw, regardless of how much you try.

He might have good times or bad times, but he'll always end up being crappy and disappointing father. 

I'm saying this from my own first hand experience.

Cut him off. Let him know that he's not desired in your life. If your daughter asks one day when she gets older, tell her the truth about her grandfather. 

You both deserve not to have him in your life. "
"I think you should just cut him. Off he doesn't deserve you. 

"
"I never knew my paternal grandfather. I‚Äôve never met any of my family on my father‚Äôs side, actually, which is a combination of the fact that they don‚Äôt live in the same country as I do and the fact that many of them are less than stand-up family members. I don‚Äôt miss them. I know they exist and maybe someday I‚Äôd like to meet my cousins, but I don‚Äôt feel as though I missed out on knowing my grandparents or aunt and uncles because I have a family who have been there for me ever since I was a kid. 

Your daughter may someday want to meet her grandfather, but give her the family that she needs to support her and she won‚Äôt feel like she missed out on a thing. "
"Has he been a Dad? Yes. Doesn't seem he has much interest in it these days, and can't say I blame him, but don't be dramatic (sounds like part of what pushed him away from you to begin with). Sounds like he got burned out on family life and wanted to spend some time on himself. Sounds like you were a difficult child to raise, and drained a lot of energy and will from him. You sound pretty entitled. He's not obligated to stay married or go to counseling for a marriage he doesn't want to be in.

If he's not putting in the effort, you should stop too, but don't try to make sense of or dictate how he lives his life. Sounds like he did a good job of raising you, and that's really all you're owed. "
No it's not worth it to confront him.  Just stop contacting him.
It was 8 years ago. Dont you have better things to do?
"Thank you for your advice! It‚Äôs good to know that the family my daughter does have around her will be enough, like it was for you. :)"
"> Confrontation never gains anything of use.

That's definitely a vast overgeneralization, and not helpful advice to people who are conflict-averse and therefore fail to communicate about things that are bothering them.

(I think in this case it's probably true, though.)"
"Thank you for the advice! That‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been doing for the most part, I just haven‚Äôt told him that it‚Äôs up to him if he wants to be in my life."
Thank you for the advice. I like the idea of leaving the door open for him to communicate when he‚Äôs ready to genuinely apologize.
Thank you for the advice!
"Thank you for the advice! I think therapy might be the best option as far as healing goes, because I don‚Äôt think I will get closure from him."
"Thank you for your advice! I was afraid to cut contact with him, as I felt it was being petty and would just upset me. But after reading all these comments and yours, I realize it‚Äôs more damaging to me and my family to continue the way we communicate- on his terms."
"Thank you so much for this, this was everything I needed to hear. You‚Äôve pointed out a lot of things that I was blind to or that I didn‚Äôt want to admit to myself. The fact that you were in my daughter‚Äôs situation and weren‚Äôt hurt from it brings me comfort. 

You‚Äôre right that I was projecting my hurt on my daughter. She doesn‚Äôt even know him and I‚Äôm worried she‚Äôll be hurt when in reality, I‚Äôm the one who‚Äôs hurting. You hit the nail on the head.

I think the best I can do now is confront my emotions either in therapy or talking to a friend. And as far as my daughter goes, protect her like you said by setting boundaries. I can only hope that he‚Äôll snap back to who he was or should be, but until then I have to take care of myself and my family. Thank you again. This was very helpful!"
The mid life crisis and divorce were 8 years ago. The issues I‚Äôd like to confront him about have been ongoing. Clearly you didn‚Äôt read the entire post. 
"I know what you mean. It‚Äôs an easy thing to say but a hard thing to do, even when it‚Äôs the right thing to do. Hearing someone validate your choice helps to work through the denial and guilt. It really is a loss in it‚Äôs own right. 

From one child of a deadbeat to another: You‚Äôve got this. You‚Äôll get through it and then both you and your awesome little family will be better off for it."
"You say you aren't the jealous type, but you describe a pattern of behavior that is... quite jealous - of people on facebook, of celebrities, of athletes she notices.

The only issue is the double standard in your relationship. You should have equal expectations when it comes to jealousy, and it's clearly wrong for her to do/say things that she would be angry about if you were to say/do them. The next time you talk about it, I would focus on that. Make her understand that it is unreasonable to hold you to a different set of standards than she is held to herself."
"I think most millennials today will say you are jealous and have an unhealthy attitude, blah.  I don't believe your feelings are invalid.

I think you take your relationships seriously , have defined standards for what a committed relationship look like, and want to see the same reciprocity of values.

Frankly, no matter how perfect someone is otherwise, if they do not share the same relationship values as me, I wouldnt even be in a relationship to begin with.  

Since you are already dating for awhile, I believe it will have to be you who will need to change , or compromise your values. I do not foresee her losing Facebook or Instagram. Nor do I foresee her stop forging an amicable relationship with her ex's , without her greatly resenting you.  

It is clearly a case of mismatched values in a relationship.  

They say relationships are about compromises, but I say, if it bothers you this much to post about it on Reddit, you want to make sure you have upfront discussions about relationship expectations in the future (when dating again), and be willing to walk away from it. Life is too short to harbor resentments if it can be avoided."

"> I obviously don‚Äôt care about since it was before we met and I‚Äôm not that guy that will be jealous over something like that.

I don‚Äôt think this is true at all. Regardless I think it‚Äôs a good sign when someone is on good terms with their exes."
"I‚Äôm of the camp that as long as your partner is open, honest, and respectful in their relationships with former flames, it‚Äôs not a big deal. If she‚Äôs been transparent about these friendships (and it sounds like she has been) then I think this is an insecurity issue that it‚Äôs not really fair to put on your girlfriend. I‚Äôd try to work on these issues individually, perhaps with the help of a therapist. "
I hope my OP didn‚Äôt portray that. It is exactly as you said - the double standard. I‚Äôm not jealous or threatened from social media or celebrities (that would be ridiculous). 
Thank you for the honest response. I feel so trapped in that I can‚Äôt even talk about this stuff without being called a bigot or unreasonable. Thank you for not invalidating my concerns.

You said repeatedly that her comments make you angry and uncomfortable.
"No I get you.

I think in a relationship , one has to forgo the ego , and do what is in the best interest of the relationship. Pretty damn difficult in an age of ME! ME! ME!

We live in a time where we have an app, a solution, for everything.  We do not know how to suffer, what it means to sacrifice , and the benefit that those unpleasant, undesirable acts can bring .... like, building a character or strengthening a bond of a relationship.

Social commentary aside, don't buy into the labeling.  Your agitations are not borne out of irrationality.  Many relationships have blown up over permissive behaviors, and not respecting boundaries valued by both people.  I don't get why most people want to be ""exclusive"" relationships when its clearly not feasible for their personality but that's another topic lol

"This is tough to hear and definitely needs to be heard. I can see your life... and it hasn‚Äôt been what it should be, and when these experiences happen they hinder our future. I myself have gone through things that have hindered my ability to make friends, to talk to new people, hell, even post on reddit. But all I know is that there is that one day where life changes, where it turns, where all the hardship and the unfairness comes back. I hope things start to look better "
"Thank you so much. I have my positive moments when I try to be optimistic. Of course, everything isn‚Äôt bad 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. I‚Äôm just feeling it all right now and this happens a lot :( I‚Äôm trying to work on it so I guess even that is a start. Thank you for this."
Keep it as friends. She said the relationship wasn't the best for her mental health; shes probably working her way through a lot of hurt and possibly trauma and needs time- and friends! The last she probably wants is a co-worker she thought was just a friend hitting on her. 
You are probably right. Another guy from our work was flirting with her. And they use to be friends but she doesn‚Äôt like him anymore. I sometimes compliment her but I try to make it seem not to flirty.
"Never, ever date someone from work as a man. Potential to get #metoo'ed is way too high, at best you'll lose your job/career."
I mean I work at a mediocre restaurant as a server. Hopefully it wound end up as my career if I can get through college.
What happens when you can't use that job on a resume in the future? Work experience is more important than degrees in most fields these days...just looking out for ya buddy!
Yeah I know man. Thank you.
Just see how it goes. Good luck! 
"I feel you. Same thing happened to me only we were married. Once a woman says she no longer wants to be with you, that's it. There is pretty much zero chance of fixing this. It sucks and is honestly one of the toughest pains you can feel in life. 

Stop talking to her, start focusing on a life for yourself. Be thankful you're out of this before children and commingling of funds"
"It's funny you say that because I actually had her in mind for marriage, despite the cons in the relationship. But you're absolutely right--this could have been a lot more complicated and difficult. Thanks, friend. "
Well he already knows it. You aren't required to invite him or hangout with him if you dislike his presence.
"Just give it time! I had a similar relationship with my sister. As we matured into adults, the childhood stuff didnt matter any more. Then our mother died and we really started to appreciate each other (I'm sure you don't need a death in the family for this to happen!)

We're now best friends. We do everything together and talk every day.

Don't force it. Show your sister your love for her, then let her come to you when she's ready "
"I have clinical depression and spend a lot of time in my own head. People tend to think I am a little odd at times, but things that happened ten years ago can feel as real as yesterday. It might come from being creative, but I have a vivid imagination. So those memories can feel like I am in them. The downside, I guess. 

That being said, I left my hometown for two years and just had a break from everything. It helped a lot. It was easier to unpack everything if I didn't see the people who caused the anxiety in the first place. After two years, I returned home and here I am, feeling a lot less depressed and anxious and apathetic about everything. 

So I suggest you give your sister time. You both are still young enough that you'll likely rekindle. Maybe you won't. But she isn't wrong to feel what you did as a child hurt her. She probably feels the same way a lot of twins do, that you got away with things, that she was overlooked, that you were cruel and it damaged her. 

Even if you were young when it happened, it doesn't take away the fact that it did. I think that is important to understand. You did things to her as a child that caused her to internalize your behavior. Whether we should give a child a pass doesn't matter, because it matters to her. 

And you cause her pain.

So I would write her back saying, ""You are important to me and I am horrified that I hurt you. I would like to have you in my life and in whatever way you think that is possible let me know. I would like to talk in six months to a year to see if we can talk this out, but if that's not something you feel comfortable with I understand."" 

Then let her make the choices."
This is way too much for Reddit. You need professional help and support 
"You should never marry someone who is unstable like that. Her commitment to you wasn‚Äôt stable or sound and I think you married her out of fear.  

Does she need longer term hospitalization for her own safety?  Maybe

Do you need an exit strategy from this fiasco of a marriage?  Yes.  "
"> After that she hated me even more, and wanted to go find people to fuck so I would hate her enough that I wouldn't stop her when she tried to kill herself again

> She came out and told me that for the past 8 months she has been unable to shake the idea of fucking other people and then dying as her sexual fantasy, and sex with me is just something she does so I will be happy, but making her resentful now.

Document everything with dates and times in case of divorce. If there's text message proof make sure to keep it.

She needs to see a psychiatrist and get on medication."
"Sorry to say most people don't cope with situations like this, because most people don't get into them in the first place. Her issues were well known to you, and it was naive to basically think ""well, that's as bad as it can ever get, let's get married"". She needs intensive therapy - there's very little that you can do, because this is way beyond the capacity of non-professionals to handle. Sounds like she's not remotely interested in maintaining your marriage, so you have to start thinking about whether you are. One person can't save a relationship alone, and if the relationship is doomed, you have to take some steps to protect your own mental health, not get dragged down with her. Therapy for yourself would be a start, partly to cope with this situation, and also to figure out why you have so little self respect and awareness that you ever ended up in this situation. "
"So I have bipolar and it took me about a decade to get to a place where I was stable (without medications). It‚Äôll likely take her just as long if not longer because having BPD as well complicates things. You can‚Äôt fix her mental illness for her, and things aren‚Äôt going to get better overnight. As much as it sucks, I think divorce is the best thing you can do to protect yourself. You can still keep in contact with her, but she doesn‚Äôt seem to be in a place where marriage is something she can handle and staying together will only make your life miserable too. I know that you made a commitment to her, but it doesn‚Äôt sound like you understood the gravity of the situation at the time. Does she have siblings or other family members that you can reach out to for help? Whatever you decide to do, you shouldn‚Äôt do it alone. I also recommend seeing a therapist that specializes in bipolar and BPD to talk to about this. "
"This is a different kind of abuse, but it is still abuse."
"There is no way to win with this. You don‚Äôt have to stay with someone who drives you up the wall, whether or not they‚Äôre doing it deliberately. 

If you‚Äôve tried talking calmly to him about it when he‚Äôs not being annoying, and nothing has changed, there‚Äôs nothing for it but to leave. You can‚Äôt stay in a situation where one of you keeps getting violent."
What should I do? i am at a loss on how to handle this
"Thank you for your reply. How should I approach talking to him calmly, I don‚Äôt want to mess this relationship up, nor do I want it to continue this way, as I said other than these incidents he is everything I have hoped for. i just don‚Äôt know how to deal with this at al."
"If you feel like you're mom after 4 months, it's time to get out. "
"That's weird that he doesn't brush his own teeth or wash his hands--and that you have to nag him to do it... so weird.

Does his family also not brush their teeth or wash their hands?"
Lol he's a kid. Gotta leave him.
"Yikes he sounds like a loser, I would say go and enjoy your birthday with just your friends.  19 is wayyy too old to require parental guidance on finances and basic hygiene.  I understand the whole ""we get along so well"" but you'll be fine finding a guy that you get along with that also has the capacity to be clean and a responsible adult (yes, they exist!).  I mean it's not like this has long term potential, anyway, so cutting off after 4 months isn't the worst thing to have to do (after all, can't exactly move in with a guy that doesn't work or understand how to pay rent without his mom helping)."
You wouldn't feel like his mother if this were an equal relationship. Dump him and find someone with basic hygiene.
"I'd leave before. It will be lingering on your mind and if you even have to question that, then i feel its best to go with the formal. Either way, in a non selfish form of thinking, you're going on a bday trip! Do you really wanna spend half of it worrying and nagging at a dude that seems to live like a pre teen?"
"Shit. You're probably right, it's just difficult to do a U-turn when he's really into me."
"Yeah it's really weird tbh, I can't wrap my head around it!!

As far as I know, they do wash their hands at least"
"Before or after my birthday? I know there's never a good time obviously but timescale wise, idk when would be easier for him to take it "
"(Your username is too good)

I'm finding it difficult meeting people since I'm not in education anymore, so I guess I don't want to be in a loose end and he's someone to be with in my free time. 
You're totally right though and I need to figure out how to break it off."
"He's a puppy; he'll be sad for a little while, but he'll find someone else to get enthusiastic about. "
Before. Definitely before. Don't wanna fake feeling any longer than you have to. Plus it'll be harder to do it after than before.
"Thank you!

As someone that's been out of school for well over a decade, I can tell you at first I thought making friends outside of school or work would be near impossible.  But that's also the fun part, you never really know when or where you're going to hit it off with potential friends or dates (ex. Uber/Lyft drivers, hotel concierge, bartenders and fellow patrons, a cute neighbor, at Costco when you both are excited over the same free sample).  If you really want to expand your social circle try taking some classes (fitness, dance, cooking, shooting, you name it) or join one of those livingsocial or meetup groups.  Getting a pet always makes a great ice breaker (going to the dog park so long as they don't fight with each other).  You'll be fine.

As for how to break things off, just be honest.  Start with the positive to ease into the...not so positive, ex. You enjoy his company and how he makes you feel but you don't want to be a mom and a girlfriend; you want an equal partner functioning on your same level of reality/priorities/hygiene.  He seriously needs to grow up if he ever wants to be in a successful relationship (or at the very least not die of food poisoning or periodontitis)."
"I'm not really fake feeling - I do still genuinely like him a lot, but all the little things are adding up and I just shouldn't have to tell him to wash his hands!!
It probably will be harder after, I just need to find the guts to do it "
"Yeah, I mean....you're having to tell the guy to wash his hands and brush his teeth now. You don't wanna be a nag to him forever, cause you'll have to be the way it's going. I think you're better off. Hope it turns out well! "
"It's okay to break up with anyone, the minute you decide to break up with them.  

It sucks he's got depression, but he doesn't seem to be doing anything to pull himself out of it and he's not even attempting any more. 

You don't have to go down with his ship."
"I went through with something similar with my boyfriend of 5 years. I thought he was the love of my life but I the end I couldn‚Äôt take it. Even if he is sick you don‚Äôt owe him your happiness. If you want to end it you should, even though it sucks."
"I would suggest that, before you end the relationship outright, you make the issue about tolerating his lack of pursuing treatment for his depression.  His depression is not the culprit, because - as you say - when he is compliant with treatment, the symptoms don't affect your relationship."
"You can break up for any reason. Relationships are supposed to make you better than if you were single. If that's not the case, then you shouldn't be in that relationship."
"He doesn't try to or even talk about coming to see you, he doesn't instigate conversation or respond to your emails unless heavily prompted, you haven't had sex in three years and even your kisses are just pecks. Your relationship has dwindled to practically nothing, anyone can see why you'd be ready to leave. You've very generously tried to help him by saying he could live with you rent free. He's just not doing anything to change his situation for himself or for your sake/the sake of your relationship. If you are ready to go it is understandable and fair. "
"To be honest, yes you‚Äôre coming off as arrogant when it comes to your friend. The whole my way or the highway mentality doesn‚Äôt get you far. You sound like a very passionate person, almost to a fault. I think you need better communication skills. Not everyone is going to agree with you and you have to learn to accept that and pick your battles. People usually don‚Äôt take well to unwarranted advice. "
"What are you getting out of these arguments versus what you want to get out of them? It sounds like you want to help people and feel satisfied because of your knowledge and superior values. People can tell when someone is doing that, and they don‚Äôt like it. Which ends up with both of you frustrated.

It doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôre right, arguing does not change people‚Äôs minds. Calmly and tentatively making suggestions will get you a lot farther - as long as you say it once and then happily drop it. ‚ÄúOh, I thought she was in that show a few years ago, I think it was on YouTube.‚Äù And let them look it up if they want to. ‚ÄúIt makes me a bit uncomfortable to think about people having Instagram sites to get followers of a different race, but I‚Äôm not sure why.‚Äù Let him decide whether he wants to discuss it or ignore you. 

If you take a more gentle approach, people still won‚Äôt admit they‚Äôre wrong in the moment, but they might consider what you‚Äôve said later on. 

By the way, I wouldn‚Äôt knock Nigerian values. I‚Äôve spent a lot of time there, and did find some people‚Äôs behaviour and views hard to take at first. But once I understood the sheer amount of... stuff that people have to deal with, I changed my attitude to mad respect that so many Nigerians manage such confidence, energy and civility."
So... some stuff you said here was really problematic. Like... the Nigerian stuff. Not okay. 
"It's good that you two can easily talk to each other and get along well. In a normal situation, I'd say it sounds like a natural opportunity to have your first girlfriend and get some dating experience in a relationship where you both like and respect each other. However, given this:

>If we were in an open community I would have definitely tried dating here and see what comes of it. However, (sadly) it is either we stay friends or we become potential ""fiances"". I know it is weird but it is how it works here.

I would probably not try dating her if you are worried about her being too dissimilar from you. But more even than that, I would reconsider whether or not you want to be wherever ""here"" is. I learned soooooo much from my dating relationships. I learned things about myself, about what I need in my partner, about how to be a good boyfriend/partner, about women, about equality, about how to treat somebody with respect...I think that jumping from no dating experience to ""potential fiance"" territory is difficult and takes away so much of that learning opportunity. It makes your dating decisions too high stakes and pushes you toward marriage even in relationships that aren't necessarily healthy or a good fit. On top of that, it will also make it more difficult to seek divorce, even though they pushed you to marriage with a bad fit."
Thank you for your comment. It is really insightful to hear from others' experiences. Leaving my home town is not something easy to do.
Yo have nothing to add but I just want to say I feel you! My almost gf (?) after small fights always sends me sweet messages and voice messages ( when she is drunk ) and it‚Äôs a big ego boost. I would guess because we are still very young these feelings are normal and will change with the years 
"Your heart will heal. Give it time. Eventually, you will have the chance to find someone who will love you but not abuse you.

Do you have any other friends with which to talk to about this? Friends can help share heart ache."
"Umm... Honestly thats a cue for (at leaat hypotheticaly potential progressive disorder of some sort). Sounds like you've experienced neglecting behavior earlier in life and when presented in an intimate situation it shapes itself as a sort of mania for drama and aproval. It's like, most of the people need supporting words or a look or a smile to feel special and loved, but you need to see their excruciating pain to be able to believe in it. The deeper the pain the more aproving it is. It makes up for the scale of your need. [Not trying to offend you or anything but thats kind of what i can make of your story]. I'd say you need a lifestyle change, a new enviroment to see other perspectives of getting the specialty you need. Although i doubt it will be able to substitute this dark urge for pain. As an alternative, try a therapist, but give it a practical try with your enviroment and friends first."
"Three years is a while at age 18, you probably ‚Äúmiss‚Äù it because it was familiar to you. 15-18 is a very weird age, I remember how much fun I had with my friends/boyfriend at the time, but I did a lot of dumb stuff. Remind yourself how what happened to you is not normal or okay, and that it WAS unhealthy, and that you weren‚Äôt good for each other. You also might want to talk to a therapist, like I said, three years at 18 is a while, speaking to someone professionally about it and learning some coping skills may help. Good luck!"
"haha. This is adorable. Just maybe message her again saying 'sorry my phone has been acting up, I don't know if you've got my message or not!'"
"I would wait a couple days, and then ask if she got the text."
"Does she have WhatsApp? Why don't you call her? 
Best of luck buddy"
Dude... Relax. She will respond. If she doesn't you know where you stand with her.
"You're putting in all the effort. He's selfish. Dump this guy and move on. I'd also have an abortion because this isn't the kind of man I'd want to be tied to for the rest of my life. I understand if you don't want that though. 

Seriously, this isn't a funk, it's a terrible relationship. "
"Sounds like you know the answer already, but this relationship is definitely not compatible. He doesn‚Äôt make you happy, make you a priority, he‚Äôs not considerate of your feelings, there‚Äôs barely any real chemistry, it‚Äôs time to let his ass go! In fact he is probably a good example of a bad boyfriend. Don‚Äôt waste anymore time on him, you‚Äôre still young!  There are too many red flags to ignore, and no girl should stay in a relationship where she isn‚Äôt appreciated. Good luck! "
This relationship sounds like it sucks and that it took awhile to figure it out because of the distance.
"If he needs to look at porn to get hard before having (really bad) sex, it simply means he is not sexually attracted to you. A guy's lower body wont lie that way. Plus, reading about what you do and what he does, i have the feeling there is a lot you shoulder, and that he basically treats you as simply an object to use. Dump him, find someone who really looks at you and who talks to you."
"I think I've figured out why this hot, ""super nice"" and smart guy hasn't had any serious relationships! He's a JERK. 

Whether or not the sex is normal, it sounds absolutely terrible and you don't like it. He sounds like someone who has a very warped idea of what a girlfriend is and almost...resents dating in a way--like, well, I'd better ""get"" something out of my forced monogamy...sigh. 

Ugh, please leave this guy in the dust. "
There was a lot to unpack in that title. 
"This is not normal stuff that happens, this is one person being selfish and addicted to porn while the other one tries her hardest to make things work. You can't make it work alone though. Im sorry. "
"Yea, I see that now "
Haha my marketing skills 0/5 
"Try. ""Hey. -insert name-, right? You went to -insert school name here- a few years ago.

And then begin having a conversation.

You know what to say. You're just nervous and that's okay. Just know that at worst, she ignores you or is mean. But that's not the end of the world. "
"Spank her on the bum and say  ‚Äúsup girl I saw you across the gym eyeing me up, thought you‚Äôd like to see the gun show.‚Äù Then proceed to flex and show her your calves. Girls love calves. Then you pick her up and take her to great place to eat and tell her all about your elite investment banking career. Girls love money. And yeah you‚Äôll get married and have children and yeah that‚Äôs all I have to say about that. "
"Knowing when to talk to her is also important. Try talking to her before or after her full workout. You don't want to annoy her before she gets to know you üòè
"
"Thing is we know what school we went to because it was literally 2 years ago and we're not at an age where (in my opinion) we would forget about who went there etc

I think i'd be fine after the 'introduction', just don't know how to start it, maybe she doesn't remember be or something?

Considering we didn't talk I think it'd be weird just saying something like ""Hey -insert name-"" as I wouldn't know what to say at this stage.

Also if you know what I should do next, like kind of get to know her that would be great "
"Sounds good, but I just recently joined the gym so calves aren't on point yet ahahah.

But seriously I doubt I'd do that tbf"
I concur. The gym is one of those places peoole can be really finicky about being bothered. It should be fine as long as you aren't annoying.
"Yeah I know hahah, hopefully she did 'check' me out or something and I'm not just making this shit up in my head. "
"Yeah. Obviously. It's just small talk to get into a real conversation.

  


It's not going to be some indie romantic comedy. You're not going to go up and say some witty joke that catches her off guard. She giggles and smiles at you reassuringly. Asks your name and reminisces about that time Mr. Harrison made fun of your solar system model. And then you create some inside joke about Pluto no longer being a planet that will return throughout the movie that is your lives.

Stop worrying about having the perfect conversation and just talk to her."
"""Six months"" means different things in different relationships. At that point, some people are still at ""yeah, this might be something serious,"" and others are all the way at, ""Let's get married!"" So there's no set expectation for what you should or shouldn't do at this point. All that matters is what you and your boyfriend work out together. 

Don't take on the responsibility of a huge party alone, particularly when you don't know most of these people. It sounds like your boyfriend may not even *want* a big birthday bash, because he's pretty low key about it. Ask him how he'd like to spend his birthday. If he does want a major party, offer to help HIM out with a few details. That way you're showing interest and commitment, but not taking on more expense than you can handle. 

Since he's so casual about it, my bet is he'd just as soon do something laid-back. Not everybody gets crazy about ""milestone"" birthdays. "
"I think you are totally right BUT I would make sure he completely understands that you aren't going to do throw a bash. Not in the ""oh you are just saying that"" kind of way, make sure he gets it."
"Nope, not your responsibility.

If he wants a big blowout birthday bash, he can and will organize it. You're expected to get some sort of gift, maybe some romantic sort of birthday observance. 

>I ask him and he says there‚Äôs time and not to worry he will figure something out 

Take your partner at his word."
"I don‚Äôt think you are wrong in feeling it‚Äôs not your responsibility to plan him a party.  Especially if when you‚Äôve asked him he‚Äôs been dismissive of the idea of planning anything.  

If you know who his best friend is, I would likely send them a message saying that you want to find out if they‚Äôre planning anything for him, otherwise I would stick with a nice dinner maybe a nice gift and leave it at that. The way you describe your boyfriend doesn‚Äôt seem as though he even wants a party.
"
"It depends if you're extraverted or not.  You should't be required to plan a party,  but you might want to coordinate what he wants with him.   Don't surprise him,  just help push him to make a plan.   

A friend gathering separate from a family get together could be nice,  but it can't be all on you if you don't know his friends.  Just push him to make a plan,  and go along with what he plans.   Also,  do your own thing.   Dinner date and a gift. 

6 months isn't long enough that you should be expected to surprise him with a party with all of his friends, but you could help him decide what he wants and give him a little push to choose something. "
Is that a thing? I planned my own low key 30th birthday thing and would have done  the same if I was in a relationship. 
He‚Äôs the type who does a lot for others and expects nothing... but I think if nothinggg were to happen he would be disappointed ... I‚Äôm leaning towards sending a message to his friends to join us for dinner - I‚Äôd pay his meal and they pay their own.  Just so there‚Äôs some inclusion.  I do understand their friends are checking w me so they don‚Äôt overtake plans if I had any.  
Exactly!  All I did was dinner and a night out w about ten close friends !! 
If his friends are asking about it why not offer to plan together with some of them? So you are not doing it all yourself?
"He isn't asking you to so anything. He says that he will figure it out. Respect that. Not everyone makes a big deal out of birthdays, even round numbers that end in 0. 


It's not your job to throw him a party. He's a grown up. If he wants to do something for his birthday, he will. Do not plan anything without his consent and input."
I‚Äôd love to but I don‚Äôt want to get in a spot where I feel like I can say no.... or have ten different ideas at this point - I can def talk to his bf tho
"Honestly other than recommend outside help there isn't much you can do unless someone in the situation wants to change. 

As an addendum I would make sure the backup plan isn't that your brother comes and lives with you when your parents are no longer able to. They might not be pushing him as hard as they should if they think there is someone else who will take up the mantle when they are gone."
"As far as beating some sense into your folks, I wonder if sitting them down for a talk about their wills, power of attorney, do not ressate,, organ donation, cremation or burial...you know all that end of life stuff that you are going to be executor of...will bring them out of their fog.
This is the perfect moment to face them with the fact that your brother will need to be going into a specialized living situation, and they have not prepared for that to happen.
It takes years for someone like your brother to secure a space, and most likely all his assests will be gobbled up upon admittance, if a special trust hasn't been put into place well before hand. 
Financial advice should be at the top of your list."
"Im gonna tell you now as a woman who has had a few bad exs and has been married for three years now you are not being over dramatic. I know this is gonna be hard to accept but he is using you. He has feelings for them still, if he was over them he would not talk to them, and even if he did not have feelings for them if you make it clear to him that it makes you very uncomfortable with him still talking to exs even as friends and he still continues to talk to them then he doesn't respect you. My husband still was friends with a few of his exs but when i talk to him about and told him it made me uncomfortable he reassured me he had no feelings for them and stopped talking to them out of respect for me. If he respects you and how you feel then if you ask him to delete the pictures and stop talking to them he will. If not then you dont want him in your life because he is going to cheat on you. Trust me it has happened to me numerous times before i met my husband a man who truly cared and respected for me and how i feel. Thats the difference between a man and a boy."
"Girl, you know you aren't being overdramatic and this is some nonsense. Keeping nudes of not one but TWO exes who he is still communicating with? No. It's only a matter of time before he sleeps with someone else, it doesn't sound like he is at all ready for a serious relationship of any kind. How you handle this situation is you recognize you are 19 with a whole lot of life ahead of you and you drop this 26 year old loser who keeps naked photos of women he used to date. "
"Not to be harsh but you didn't cure your depression in three weeks. Also, be with someone who you don't have to plead with."
"Depression doesn‚Äôt get ‚Äúcured.‚Äù  It‚Äôs great that the meds are helping you, but that not how it works.  You don‚Äôt just take some pills and Voila! No more depression! "
"> I am also very aware of my stark loneliness, and hopelessness to find anyone I could love remotely as much as my boyfriend 

Feeling lonely and hopeless are not a good reason to want him back. You need time alone to work on yourself. 

> I realized that my goals were wrong and my real goals aligning with his perfectly

That's not how it works. Yes, goals/thoughts/feelings *can* change, but not like that. In one week, you don't ""realize"" your goals were wrong and oh, guess what your ""real goals"" align perfectly with his. That's a result of the desperation you're feeling. You *want* your goals to align with his, but if you're being honest with yourself, they haven't changed in an instant like you want to believe. 

> I know I should move on. But I just can‚Äôt see myself with anyone else (truly, I have very particular tastes and I‚Äôd rather be alone than lower my standards.)

Yes, you should move on. In a way, you are lowering your standards to try to continue to be with him. You've given up whatever part of your goals you've changed. You've reduced yourself to begging and pleading for someone who has told you he no longer loves you. 

There is no way you cured your depression in the week that you're claiming you did so. This mission you're on to get him back may be giving you a sense of purpose and some of the depression symptoms may have subsided as a result, or you're ignoring the symptoms because you believe that's the answer to getting this guy back. Either way, the depression isn't gone, and I worry what happens when your last desperate attempt fails. You really need to let it go, for your own sake and health, and work on yourself. Continue on whatever medication you're on, see a therapist, and focus on you for a while. "
"His opinion can change, but it wont change without time. Have you gained or lost a significant amount of weight during your relationship? Have you withdrawn from the outside and pulled into him?  Do you have a vibrant social life? These things all affect attraction.

In my personal experience depression isn't cured in the amount of time you described. It's often a long climb until you realize it's a problem, then a long climb down. Like falling into a pit and climbing out. You have the shock of losing your relationship which is why you've awoken out of your stupor, but that isn't a cure, if things proceed I can nearly guarantee you will fall back into your old habits.

I would suggest if you **truly** want this guy back that you go No Contact and work on sustained and maintained mood and emotional control. To a certain extent it's a skill and one that people with depression should learn to understand and hone.

If you continue down the path you are currently pushing however, I can almost guarantee that you will lose your boyfriend forever. You are giving him too much power and power absolute corrupts. He can't fully respect you as you are now. That is an indispensable part of human nature.

You need to execute a tactical retreat and work on yourself for months. If he ends up with someone else it will hurt, but it will also make you stronger. Once you know you are supremely comfortable in your mental health you can reach back out to him if you still feel like it."
He doesn‚Äôt want you. He would rather be with someone else than you. You are not the best person to be with him or he would want to be with you - and he doesn‚Äôt want you. 
Why do you want to get back together with someone who doesn't want to be with you? Love isn't enough on its own.
"I'm sorry, it's over."
"I didn't cure my depression, a medication did. My medication is also being supplemented with a treatment plan. I am a billion times better than I was 3 weeks ago, though I must acknowledge that if I were to stop the medication I would probibly quickly slip back down hill."
It is in forever-remission then lol. I'm taking meds and doing scientifically proven cognitive treatments. I don't see myself ever being depressed again.
"My goals really do align with his (but said goals actually include moving away from him), but while we were together my goals were to be as close as him as possible. Him breaking up with me is actually wonderful, in a way, because it made me realize my true goals. I believe you are mistaken about my depression too, but that is neither here nor there.

I do think you are right though about me lowering my standards to be with him. I shouldn't want to be with anyone who doesn't want to be with me. That should be my number 1 pre-requiset for a relationship. But I don't know how to stop *wanting* to be with him. I don't know how to get closure other than to be rejected by him again. Right now in my head it is a zero sum game: either I am with him or I am alone the rest of my life. Being alone isn't the end of the world, but it sure ain't ideal."
"Thank you for your answer.

I had a vibrant social life before I started dating him, and I have a vibrant social life once again, but I fell into an unhealthy co-dependent pattern with him. I absolutely do not want our old relationship back, I want a new, healthy relationship with him.

I want to acknowledge that my depression is not something I understood or started working on overnight. I have been working on it for years, and I like to think slowly improving, but I ironically found a treatment that WORKS right after my boyfriend broke up with me. My boyfriend was aware of my mental health issues and I was quite open with him about my search for treatment. I was never complacent with depression. The meds are helping me but I am also supplementing that by continuing my behavioral treatments.

You are likely right about me giving him too much power. However, I feel rushed to resolve this because before we broke up he spoke about moving away somewhere else. I am also not good at playing games. I like to know where I stand with people, tear bandaids off and whatnot."
"I can see you are probibly right on an intellectual level, but on an emotional level I am struggling to understand this. Do you have any advice on how to get emotional closure?"
"We have corresponding goals and great sexual chemistry, and when we are getting along, we have great companionship, making each other laugh. The corresponding goals is a big reason.

I don't like most people, am not attracted to most people, and don't have goals that match up with most people. For me to consistently enjoy someone's company and be very attracted to them AND to have matching goals with them--it is so rare I think I will be able to find it again. Maybe I'm wrong, but I feel like it is either him or being alone.

And what is love anyway? I'm thinking maybe love isn't so important maybe. It is the goals, companionship, and attraction that are important.

EDIT: Honestly, I don't know if I can ever be physically attracted to anyone else ever again. That might be the main issue. He awakened a kind of fetish in me that only he can fulfill."
"The fact that you state lower down in the post that after three weeks your depression is in ""forever remission"" is one of the most naive things I have ever read in the sub. I am happy that you are feeling better, but you are in no way emotionally ready to confront the man who just told you that he doesn't love you anymore. He doesn't want your gift he doesn't want to talk about it he wants to get his stuff and leave.

Improving yourself takes time and hard work. While it's great you are seeing results, he will be just as trepidatious as we are being if you present yourself to him as ""see all better!"" because every one here knows that it isn't all better. It will come off as disingenuous. If you really want there to be a chance of reconciliation back off, no contact for a period of months while you continue to work on yourself. If you try and push it now it will end in disaster."
In which case you have zero knowledge of how depression actually works or you never had it in the first place.
"If you were depressed for a long time, a new medication allows you to start working on your issues; it doesn't ""cure"" anything. And if you have to plead with a person to get back together with you? Even if they say yes it's going to be a short, miserable relationship because they don't actually want to be with you. 

If goals and companionship matter most to you, it sounds like you two would be better off as friends (after a year or two apart to get over each other fully). You will have sexual chemistry with other people too, I promise."
"I agree that waiting months to contact him would be best, but I expect him to move in a few months, if not weeks--and I may be moving in a few months myself. I also expect it to be impossible to reconcile if we are not in the same physical vicinity.

If there is no chance of reconciliation I really want to be sure of that. and I don't want to linger painfully for months if there is only a slight chance. Do you think my plan of giving him the painting and being rejected one last time could at least give me the closure of thinking we are truly done? I guess closure is almost more important to me than getting back together with him."
PM me if you are trying to find a better way to treat your own depression.
"It is all 3 that matter lol. I have close, conventionally attractive male friends who I have goals in common with and companionship. I could find an man who is on-paper attractive enough, easily enough, but sexual attraction for me is so rare I am on the cusp of being asexual.

I know that there are people who are happy being alone all their lives but I can't help but seeing a romantic relationship as the cherry on top of a good life. I guess if getting back together with him isn't an option, I need to learn how to stop longing for a totally fulfilling romance."
"I think the break up is too fresh to expect closure or reconnecting, either of those expectations is too high IMO. I think you are setting yourself up for failure.

Also, there is always an excuse to not go NC. It doesn't matter if he is moving. "
I'm sorry to say but you can be sure there's no chance of reconciliation. 
"Honey, I‚Äôve suffered with depression longer than you‚Äôve been on the planet.  You are either living in fantasy land or were never depressed to begin with. You haven‚Äôt discovered a magical cure. /u/-blent- is correct. Your bf is doing the right thing in trusting his gut. You can‚Äôt make someone love you. "
"There was one person out there that hit all 3 for you, which means there are more people out there you could have a fulfilling romantic relationship with. You will be much better served going out and looking for those other people, because this one doesn't want to be with you anymore. "
"Is closure that hard to come by? With all my other relationships, closure was never an issue, but we always broke off amicably."
Why? Any advice on how to get closure?
"I didn't discover a magic cure for depression. Psychotherapists and neurologists did. PM me if you want to know what it is. It is a treatment that you probibly have never heard of as it has only been gaining recognition in the last year or so, so even if you have been depressed longer than I have been alive, that is not relevant. Seriously, PM me if you want to know about a treatment that could potentially change your life, but I am not wasting my time bothering to advertise this treatment to people who are too close-minded to even believe there is such an effective treatment."
"Yeah, it only took me 15 years of actively looking to find this guy though."
"He's told you very plainly, multiple times, that it is over. Please respect his need for space and time.   

You get closure by continuing your therapy. Closure comes from within, not another person. "
Does it come from an MLM? 
You sound like you‚Äôve been hanging out with snake oil salesmen.  (I understand you won‚Äôt get the meaning here.  It‚Äôs okay.  Clearly you‚Äôve consumed the Kool-Aid.  You won‚Äôt get that one either...Nevermind.)
"Nope! I ain't selling anything. PM me if you're actually curious.

I know people don't like unsolicited advice on how to cure mental health issues so that's a main component of why I'm not saying what it is."
"Dude, you're proving my point. Literally, y'all have nothing to lose by PMing to ask what the treatment it and I have nothing to gain by telling you what the treatment is. This is freaking an anomalous internet forum, don't confuse it with real life. And I **understand** I don't have much credibility on here because I just wrote a long diatribe about how I want to get back with my boyfriend so I am not openly talking about an effective treatment for depression because when people first hear about this treatment, I should hope they hear about it from a more reliable source unless they actively ask me.

But seriously, when I was depressed, I researched the fuck out of mental health because I didn't want to be depressed. I wanted to get better. I tried many things. I don't believe you can help people who don't want to get better though, so I'm not going to tell anyone who is going to automatically dismiss me as a snake oil salesman. You also have no idea how funny it is that you are trying to say I don't understand what a snake oil salesman is or drinking the kool aid."
You didn't tell him about the cheating because you wanted him to ask you so you could keep in contact. Stop it. You finished the relationship and he's moved on. Get your name off the lease of your new place and move on.
"He moved on with his affair partner. He doesn't need clarification from you because he was already cozied up in a relationship with her.

Stop obsessing over this asshole. He is not worth your time. "
"He has moved on, do the same. It will be a painful journey but you will be okay at the end of it. "
"By far the most common advice when dealing with a break up is to go no-contact with your ex. It helps you process things and move on faster. It definitely just looks like your ex is doing exactly that. Your best bet is to continue doing the same, and try to stop thinking about him. "
He cheated on you. How much more does he have to do to prove that he doesn't give a single fuck about you? Sometimes we stay with people because it's easy while emotionally we're over the relationship. That's probably what happened here. 
"One of the most important things I learned after leaving a cheater - I was married for 25 years - was that it was NEVER my job to figure out what he was thinking. Never. It was only ever my job to figure out myself. 

Believing we are supposed to figure out the other person, figure out their feelings, sheild them from unpleasantness . . . super codependent crap, and furthermore disordered cheater types count on us being very wrapped up in them, and their problems.

Just drop that rope, and walk away. Go have a life where you are the central figure. Find out what you like best.

Who gives a shit what a cheater knows or thinks? I can tell you right now: he thinks he is entitled to whatever he wants in the moment. He is a toddler, basically.

It's tempting to want to make sure they know you left because they got caught, but it truly will not matter to the cheater. They will be upset they got caught, but not that it caused you pain, not that they lost you. That part does not hurt a person like this, so don't even bother. Just go start the rest of your life."
"I think that deep down you want him to contact you and confess to what he did, then tell you it was all a mistake and beg your forgiveness so you two can live happily ever after.

Hon, it's not going to happen.  He just moved on with his side piece.  He's not worried about closure because he doesn't give a shit.  You're the one who's going to have to figure it out and provide your own emotional resolution.  Whatever you do, stay strong and don't contact him.  Just realize that it's over, he's a creep and move on.  I'm sorry."
"> He doesn‚Äôt know I know and hasn‚Äôt asked me for any explanations about the breakup. 

I think he DOES know why you broke up and he doesn't want to talk to you about it because he knows he did something shitty so you had to do the right thing for yourself. Either that or this was his way of getting out of the relationship so he could go on with his side chick. He's not contacting you because he has no reason to. He got what he wanted, which was an end to his involvement with you.

Continue doing the right thing for yourself and put this dipstick out of your mind for good.
"
"Why do you care?

Why are you wasting mental bandwidth on this enema nozzle?"
"You‚Äôre still expecting him to act like the decent man you thought he was. He is not that man. 

He‚Äôs a cheater which means he‚Äôs an arrogant and entitled *coward*. Cowards will take any easy way out. Including not asking why you left. He knows. He doesn‚Äôt want to deal. Because he‚Äôs a coward and not a quality person. Laugh at him. Seriously, by yourself, think of how stupid he‚Äôs been. Did he think you wouldn‚Äôt find out?! Does he think he‚Äôs such a catch he‚Äôs entitled to that behavior?! Ridiculous! Sad! Now laugh out loud. What an idiot. 

You win OP. It doesn‚Äôt feel that way, but you have. "
"You thought breaking up with him would teach him a lesson and he'd beg you to come back. Now you are dissapointed and confused that he didn't even bother asking why and probably moved on. Forget it, don't add any more pain to your suffering. Move on! "
"I know this hurts like hell but stop wondering and thinking about this.  Stop hoping he will contact you.  Fight your instincts and move on.  The faster you accept 100% your relationship is over, the faster you will heal.  There are guys out there that will treat you well and will be delighted to be with you.  Meet them when you are ready. "
He hasn't reached out because he doesn't care. You should move on and stop investing more energy into him.
Have you gotten your name off the appartment lease? 
"I think maybe you wanted him to chase after you, you wanted him to beg you to stay, and maybe you even wanted the big blow-up, knock-down, drag-out fight as some sort of 'closure'.


But you don't **need** any of that stuff, I promise you.  Closure is a myth.  The validation is not that important.  It will still feel strange to think this way, but **he** is not important anymore.  Only your sense of self-respect is.  And on that level, so far you've done brilliantly.  You didn't stand for any shit, you didn't waver, you just did what you had to do to protect you.  Every time you start to obsess about unimportant stuff, think about that instead.  "
He left those messages for you to discover ! 
"You have him a REALLY easy way out, girl, what were you expecting? This was probably the perfect situation for him. He didn't even have to feel guilty because you never addressed the actual issue. This is why you communicate. "
"It would be so satisfying if he called you and called you, begging to know what happened, begging for another chance, swearing up and down that he would do anything for you, asking how this could have happened. It would feel so good.

And then you could coldly let him know that you found out about the cheating, and let him know how he was the bad guy all along, and you are the wounded victim, and you could make him squirm, and now he would be the horrible monster who tormented you, instead of you being the cold, heartless one who walked away, while he thinks he did nothing wrong, and you just left him out of the blue, like a monster.

The time to tell him you knew about the cheating was when you broke up with him, and you didn't, and that's okay. You didn't owe him an explanation. You're out of a bad situation, and that's all that matters.

It would be extremely satisfying to set the record straight, but that's just not going to happen. In your own best interest, it's time to let this go, and move forward. You're never going to get the closure that you want, you're never going to have the chance to set the record straight, you're never going to be able to throw this back in his face. That's okay. I'm sure he knows. It didn't even need to be said. He's with his affair partner now, he's not even thinking of you. A year from now, you're going to be so happy you're gone, this won't even cross your mind. It hurts a lot now, because it's all still so fresh. It's going to be a grieving process, and it won't be easy. I'm really sorry you're going through it.

I think that it might help to talk to a counselor or therapist if you can, just to help you process all these feelings. Anytime anyone goes through a grieving process like this, I think it helps to talk to someone about it. In the meantime, be gentle with yourself, and when you can, try to feel gratitude for being out of that bad situation, and away from someone who cared very little about you. You did the right thing."
">We have had a pretty rocky past together but have worked through everything.

Did you actually have a good relationship with him? Because from what you wrote here, it doesn't seem like it was a good one. And did you actually work through everything together? Or did you just get over it? 

>We signed our lease together while the cheating was happening, so I know he still wanted our relationship to continue.

Nope. One hard lesson for women to learn is that many men stay with women they don't love or respect for comfort. There are men out there that marry women they're already cheating on and will keep cheating on. There are men that live or marry women just to have someone cook, clean and raise kids for them. Their wives/companions don't even realize it. And you are one of them. For whatever reason, you thought your relationship was important but he didn't. It's a harsh lesson to learn, but from now on, learn to read men's behaviour better. It will save you from a lot of disappointment and heartbreak."
"Honestly, this just shows the coward he is. He has an out without being the bad guy and he‚Äôs taking it. I read an article how Men process breakups differently than women. Women feel everything at once and ‚Äúget it all out‚Äù and are able to move on after about a year completely. For men, it takes a while to sink in before it hits and they take a lot longer or sometimes never get over someone they love. He is distracted with his mistress rn but once the novelty of it wears off he will stop romanticizing it once reality sets in. You‚Äôll be hearing from him in 3-6 months. That‚Äôs when you hit him with ‚ÄúI dumped you because you were cheating‚Äù and hopefully by then it won‚Äôt hurt the way it does now. Trust me, this chick is going to start getting on his nerves and you‚Äôre the one he‚Äôs going to be thinking about."
"You already got a lot of advice on how to deal with this so I just wanted to sympathize with you a little bit. I'm sorry he hasn't reached out to you. That really sucks and I can imagine I would be just as frustrated and sad as you were. You just ended a long term relationship right before moving into a new place together, why the hell hasn't he contacted you by now?? Something like that warrants a larger response from him and it feels so unfair that you didn't get to have that closure :( For what it's worth, I don't think that the relationship was so meaningless to him that he didn't care enough to reach out to you. I think he's just a coward who is fully aware that you probably found out about the cheating and he can't face the reality of what a shit person he is. Facing you is too hard for him and so he's just cutting loose and letting you go. That says more about him as a person than it does about his feelings towards the relationship."
"Because he didn't care OP. I'm sorry :( If he cared and respected you, he would have at least wanted to find out what went awry. You fight for the people you care about. Not only did he not fight for you, he couldn't be bothered to even inquire about what happened. I'm sorry you spent three years in this relationship, and I recommend seeking therapy so you can fully process what happened and recover.

Good luck. "
"It‚Äôs shitty that he cheated, but I can‚Äôt ignore the fact that the way you ended things was really emotionally immature. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe he didn‚Äôt ask me why I left him when I just packed and left him and gave him no reason why!‚Äù That‚Äôs childish. You should have told him that you know about the coworker and it‚Äôs over. Now you‚Äôre not getting closure because of the dumb game you played. And you might have to just let this one go without the closure. But honestly fuck him. Move on. And learn from this. Learn to communicate like an adult.  "
"i just wanna say im super proud of how you ended the relationship! that is so empowering in itself. a lot of people (myself included) have stayed with a partner who cheated on them because it can seem harder to leave then stay. that to me shows how strong you are. i know you wish he was chasing you down and begging for mercy, but the more you focus on yourself and less on him, the less you will give a shit about how he's affected in this. keep being the amazingly strong person you are, i know it will work out for you :)"
"Because 1) he has figured it out and 2) he is testing out the new girl.

Sorry-glad you found out before moving in together."
"I don't understand why you're a nervous wreck?  He's in your past now, it's time to move on. "
"Why do you care what he thinks happened? You‚Äôre done, move on."
"Take the W. He cheated. You left effectively. He respected that.  Keep on walking.

From a legal perspective (Im an attorney), you're going to need to figure out the lease thing."
"I broke up with a long distance boyfriend who was hemming and hawing about me moving to his town. Not IN with him, just to the same town. I said if you are not sure, then see ya.  I blew off the wedding I was supposed to attend with him. 

I also waited, thinking we would clear the air. But what I was really expecting was a grand gesture. The fact that there was no attempt to fight for me was enough.  "
He hasn't contacted you because he figures you found out about the cheating. Making a clean cut and moving on would be the best thing for you to do for yourself. There is no need to draw this out. 
"Get your name off the lease, any way you can."
You told him you're done and you're wondering why he isn't stalking you? How high are you?
"You wanted to be calm cool and collected breaking up but you also wanted to school him. Can‚Äôt have your cake and eat it, too."
Why the fuck do you care is the question you should be asking yourself! Stop worrying about him and move on with your life!
I think he realises that you saw the evidence. That's why he doesn't want any further conversations about the break-up.
"He's with his affair partner. I know it's hard when you don't have closure, so to speak, but he's not even remotely worth your time or head space. Move on and find someone who won't be a massive waste of your time."
"You know what, I think you need to text him and just let him have it. Him not contacting you has really bothered you. I‚Äôm with everybody else, he doesn‚Äôt care or he would of contacted you. Maybe if his other girl goes ahead and ends things you will hear from him, or who knows, he might have side chick #3 on speed dial, but if you need to tell him he is a jerk to get over him than do it! "
Maybe because he's still in shock? This would come as a huge surprise even to someone who's cheating. Or maybe he knows you must have found out and is ashamed of himself? You'll never know unless you talk to him about it. Also I suspect the nerves you're feeling right now aren't related to his not reaching out to you but are related to his cheating on you. 
"In my experience the best thing to do is have no contact at all, it‚Äôll give you a chance to see things in retrospect, the main reason why my own past relationships were so hard to move on from was the constant communication, once the person is truly evicted from your life will the healing begin. He isn‚Äôt worth the energy of a conversation anyways, and he doesn‚Äôt owe you anything (although it would be ideal for him to be accountable for his actions) no one does, he‚Äôs a shite person that‚Äôs it. You‚Äôre so strong for leaving, that takes a lot of courage "
"It's called a break up because it's broken.  This isn't fixable and you're not going to get that movie moment that you're hoping for out of him.  Breathe, move on, live your best life.  You can get through this but only if you leave him behind."
"Not to be cruel, but he likely saw this as a blessing in disguise.

Just block him now in case things don‚Äôt work out with her and he tries to slide back in your life. "
He hasn't contacted you because he know EXACTLY why you left.  No further clarification needed on your end.  
"Take his lack of contact as a blessing, you'll never have to deal with him, or his cheating again. You had a clean break. You were already in the process of relocation so packing was a breeze, you discovered the cheating before you might have been financially ""trapped"" or obligated to keep contact with him, these are all blessings. Stop worrying about his experience, and get to experiencing your own. He's gross. "
"Yeah like some others have mentioned it sounds like he really just does not care about you at all. Seems like if anything he was relieved, probably had been looking to get out anyway and you saved him the trouble "
The reason he didn't say anything at the time was probably because he already knew why you were dumping his sleazy ass.
"He knows why you left, he doesn't need any answers from you. "
"There's a good chance that he assumed that you figured out he was cheating. There's also a possibility that he wanted a breakup and was too much of a pansy to ask for one. Either way, moving on is the best advice I can see."
He knows what he did and is ashamed.
He‚Äôs distracted with the coworker. Don‚Äôt expect him to contact you until they hit a bump in the road.
"Well, if that does not convince you that you did the right thing nothing will. Were you expecting him to fight for you just so you could confront him about the cheating? Not worth it. 

block and move on, you dodged a bullet."
He cheated on you! You should be so happy you're out of that relationship.
"He knows. 

He‚Äôs also a shit. Fuck that guy. Heal up and find someone deserving of you. "
He got to avoid the embarrassing conversation of being called out . He's certainly not going to open that door . He knows you know I'm sure. 
These responses are fabulous make sure u print them out and look whenever you have an urge to message him 
He hasn't asked for an explanation because he either doesn't care and is glad it's over (evidence: cheating) or can put two and two together and figure out you must have realized he was cheating (duh) or has put two together with some other unhappiness that he's suspected would cause you to leave him for a while. 
"A. You just want a reason to talk to him. No contact and move on

B. He may have figured out you knew and isn't saying anything 

C. He may not care because he's an ass

Move on "
Stay strong don‚Äôt worry about why he hasn‚Äôt contacted you. You were strong enough to leave and not let yourself be played. So you‚Äôre definitely strong enough to let him go and move on with your life. A man like that is not worth your time and damn sure not worth you stressing over. 
"Wow girl this is toxic. Are you done? If so why does it matter. That is your pride talking but he would still be a cheating asshole.

If you need closure, go back and tell him why he‚Äôs a cheating asshole.

Either way stop sitting there wondering ‚Äúdid he not love me enough to fight for me‚Äù because that‚Äôs the way he‚Äôs coming across. And also... I‚Äôd say he clearly did not if he could cheat on you. You‚Äôve done the hard part, burn the bridge and keep moving forward "
"What he thinks about this situation doesn‚Äôt matter. The *why* doesn‚Äôt matter. What does matter is you. You moved on from a cheater, and you chose not to let him in on why. That‚Äôs fine, as it seems you did not need that closure. It doesn‚Äôt matter what he thinks, or suspects, or wonders, because your relationship is over. Knowing what he thinks won‚Äôt make him not a cheater, or change the situation you are in in any significant way. Just let it go, move on, and focus on you. "
"You‚Äôre looking for closure, which is healthy.

He‚Äôs a cheater, which means he‚Äôs likely terrified of real intimacy. Which means he actively does Not want closure. It‚Äôs too intimate and scary. 

Also- the fact that you are still hung up on His reactions and why He does what he does.... and the fact that you chose and stayed with someone for 3 years who was likely not really emotionally available (guessing a bit, but seems likely), suggests that... you may be drawn to this kind of person again.

Might be worth exploring why, with a therapist, to avoid having this happen over and over.

I‚Äôm sorry you were betrayed and hurt :-("
"You caught him. You left. I'm sorry but he doesnt owe you the satisfaction of crawling back and asking. You didnt mean as much to him as he meant to you. He likely knows why you left and is content to simply leave you gone.

We (people) can be enormously cruel and callous shitstains."
"Do not message him or contact him. Its been a week since youve heard from him and i'm sure you want to have a word, but dont. He cheated and will continue to if you choose to take him back. He'll just get better at hiding the fact. If he hasnt admitted it to you and hasnt contacted you, than its over. IMO."
"He probably realizes you know he cheated so why would he contact you? For you to yell at him and tell him he's an asshole? Yeah no like a real cheater he won't face responsibility for his actions and thus won't face you. He takes the easier way, just like with the lying and cheating.

It might feel to you like him not reaching out to you is a sign he never cared as much as you thought he did and that hurts you even more, but I don't think so. He obviously cared enough to move it with you. He just realizes it's over now and doesn't care for the fallout bc he's ultimately selfish. My advice: move on. It's over. If you feel like saying more to him you can reach out and do so, but there's really nothing left for you there. He's shown you the kind of person he is."
"He knows you found out, he just doesn‚Äôt care. If he didn‚Äôt know he would contact you. Move on from that pos."
he thinks he dodged a bullet. He doesn't want to have to explain the cheating. He isn't contacting you because he wants it to continue to be your decision based on nothing he did wrong. I don't understand why you didn't say up front why you were leaving. That makes no sense. You can't attempt to rationalize someone's behaviour when it is a response to something false. 
"I know exactly how you feel and while going no contact is the best thing you can do, its the hardest right now. So can you think of anything you can contact him for ? The lease ? Something you left at his place? And then idk sneak in the convo that you know he cheated? Or you know what, if you're gonna go no contact, might as well text him and tell him off and that you know he cheated. And THEN go no contact."
"Just wanted to say, I know what you‚Äôre going through and I know how hard it is. I know that you‚Äôre telling yourself all the logical things: he was already checked out, he had a girl to comfort him anyway, he‚Äôs too much of a selfish fuckhead to care about you as long as he‚Äôs getting his. STILL tho you‚Äôre like ‚Äúbut all that time we spent together, doesn‚Äôt that mean ANYthing? If any of it was real wouldn‚Äôt he at least want to KNOW why I left? What was real at all, if he can accept this and walk away? ESPECIALLY when, if I hadn‚Äôt found the evidence, we‚Äôd be moving in together??‚Äù That shit is gonna keep you up at night, and accepting that you were that close to someone who really is as heartless and selfish as we‚Äôre telling you he is feels almost impossible. You want answers, you want him to at least act like leaving had any impact on him, you‚Äôre wondering about what if‚Äôs and feeling (at best) a little sick thinking that he‚Äôs not suffering at all when he damn well should be. 

As impossible as it sounds, and I know how impossible it sounds, you gotta just move on. He is an experience that is now over, that‚Äôs it. The you that you were with him has grown into the you that you are after him, no amount of explanation or begging or crying from him will change that. Take time to figure out who you want to be, and work on that. Maybe he‚Äôs suffering horribly having lost you, maybe he‚Äôs not, but the you that gives a fuck how he feels is past you. It‚Äôs not easy, but you got this."
 Closure as an event or something that someone else provides you is a myth. Only you provide yourself closure. You ripped the band aid. Leave it.
He doesn‚Äôt value you (he‚Äôs a cheater) so are you really surprised he doesn‚Äôt value you enough to care about your explanation for leaving him? I‚Äôm not. Why do you care what he thinks happened? He stopped caring the moment he got with his coworker months ago. I don‚Äôt mean to be harsh‚Äî you deserve better!! You WILL find better. 
"If you feel that talking to him would be helpful, then do so. However, be prepared to hear some hurtful things. Good luck!"
You already got your closure by finding out he cheated. No matter what he says to you in the future it won't matter so I'm not sure what you are looking for.   My suggestion is block don't ever communicate with him and live your life. 
Such a swift break up you didn‚Äôt really get proper closure or conclusion to loose ends.
"What most are saying seems right, just forget about him. He isnt going to reach out to you, and if he does hes just going to wrap you back around his finger n cheat again. If you really really have to, i dont see anything wrong with telling him you knew and telling him off then just not speaking. Or maybe dont so he slips up w the new girl and you get that petty revenge. Either way hes done and honestly isnt worth the time to think about. For right now, focus on yourself and the thought of finding someone new"
"That's why I'm a fan of letting people know..when you break up with them, tell them why.

Now when friends ask him what happened between the two of you, he gets to tell the story about his psycho ex-gf who moved out in a day while he was at work, and get all their sympathy.


"
"He was cheating. He knows why. 

What you need to ask yourself is why its important to you that you get an explanation. You already know he cheated. You know why people cheat. If things were rocky, theres your explanation. Stop worrying about this guy. Start worrying about what to do with YOU. "
"I think you are over-thinking and fantasizing this. Would you expect him to contact you after dropping a hard ball like that? Chances are, if he was banging a coworker he really didn't and doesn't give a shit. "
"That's because he doesn't care...now he gets to be with her, why would he try talking to you? You made it easy for him.."
"He might not care or want to ask because he is preoccupied with her. Maybe he was already considering leaving you, but didnt think he could. Either way. I think Youre overthinking this. It is over and doesnt,matter too much anymore"
Just say why you left that's it. People need to stop not being brutally honest and start doing so. 
Takes two people to be in a relationship. It appears to me that you were the only one. Sorry it ended badly. I hope you will find someone to love and respect you. Seems to me you deserve much better.
I'm so sorry. Things will work themselves out. Time heals.. just take care of yourself OP.
"When someone shows you who they are, believe them. 
Believe that he doesn‚Äôt respect you or care about your feelings, because if he did he wouldn‚Äôt have cheated. Believe that you can do better than someone who would lie to you and potentially risk your health by exposing you to STDs.
Most importantly, believe that you deserve better than all of that, because you do! 
Closure is overrated. It gives the cheater a way to excuse their behavior when there really is no good rhyme or reason. You don‚Äôt need that, and you certainly don‚Äôt need him."
"You're trying to control the actions of others, which just isn't going to happen. If you want to talk to him, then talk to him, that's being direct in what you want. Leaving and passively hoping he talks to you is insanity."
"He doesn't wany an explanation because he wanted to break up so he can be with his affair person. By you making the move and breaking it up he doesn't have to justify why he cheated.

In his mind you've done him a favour, he gets out of the relationship and with his new partner without being the bad guy. He didn't break up with you so he feels the blames not on him and he doesn't have to deal with the confrontation of being found out a cheat.

I would confront him, tell him you know he's cheated and how you know and make him squirm. Let him know what he has done makes him a shitty person then block him and move on."
Some people just cheat instead of breaking up. You technically did him a favour. That's why he never said anything. 
"He didn't contacted you, because now, he is the good one who been thrown away out of nowhere and you are the one who left as he was at work. "
I would just assume that he believes that you found out about the cheating. It's the most likely possibility. 
Why would you want him to contact you? It sounds like you up and left cause you wanted to be cut loose from this guy? 
He moved on either because he thought that you were cheating on him as well and he felt guilty [best case scenario]. Because he loved you enough to respect any decisions you made. Or bc he was planning on separating eventually and being with [25 F] afterward [worst case scenario].
"After 3 years together you left without saying anything. And you are mad because he does care at all ?

He just moved on and didn't care about you (since he cheated on you).

Even if he is a cheater you probably shouldn't have done that either if you wanted him to talk to you."
"If I was him and a girl gave me a vague reason like that I'd just cut her off too. You should've said why because now he just thinks you had no reason/got bored/you were cheating/you found someone else/who knows what. You should've just told him but he probably would've still just not contacted you. From his point of view as well, he's giving you what you wanted. Ask yourself how you'd be reacting if he was chasing you, I bet it'd just strengthen your convictions right? Either way if you broke up then why do you care if he contacts you or not?  

I'll get downvoted for this but this is what irritates me about girls after a breakup, there are too many games that can be played. I once had a girl say to me ""when you didn't call me for two days I was going to get back with you but then you called on the 3rd day so I decided not to. You should've let me think you didn't miss me."" Guys know that if they just act totally apathetic and don't fight for you that most girls will get insecure and think ""what the fuck? Why the hell isn't he chasing me? I must've meant nothing"" and get back in touch.  

But that opinion aside, really, why do you want him to contact you? Why do you care if you don't want him near you? Either admit that you want to forgive him and get back together or move on. Personally (and I'll get more downvotes for this) I think people don't think deeply enough about the differences between men and women sexually when it comes to cheating. Men and women cheat for different reasons. Men cheat in a way where it's like their wife doesn't like the smell of curry so they sneak to the Indian take away once per week. It's just like getting rid of a small urge. (Unless they're treating her like a 2nd girlfriend in which case it becomes a much bigger deal.) Women tend to cheat emotionally and physically. (I know, not all and everyone is an individual. I'm talking overall patterns here.)  

I think you should've talked to him about it properly rather than try to play this chasing game where he has to win you back. Because he doesn't know there's a game on. Or he does. Who knows? The only advice I can give is for you to be honest with yourself and whether you can forgive him or not."

"You‚Äôre right. I guess I just assumed there would be contact and thought that I wanted to get everything moved out and get the break up over with, then talk about it later once the shock had worn off. "
"Yes, this is what I was thinking too. Thanks. I‚Äôm moving on as best I can, these replies are helping a lot. "
Thank you. Your simple message is something I needed to hear. 
"Yes, absolutely right, thank you"
It sounds like you‚Äôre right. Maybe I just wanted to believe that our relationship was at least a little more meaningful than ‚Äúnot giving a single fuck about me‚Äù. 
"Wow. 
Thank you so much. 
I am crying a happy and empowering cry for the first time since I discovered the affair. Your reply makes me feel stronger. It makes me feel like I don‚Äôt want to hear from him. Your reply makes me want to take all the power I gave to him and put it back on me. 
I can‚Äôt tell you how much I appreciate your reply. "
"Amazing answer. Yes, you‚Äôre probably right, deep down I probably want the remorse and the begging for forgiveness so that I can proudly say I‚Äôm a strong woman who caught him red-handed and doesn‚Äôt need him anymore. I realize I‚Äôm not in a made-for-TV movie. Your response makes me realize that I‚Äôm looking for closure the wrong way. I‚Äôll be working on moving on, and I‚Äôll keep what you‚Äôve said in mind. Thank you. "
This is the harsh reality. 
"This answer is exactly what I need to hear. Thank you. No matter what is going on for him, it‚Äôs clear that he doesn‚Äôt care. I need to accept it and move on. Thank you so much for your response, this will definitely help me to start moving on. "
"These types of comments are not helpful. It's easy to say ""why do you care"" when you're not emotionally involved. There's nothing wrong with telling someone they have to move on and not wallow, but you have to acknowledge their distress about a 3 year relationship ending horribly."
"I guess I care because I invested years with him and we were weeks away from our new place and future. I know it‚Äôs easy to say ‚Äòforget him‚Äô, but feeling like after 3 years that our relationship was that meaningless to him, it‚Äôs very very tough.

I really appreciate you calling him an enema nozzle, that definitely made me smile. "
"Coward is a fitting word. He wanted out of the relationship to pursue something else, but instead of ending it like a man, he was instead  too much of a coward to end it. 

He's probably happy you ended it so he doesn't didn't have to. He checked out of it emotionally a long time ago. Asshole. 

You're better off without him. Find someone with emotional maturity. You deserve better."
"Thank you so much, this reply really hits home. "
It is his good friend‚Äôs apartment so I am assuming that he will take care of it. 
"Dude wanted OP to pull the trigger on this, sounds like. He knows why she left."
It was the first time I ever snooped. He always hid his phone from me or kept it as close to him as possible and turned down.
"Hey, I think you're very right about this, but I'm curious if you could give some examples of being able to read men's behaviour. "
"right? someone he's been seeing for around a month or so seems real appealing now, but he'll get bored soon enough. and he'll do the same thing to her, either by reaching out to OP or finding someone else. if he cheats with you, he'll cheat on you. he's an asshole. "
Downvoted for  repeated  ‚ÄúI‚Äôll get downvotes for this‚Äù. 
"He knows he cheated. He probably doesn't want to talk to you about it, and is fine with the way things ended."
The breakup was when you moved out. That was your opportunity to confront him and address any lingering issues. You‚Äôre just going to have to move on now. 
[deleted]
"You didn‚Äôt have to say anything. He knows. He probably isn‚Äôt contacting you because he doesn‚Äôt want to face it. He probably feels shitty and embarrassed that you caught him. And since he‚Äôs got someone else he‚Äôs probably spending a lot of time with them to make himself feel better. He‚Äôs possibly using the breakup for sympathy. I would be. 

I‚Äôve been in his situation before. This is likely what‚Äôs going on with him. Believe me though, he knows he fucked up and is gonna have a rough time when he lets himself face it. "
"He either knows why you broke up, or is relieved that you saved him from a moral dilemma of having to pick between you and his sidepiece. Either way, you broke things off, and it's good for you that he's not trying to keep in touch, because the best thing you can do is remind yourself that he already wasted enough of your time, and isn't worth another minute of it."
"Hey, I've been there. The only comfort there is in a situation like this, is knowing that you've got a chance for a better life now that you're away from him. That's something he'll never have, because he's going to have to live with himself for the rest of his life. Even if he never has the decency to be ashamed of himself, he's still going to have a hard time given the way he treats the people around him. It'll catch up to him, one way or another. You just won't be there to see it- the only thing you can really do is try to let it go and move on, which is admittedly easier said than done. 

As others have said, he knows *exactly* who he is and what he's done. Maybe he hasn't contacted you, for an explanation or otherwise, because he knows he doesn't deserve another second of your time. Leaving you alone might be the only decent thing he could possibly do."
It‚Äôs also okay to feel sad and betrayed OP! Feel your feelings. But also know how much better you are without him
"Good for you. I'm not sure why you originally thought you wanted to talk with him. I was really impressed with the first part of your post, where you saw something definitive, (admitted it was snooping, and for good reason), made a strong and difficult decision for yourself, and ended the relationship very cleanly. It sounds like you want some closure or to tell him he;s a jerk, whatever. But for yourself, you don't need to do this. Let it go. There's no benefit to you of clinging to the relationship. You've done so much to get away from it, keep calm and carry on! You got this! "
"No worries, PM me if you need anything"
"There will be two possible outcomes here.  One is that he was checked out of the relationship mentally a long time ago, especially with the cheating (found someone else to turn his relationship energy on).  So it isn't that he *never* gave a fuck, but that he's done his moving on already.   That's why you haven't heard from him.  The second option is that he is short-term fine with the breakup, but that long-term his new fling will fall apart, and he'll wake up to what he lost and come crawling back.   While it's satisfying to know he actually did care, it wouldn't change the final results; that he's a cheating jerk who isn't worth your time.  His decisions to cheat is not a reflection of your worth, it's completely a reflection of his character.  Which you now know is terrible.  "
"I understand completely, OP. I feel this way about relationships that ended in ghosting and were barely a fraction of yours, lol. It‚Äôs more than reasonable to expect and want someone you spent three years in a relationship with to care enough about you to not even necessarily fight for you, but to at least express discontent with the prospect of no longer being in a relationship with you. For him to not do that is a massive, excruciating slap in the face, I know. There‚Äôs no way to really sugarcoat it. I‚Äôm so sorry that happened to you. It‚Äôs hard to move on for sure. Let yourself grieve and mourn and cry or whatever. But don‚Äôt contact him. If he wanted to talk to you, he would. If he respected you as much as he should have, he wouldn‚Äôt have cheated on you. You deserve better, and he doesn‚Äôt deserve your attention anymore. At all. Best of luck with your healing. "
YAY! You got this! Come back to reddit if you need any moral support. You are showing how super strong you are! 
"I know you can do this! It also helped me to realize that the piece about breaking up with ANYone, is because we feel attachment. Allowing ourselves to feel attachment to other people is fundamentally healthy, and it reflects well on us...but it is the piece that stings when things break down. Unfortunately, our hearts don't always do a good job distinguishing between healthy attachment, and unhealthy. 

Realizing how disordered my ex was, went an ENORMOUS way towards helping me put down the burden of the relationship, because it helped bust up the residual attachment I was feeling. 

I just wanted to track this on as PS, because it kind of is one of those relationship things that seems super obvious in retrospect, but was something that I struggled with while I was in the throes of it all. That is, I couldn't understand why it still hurt so much initially . . . now I embrace that as a sign that I was myself experiencing healthy attachment (and it's sudden end) and I'm proud that I am built that way, you know? I'll take that over disordered, thank you.

Things are so, so much better in the other side, I promise. I'm five years out, have a partner who adores me, and life is really pretty simple these days, emotionally.

Also, my cheater ex looks like crap, heh.

Okay, that was petty. But it's deliciously true üòÜ..."
"> so that I can proudly say I‚Äôm a strong woman who caught him red-handed and doesn‚Äôt need him anymore

You can ALREADY say that. You caught him cheating and you ended the relationship. That takes a ton of strength! Be proud of yourself for making the right decision and don't waste any more time thinking about that idiot."
"dude, you are a strong woman. You saw he was cheating on you and you took immediate action to take care of yourself. That takes guts and strength and it‚Äôs pretty cool. 

But you‚Äôre also human and we all need to understand things to move on. He behaved like a coward because he didn‚Äôt even had the decency to show up to your own breakup (standing there doesn‚Äôt count as being present!). It‚Äôs like you want to feel that he cares enough to swallow his pride and ask you why but he doesn‚Äôt. He knows why, he‚Äôs a coward. 

Being strong does not mean that nothing affects you, it means that you can get up after you break. Seems like you‚Äôve got it, OP. "
"I've been through it before and it sucks.  I know you want to have it out with him, or have him beg you to come back, or whatever you happen to be thinking of in that minute, because with me it changed from minute to minute.  Eventually I got over it with time.  Also remember - the best way to get over one guy is to get under another guy.  lol  Not immediately, but don't become a hermit.  That's the best advice I have.  Stay strong."
I think wanting that or feeling that way is valid though. I would be hurt too and hoping that my partner of 3 years would put up more of a fight. You‚Äôre probably feeling really angry and hurt and didn‚Äôt have a chance to express it to the person who hurt you. Based on his behavior though he‚Äôs probably not someone who could responsibly handle those feelings. I hope you let yourself feel your feelings and that you‚Äôre getting lots of love and support from other relationships.
"I think this is a perfectly normal reaction and it‚Äôs how I‚Äôd want to feel if I dumped a cheater. Unfortunately, I think if this is the moment you wanted out of your breakup you needed to get this at the point of breaking up with him. The relationship is over now and you missed your chance to say your piece by trying to act coy instead. A lot of us have been there, when I broke off my first serious relationship because he was a liar and drug addict, there were a lot of things I didn‚Äôt say that I wished I had; I wanted him to really feel guilty for his actions- but the fact is he did not, that‚Äôs why he was happy to do it in the first place- I didn‚Äôt hear from him again for 5 years. 
Unfortunately a lot of people (including myself) are firm believers in a clean break and it‚Äôs unlikely you‚Äôll hear from him again in a long time unless you choose to contact him yourself (which I do not advise)"
seriously. why are so many comments here like that? jeez
"They are totally helpful, I'm a 2x victim of cheating and nothing helps you move on like realising the person you left was actually a human shitbag."
"Hey OP I know where you're coming from. Everyone is not wrong in saying you need to move on, but you're allowed to have a little grieving time! You're right, 3 years is a lot to invest in someone and it's really really hard to just have to throw that away. So yes please move along towards what you truly deserve, but don't be afraid to remember him (especially in the context of what to stay away from in the future lol)."
"The problem is that you are looking to the enema nozzle for closure and affirmation.

You don't need him to validate the 3 years you invested in him. That relationship is what is to you. You get to decide how you value it. You get to decide what you gained from it. You get to decide what place it holds in your life at large. You create the closure from it you need.

Don't expect any emotional honesty or depth from a man who was so willing to lie to you and who threw everything he had away."
Don‚Äôt assume. Take care of it yourself. 
Seconding /u/AlmaReville.  Get yourself off the lease or he could stop paying rent and hurt your credit.
You cannot make that assumption. Call the landlord IMMEDIATELY and get your name off that lease.
"He's also probably waiting for you to reach out when you're ready, because you still have to take care of the lease and pay rent."
"Can you not?
Just take care of it yourself. Don't rely on other people and don't assume things will be taken care of.
Show the same initiative you did when you dropped this loser."
"And the one time he chose not to do that was after he'd been cheating for a month, hadn't deleted any of the texts, and hadn't done a very good job of hiding his behavior (you said you were suspicious, so he must have been doing something out of the ordinary).  I mean, really?  He, at least subconsciously, wanted you to find out and knows that you did.  You left him within 24 hours of the first time he left his phone accessible to you.  It's not rocket science.  "
"If he's done this the entirety of your relationship then he's a serial cheater. You're not the first woman to suddenly break it off with him, I guarantee it. Hiding his phone from you should have been reason enough to break this off. Don't accept shadyness from a partner ever."
"Closure is overrated. He didn‚Äôt chase after you, so it feels open-ended, but it‚Äôs not."
"Not clearing out texts is a rookie move. He wanted to get caught to cause a break up because he didn't have the guts to do so on his own.

It's over. He's not chasing you."
"it's crazy how you could cheat on someone, but want to be with them enough to sign a lease with them, but then also accept being broken up with without explanation, not even caring. what is wrong with people? "
"OR he's using OP's sudden breakup as a reason to paint himself as the victim. ""I have no idea, she left me in the lurch as we were moving, she never told me why"" etc."
"YES! OP, if you weren't strong, you would still be in a relationship with him, knowing about the cheating but not doing anything about it. or you'd have thrown it in his face but offered him another chance. you put your foot down and got the fuck out of there, which is really hard to do. "
I view closure as internal. It‚Äôs not something anyone else can give you. It is you internally processing the issue and moving on. 
"There are a lot of selfish users out there, sadly. This jerk was probably feeling ""meh"" about OP and decided to cheat for a little excitement but still wanted to sign the lease because it makes his life easier to have 50% of the rent subsidized. When OP dumped him he probably just shrugged his shoulders and thought ""Well, that plan didn't work out - glad I lined up a new girl...""

It's awful, really. So many selfish assholes out there."
I just like to think of them as assholes.. was with a dude who went with his family to buy me an engagement ring during the day and the same night meet up with another girl.. SMH..
"That's what closure is. You can take it from someone, but any time someone is talking about closure it's always one sided. The offending party rarely reaches out to make sure the one they hurt was OK. Its always the victim seeking something. And the something is usually a reason why that person hurt and treated them poorly. And theres never a reason to hurt someone that makes any rational sense."
oof I need this stamped on the back of my hand or something! I'm always trying to get it from the guys I date.. but I realize that letting go in my mind is what I really need. 
"ugh. that's surely what happened. based on my experiences with men (a lot) and all the stories i read on here, i literally couldn't be more cynical about relationships/men. it's terrifying how easily some people toss you away. "
oh my fucking god. i'm so sorry. it's so scary how people can show you one thing and do exactly the opposite. how they can act like they love you but cheat on you so easily and then not care about the relationship ending. it's like all the time you've spent is meaningless. how can you ever trust anyone?
"Sociopaths of both genders exist, as do decent people. A couple of stories of shitty people shouldn't make you afraid of dating."
No advice...just wanted to say I know exactly where you're coming from. This sub is like the nail on the coffin for me and dating. 
"it's way more than a couple, and with how bad it's been with most guys in my life, i can't help feeling like i feel about it. 

and clearly both genders can be assholes. i mentioned only men because i've only ever been romantically involved with men. "
glad someone else understands and I‚Äôm not just being dramatic. Much love 
"Yeah, but this is also a place specifically designated for people to talk about shitty things that are happening in their relationships. If you're getting to the point where reading about other people's relationship issues is making you cynical and jaded it might be time to take a break from here for your own happiness."
i've been cynical for a long time and just started reading this sub a few weeks ago. the damage was already done but thx
"For what it's worth, I'm sorry for being so presumptuous with my previous response."
"I think you did a few things right.

1. You apologized.
2. You have asked how to be a better person [on Reddit]
3. You seem to feel guilty about it. 

But there is a lot going on that... went wrong. You yelled at your friend, attacked her personally/personality, you keep wanting to clarify when she has made it clear she's done. 

This is one of those situations where the best outcome isn't going to be friendship. She was probably very hurt by what you did and spent four months coming to terms with your ""break up."" Even if she forgives you, it doesn't mean she wants you in her life. 

And I agree with her. You guys are not going to be friends anytime soon. Time might allow a friendship in the future, but you have to be willing to change a lot about your communication style with her. 

I really think you need to talk to someone about your ex-boyfriend. Instead of telling her, ""Hey, this is making me really upset, can we take a breather?"" you attacked her personality. 

And that's not okay. 

Your ex boyfriend is the only one who did that to you. No one else. No one else should have to worry about you unloading your past onto them like that."
"If you think she misconstrued what you were trying to say it‚Äôs okay to attempt to clarify it 

BUT you also need to understand that she just might not be interested in being your friend anymore.  She may ‚Äúforgive‚Äù you and still feel she just doesn‚Äôt need you in her life anymore and would rather just move on.  If she feels that way, there might not be the perfect apology that will change her mind. "
I would talk to her in person instead of text message to convey clearer sentiments and show you value this friendship and want to forward
"Thank you for your reply.

I just like to clarify some things:
I never yelled at her. My last contact was also through  a messanger so there was no way I could have yelled at her.

I also didn't want to keep clarifying things.
I only replied to her message yesterday once basically saying ""ok, that is unfortunate.""

I never even knew she was mad at me that day because she spend the day with me after  the argument  and only told me a week later that she didn't like my arguing style.

I hope this cleans up some misunderstandings.

So do you suggest I leave her alone  or send another  message?"
I have no means of talking to her in person if she doesn't agree to to meet up. She lives in a different town.
What do you feel will make your feel better? Do you feel like one more message will help you drop the topic? Because at this point one more message isn't going to really change much. 
"I am not really doing this to make myself feel better. Though I would feel better if there was a chance to save this  friendship. But it's hard to find the courage  to give it another  try.
I have no idea if it does and I am not sure if I failed with  my apology by appearing I just  want her to forget it so it's easier for me. And at the same time, I don't want to make a fool of myself by appearing  clingy.

There is nothing  else I could do either to apologize. I never see her."
"Petty jealousies have destroyed every mixed-sex 'friend group' I've been a part of since I was 14.  The other girls might not like her personality or the attention she gets, they might not like that she's younger or that she lives a libertine lifestyle. It might be genuine dislike, moral disapproval, or jealousy. 

In any case there is truly nothing you can do. Big groups of friends are great and you should hold onto them if you can, but they're so hard to maintain in the face of petty arguments, unrealized crushes, grudges, etc. My advice is just to maintain your strongest friendships and let the new/splinter groups form naturally."
"You've tried to talk to the three girls, if they don't want to listen to you defending Abbie, you can't really do anything. People are well within their rights to not hang out with people they don't like. You feel bad that the group is ending, but you are not responsible for keeping it together."
"Tell your roomie to google ""geek social fallacies."" Maybe even do that together, and discuss what you find with her, and use it as a talking point, explaining that your boundaries are reasonable, and her lack of respect for your autonomy is starting to affect your friendship with her. One of the primary things you'll (she'll) learn is that friendship is not transitive. Just because she is friends with two different people, doesn't mean they have to be friends with each other. It doesn't even have to mean you don't like her. It sounds like you never had a friendship with Ariana, and you shouldn't be expected to be her friend now, just because she's had  a rough time. Pity isn't a basis for friendship, otherwise you'd all go around befriending every drama llama or sad sack around campus, not just Ariana. Another things you'll/she'll learn is that it's not ""mean"" to exclude people based on their own bad behavior. 

If your roommate accuses you of bullying, ask her which sounds more like a bully - you, someone trying to avoid a person who behaved hurtfully toward them; or her, someone trying to violate that reasonable boundary by pressuring another to act ""nice"" to someone who has a history of unreasonable behavior with you?  Just because you don't like someone doesn't make you ""mean.""  Tell her that, and tell her that everyone gets to choose their own friends. That's a pretty basic and reasonable boundary. You're not telling her who to befriend or who to exclude, and she shouldn't be asking that of you, either. Maybe also suggest to your roommate that therapy could help her figure out reasonable adult boundaries, since she seems to be struggling in this area. 

And don't get sidetracked into a discussion about forgiveness or ""being the bigger person,"" because Ariana hasn't even expressed that she thinks she behaved poorly at all. Given that, there's no reason to think she won't behave poorly again.  It's not about forgiveness, it's about self-protection, and/or just about surrounding yourself with people you enjoy. "
"No. No. No. I did this for my best friend, it never ends good. If this girl is toxic, even though it will feel bad saying no the first few times, just keep saying no, they will eventually stop asking

"
"You already gave her an answer, it's up to her to accept it. You don't like Ariana, you don't have to be around her. If she tries to force you then let her know you don't appreciate it and you'll have to distance yourself from her too."
"You don't have to like everyone.  And you don't have to be friends with all of the friends-of-your-friends.

It's okay to say, ""I don't like the way Arianna has behaved towardme, in the past, and I don't want to be around her.  If you want to hang out with her, that's your choice, but I don't want to be included in any activities where she'll be present.""

That is NOT bullying or divisive.  It is establishing a clear boundary to establish space from a toxic person."
"""I don't need to give you a reason for not wanting to be friends with Ariana. You do your thing, I'll do mine."""
"I googled it myself and read through them and I‚Äôd say my friend group struggled with practically all of them. Especially the ‚Äòfriendship is transitive‚Äô and ‚Äòfriends do everything together‚Äô which constantly guilted me into going to events that I did not want to go to and be surrounded by more people who made me uncomfortable. Honestly, though? I‚Äôm afraid bringing this to my roommate would be perceived as hostile. I‚Äôm not good with confrontation and when she and I get into it..which are other stories on their own.. I face silence rather than a discussion. Sometimes I don‚Äôt even know why she‚Äôs upset. It‚Äôs easier just to let it go and avoid conflict sometimes. I love her dearly, we‚Äôve known each other since the 6th grade. But she‚Äôs hot headed. I don‚Äôt know how to express my feelings without her feeling attacked which I do not want."
Thank you for your advice! I appreciate your input. I‚Äôm sorry that a situation ended badly for you.
Thank you for your advice! I appreciate it. You‚Äôre absolutely right. 
"Maybe as a starting point, separately from a discussion specifically about Ariana, tell her (and/or maybe post it to your whole group?) that you came across this article (the Geek Social Fallacies) and you thought it was interesting and it made you think about some things in a new way (maybe even say you find it makes a lot of valid points?), and you wonder what everyone else's thoughts are on it?"
"Why isn't he taking his own initiative? Why is it your job to manage his feelings?

Why aren't you putting your foot down?"
The only thing to do is learn your lesson and take it into your next relationship. Starting fights on purpose for dumb reasons? Probably not a good idea. You can't expect the person you're dating to solve your mental health problems. 
"You talked about how she made your problems feel better, but what about how you helped her with her problems?

You should take time to reevaluate how you see a relationship. You should base a relationship off of how much you like how the person makes you feel. I'll try and say it nicely, but saying you like her because she makes you less anxious is selfish of you. A relationship is not based on what you get out of it, it's based on what do you want for the other person. If you were with her still, I could guarantee all your anxiety and OCD and ADHD would all come back eventually. A person is not a cure for your problems. She can't give you the parts of yourself you feel are missing, you have to find those yourself.

I've been down the road you are on, and there is a way out. There is a way to be better and feel great and say, ""Anxiety, fuck it, not dealing with you today."" Then you can go into a relationship with only expectations to give and not to take."
"Take it as a lesson learned. Moving so fast is a red flag for relationships. Things burned hot and bright, and then burned out. It wasn't sustainable.  

And her asking you what's wrong multiple times a day isn't an expression of love, it's an expression of the fact that multiple times a day she was uneasy about something, either something about you, or the relationship, or even herself.

I think a combination of a couple of things is making this harder for you:

 One is that your relationship was still in the honeymoon phase, so you're thinking it would've continued like that, but the rate you were going wasn't sustainable. You didn't go through the boring/work parts of a relationship with her yet. You were so much still in the blinded-by-happiness honeymoon phase that couldn't see how unhappy she was when everyone else around her could (or you never saw it because she was subconsciously using you to escape her unhappiness instead of facing whatever her problems are, so she WAS happy with you, but partially in an almost manic, in-denial fantasy-land kind of way that allowed her to temporarily be ""someone else"" with you, avoiding her ""real self"" problems, which obviously is not sustainable). Also, as a manifestation of still being in the honeymoon phase, is that you're idealizing her, saying that she ""made your life feel perfect."" That's a lot of responsibility to give one person, a lot of pressure. It sounds like maybe you were both using the relationship as an escape from ""real life.""

 Another is that you're attributing your improved mental health to her companionship, and now you think you've not only lost your GF, but also your ""cure."" Don't sell yourself short. Isn't it likely that you were on an upswing, which made things ""smoother"" with her? That you were feeling better, which comes along with a boost in confidence, more visible inner peace (or less visible stress), and happiness (even if you hadn't noticed these things yet, as it was probably a gradual change), and thus, with your mind less preoccupied, you became more aware of people around you, including this woman, and also with those changes, other people became more aware of you, like ""Hey, who's that guy? I've never noticed him before...""

So, consider those things. Now, do what is best for you. You can still be the guy you were with her, but be that guy without her. Involve and immerse yourself in the people and things/activities around you, keep up with your mental health treatment plan, explore some new hobbies or places, etc. "
"She never really told me much besides ""I really like you"" and ""you make me happy"". She told me ""you mean the world to me"" multiple times, but I never got a reason why. I thought if she wasn't happy the last time we hung, I'd just let go because we've never spent time together where she didn't show signs of happiness. But then she flipped from cold to warm and loving again."
"My partner was married to a Jehovah‚Äôs Witness. Not sure if this is the one, but it sounds quite similar. She woke up eventually and left the religion and had to start a new life with no family or friends. The issue was that when she left the religion, she suddenly found herself at 24 with no one and no life experience. So she divorced my boyfriend and went off to have a varied life. 

I‚Äôm telling you this to really drive home that you never know how it‚Äôll turn out. If she leaves the religion for you, she may wind up resenting you because she lost her entire life for you. She may end up lonely or depressed. You could end up having to teach her to be a person living in the world untouched by religion (doctors and female health care and mental health care). 

For now, just try to move on instead of focusing on being patient. Be there for her, be open and have as much communication as you can handle. But try to keep your life whole and moving forward. She might leave...she might not. And you can‚Äôt wait forever. "
[removed]
"Actually you are better off in the long run. It might not seem like it now but in time.    


You need support of family and friends to make relationships work.  Your situation doesn‚Äôt allow that.  


You need to made yourself extremely busy.  You need to work - start early and stay late, volunteer at something that matters, do chores around the house, go to the gym, join a sports team, help out Grandma, read a book, plan a trip.  


Fill all of your hours with meaningful activities that is how you move on. "
Thanks for the perspective.

"I probably would stay away from space in a situation like this. Whatever good happens to her (excitement, success, etc..) during the space she will attribute to that subconsciously. It's tough to transition to that stage of a relationship for everyone, but especially when it happens to your partner in a different way. The only thing you can do is ask yourself if you want her as a lifetime partner. If you do, show her that however you can. If she wants the same thing she'll get used to the new dynamic. Good luck man that's a tough situation"
Make a scrapbook of your favorite times together throughout the years as a reminder of all the happy moments you‚Äôve had. 
"Try travelling, or try some new activities with her"
"> I know this is natural after awhile

it's not normal and 3 years is not even that long."
Maybe space is the wrong word. We see each other most days and talk on the phone during every free moment we have. We've been this way since we started dating and we seem to have just grown used to each other. We're talking like maybe not hanging out as much or chatting as often. Not a full on break.
"I would tell you to be very careful. Bad things do happen and sometimes we all need space to deal with it on our own but if she seems happier on her own for long periods of time and it doesn‚Äôt seem like she wants to communicate anymore, that‚Äôs a big red flag.

Do you really want to be the one she calls only when she feels like it? Would you go another 5 months with this kind of relationship?

Take this time away from her to really focus on yourself, go out, do something productive but I wouldn‚Äôt trust her. Speaking from past experience."
"Honestly, it sounds like you might do better by not being with her. You shouldn't be going two weeks without seeing each-other because she more or less doesn't feel like it. I think that the pain is not worth it. It sounds like she isn't really committed to you or the relationship because she doesn't seem to be taking into account your desire to see her. I would be careful, have a good long think about the sorts of things that you desire in a relationship, and see if what you have currently is what you want. At the end of the day you are the most important person to yourself, and if you're in a situation where you feel like you are losing out, it might be best to let go."
It sounds like you feel insecure. The long-distance and living in separate countries doesn't help. How long until you two live together again?
Have you ever read any of these texts?  Has she ever offered for you to read any of these texts?

You‚Äôre 31. Get your own place. The tension is they are sick of you
">I realize that I'm the one who's in the wrong, and that I need to make the necessary lifestyle changes to resolve these tensions.

Your post is way too vague to give advice."
"Why cut down on social life. You are 31 - do you plan to be alone forever?

Grow up and get your own place. "
What are these lifestyle differences?
Sorry but there's no way you'll be able to live on your terms under their roof and especially when it comes to Asian parents this could be a constant source of friction and nagging. It won't be the worst thing but it will take its toll over time. You can give it a go but be prepared to have a backup plan if you find things getting difficult.
"You have a job in the Bay Area. Either you have a fancy tech job that pays you enough that you can move out, even if your commute will be worse. If you do not have a fancy tech job, you can move out by moving to a lower cost of living area - there's no reason to stick around the Bay Area to be a retail manager."

"No, you're not right to be mad. It's ludicrous to expect fidelity from someone you dumped and is super duper shitty if you give her even a modicum of a hard time about this. Single people make out with others sometimes.

*Don't be a jerkkkk*"
"Okay, you left her. You dumped her and she rebounded.

You have no right to be angry or disgusted because that's the same as refusing to date somebody because they made out with someone else shortly before you became official.

If you didn't want this to happen, you shouldn't have dumped her. You don't have the right to be disgusted just because she made a stupid mistake while *single*"
She was single at the time and did nothing wrong. Get over it.
"People need to learn how to face themselves and take responsibility for the decisions they make.

I won't even touch the fact that **you** broke up with her since you already mentioned it, you already know you're in the wrong. You are upset because you feel, whether consciously or subconsciously, that you play by different rules and/or your happiness is more important than hers. I would understand being upset if your situations were reversed. But, you made the decision to end the relationship, essentially saying that my desires are more important than you having any part in my life.

How was she supposed to move forward? Mourn the loss of your love for 40 Days and join a nunnery? You only care because it's a strike to your ego, you're not as amazing as you thought. This girl and maybe others *can* move past you.

I know you will most likely stay in a relationship with her despite advice otherwise, because nobody ever fucking listens. However, in the following days, months, years of your relationship with her, I ask you to regularly think about why you are experiencing a certain feeling about your interactions with your girlfriend, and if they could stand up to an impartial court. This will help keep you grounded and hopefully move you in the right direction."
"She can make out with anyone ahe wants when she is single.


But I think you are better off just letting this go and not ""getting back together"". There's a reason you broke up, and nothing major changes in 4 days...you guys just don't know how to communicate."

He's an immature dirtbag. Time to move on.
[deleted]
"Stop apologizing to him. He's acting really rude to the person he's supposed to be love with and not giving you any respect. Yeah you went a bit overboard, but what he's doing is worse. He's probably cheating and doesn't seem to care. I hope you are cutting him off. "

"Go right now and look up the sunk cost fallacy, because you're living in it."
"Compassion is noble but it so easily turns into enabling and codependency if you aren't careful. Compassion doesn't mean staying on the Titanic out of sympathy with the victims knowing you aren't actually helping, when you can easily get on a lifeboat and find safety. Sacrifice should be toward accomplishing something.  Long ago you stopped achieving anything by standing by this person. "
"I went through a similar thing with my ex. He was depressed but would not talk about, or admit it. We were together for over five years, but I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. I felt like the relationship was lasting because I was willing to tolerate the state of things (which were not great) I the end I walked. 

You are only responsible for your 50% part of a relationship. If sometimes a partner is ill or sick you compensate, but if it I stuck in an 80-90% chances are needed. If that is him going to therapy or you breaking up I don‚Äôt know. But in my case I wanted a relationship with someone who could be on my team. My ex couldn‚Äôt even be on his own team. You don‚Äôt owe anyone you unhappiness, even if they suffer form mental illness. You are not responsible for his metal health or his life. "
"After five years, this guy is who he is and is unlikely to change. If things stay exactly as they are, how much longer are you willing to stay? A month? A year? Five? Ten? 

Life is beautiful but it's so, so short. I think you know you have better options out there and could find somebody who works on their personal issues, feels thankful for the good things in their life, and will go out in the sunlight with you instead of holing up. 

I'm absolutely not trying to be callous--my partner and I both have mental illnesses, and it's not easy to deal with. Mental illness is tough and the effort that a person has to put into treating it can definitely be daunting. But it sounds like this guy is adding stress to your life instead of joy. "
"No it's totally normal to want alone time. 

If he's not working, is he there all the time? 

How long is he planning not to work for? A stay-cation usually implies you have a job to go back to. "
"Introvert here. Kids are work, to be sure, but there are ways to get Alone time when you have them. Going for a walk by yourself, carving  out space daily to meditate, having your SO take the kids out so you can catch up on your stuff, reading while they nap. 

Very doable. "
"You are not wrong to need space and alone time - it's not a need that goes away when you become a parent, and its not detrimental to your role as a parent. If anything, acknowledging and fulfilling the need will help you be a better parent.   
But, this post raises another question: how is he paying his portion of the bills while he takes this *staycation*? (or is he relying upon you to keep the lights on while he takes a break from adulting?)"
You can have kids and be an introvert.  You can still get some alone time.  That‚Äôs why we give them early bed times and make them take naps.  
"Tell him you agree that you want alone time, and have him pick a night each week where he'll be out of the house for 4 hours. You can also ask that a half day each weekend be free, he can go do an outside activity while you do your own thing at home.

Tell him if it's important to you that you don't have to entertain him and appreciate time to recharge by yourself in order to have better time together.

You can also choose an amount of time to tune him out, and say ""I think I want an hour to (listen to a podcast/play a videogame/watch something/read/take a walk) undisturbed, and then let's hang out together after.""

It's ok to really value quiet time. This really has nothing to do with whether you'd be a fit parent.

Finally, something that hugely helped me in my introvert/extrovert partnership: we both read the book ""Quiet"" by Susan Cain, and I highly recommend it. It's an awesome conversation starter and I felt as though I understood so much more about my partner after. Our communication and habits have improved and there's a healthy freedom there."
"You guys have the money to frequent coffee shops or rent an Airbnb occasionally, so why not alternate doing that so you each get alone time?"
"Can you guys get a bigger apartment?  If money isn't a problem I don't understand why you're both cooped up in a tiny apartment, especially if he's staying at home for awhile.

And before you have kids, make sure your husband is agreeable to taking the kids sometimes so you can get your alone time."
I think it‚Äôs pretty normal. My husband and I are both like this. We just spend time in other areas doing our hobbies. It‚Äôs also a big reason we don‚Äôt want kids. 
"Wait, so up and quitting your job to stay at home for a month is the Hallmark of an excellent provider, but good forbid you should need an instant of alone time? Are you sure *he* would be a good parent? You already know he's a judgemental hypocrite. "
That's what I was thinking. He's just willfully unemployed. 
He's there all the time. We've not discussed when/if he will be returning to work (He has a passive income which nearly matches what I make at my job)
He still gets enough income to pay half of the expenses; We selected such a small apartment so that we could scrape by on only his passive income (if absolutely needed)
"Not really. Money isn't an issue here, but it isn't infinite; we're stable, not wealthy.

We make about the same, so if he did get a job then the only way we could afford a bigger place is if he started paying more than half."
He's got passive income which is sufficient to fund all of our expenses; He has no trouble providing his half of the expenses.
That's not going to make a good father is it?!
How do I get one if those deals :p But like it sounds like it might be good for him to pick up an out if the house hobby find a bit.
"So is he planning to be the stay at home father for your kids? It could work really well, but I'm sure if he was actually doing something with his day, he'd appreciate alone time a lot more"
"That's not what I'm saying; ""Wait, so up and quitting your job **to stay at home for a month**...""

There's a big difference between quitting your job and deciding to turn your attention to volunteerism, education, hobbies, etc. (which is so excellent if you can afford it!) and quitting your job to stay at home and make your girlfriend feel like a bad not-yet mother for needing an instant away from you (which is not so excellent at all.) Being a parent is WAY more than providing financially. Even if he does have that passive income, what if he needs to go back to work? How is he going to explain his employment gap? If he was traveling, volunteering, getting an education, then going back to work eventually wouldn't be difficult. But having nothing to show for this time is going to hurt his ability to be employed in the future should it become necessary."
Considering she said his passive income is almost as much as her salary and the fact that he would be home all the time I would think that would make a good father lol.
"Go to Iraq, get PTSD and fuck up one of your knees. 

I'm pressuring volunteerism. He can't seem to find a job that he's happy with, probably since in his mind he doesn't actually HAVE to work anymore"
Don't you think you're being a bit extreme there? I highly doubt a future employer will be scarred by someone having a month holiday. It's not exactly a substantial 'employment gap' and for all you know they could indeed be indulging in hobbies. 
"She says he's home all of the time and thinks it's a her problem that she needs some space. And a months employment gap in most fields wouldn't be that big of a deal, but she doesn't mention him looking for employment or volunteer opportunities. You don't find a job in one day anymore. "

"You might be able to achieve a similar look by cuffing the sleeves on a standard fit T-shirt. For me, Uniqlo's supima shirts are the perfect length for cuffing twice, and they cost $10 each."

"The site calls those oxfords, which is really stretching the term IMO. Those just look like sneakers made formal in a way that might make you look like your dad trying to look younger. Have you tried looking at leather boots like chukkas or typical lace-up boots?"
"Check out Svensson, Greats, Grenson."
I have CPs and Gustins. They're very similar.
H&M or something similar during Winter.
White
"White for sure. Navy is going to be too dark, maybe really light blue could work as well but white is your best option imo."
Tennis clothes?
"Honestly if you're actually playing a match you should wear clothes similar to what you would work out in. A polo shirt is customary but obviously one made from ""techy"" materials (think nike dri-fit or similar) and not 100% cotton. I wear one from lululemon that looks good and performs well. Obviously wear shorts as well."
What have you tried so far and how big are you?
"H&M, GAP, Topman, Zara, etc. For this age, longevity isn't really required as they will grow up/wear them out anyway. Replace Adidas track pants with similar adidas trackpants tbh. Alternatively, get them jeans. "
can you be more specific on the style? got maybe any pictures you have as inspiration? out of the box goth sounds like a character from Beetlejuice.

Ah sorry. I know a few good UK places (All Saints) for proper slim fit t-shirts. Although I have had good luck with Ralph Lauren 'custom fit' t-shirts too.
Don‚Äôt wear brown shoes with black trousers. 
I just don't think it's needed if you use proper detergents and stuff. Vinegar doesn't feel to me like something I want to put on my clothing.

Hiking stores also carry similar socks. I have a couple of  pretty decent pairs from timberland that are better in warm weather than the Costco ones."
Jcrew has decent ones for cheap. Pick them up for like $5 a pair or so during big sales. 
Uniqlo has some similar looking ones I think but they‚Äôre probably thinner.

And criticizing that delusion is very apropos/relevant, as the style being touted as ""Californian Workwear"" is your average Southwestern/Country style. i.e. Not California-specific"
"Yes, and the guy says verbatim that "" California has led the way in terms of showing how people can dress more comfortably and casually in warmer climes."" and ""California also has a workwear style that‚Äôs distinct..."" from other styles, but it's literally the same style that's pervasive across the Southwest.

"Carthage was an empire in North Africa that engaged in three long, bitter wars with Rome (the Punic Wars). After Rome finally defeated Carthage, Rome destroyed its capital and legend says they dumped salt in the soil so no crops could grow there."
"After Rome got to Carthage to force Hannibal to abandon his invasion, they supposedly salted the everliving fuck out of all the agricultural land, which was a common practice to make the soil infertile so they could no longer grow crops to sustain their population. It's a reference to Roman era European history."
"There's a bunch of Californians in the culinary community that pretend that In-N-Out is a cultural phenomenon that's unique to Cali.

When ""cheap burgers and shakes"" is a common thing across the country, just that some regions like the Midwest drown stuff in ranch."
"I've heard Californians (Usually LA-types) claim that it is the originator/epicenter of a thing.

Be it ""burger culture"" (Alvin Cailan in First We Feast's Burger Show.) or car ""culture"", or in this case, claiming a style that was pervasive across a region to be ""Californian""

And I doubt I'll ever be in CA. Only reason I would  have to be there is if Tycho was gonna let me tour his studio, and even then I wouldn't exactly be thrilled with being in Sacramento."

"To be fair though, the anti-Elon-Musk-fans give him more than ""any criticism"". Not much of a fanboy myself, but he does more for the world than most people with that amount of money. You don't see Jeff Bezos getting the same hate. "
Yeah but Jeff Bezos doesn't call ppl pedos on Twitter or start fights with the Sierra club. He quietly takes over the media and probably the world soon
"So, basically, he's a bit of a douche at times, and very unprofessional, but nobody is perfect. People like Musk because he's trying to do something good for this world, not because he's an infallible messiah. He's still better than his peers.

Lol but I am from the surface of Venus where average temperatures regularly exceed 800¬∞F how the fuck am I supposed to wear a blazer in summer. Stupid article.

You dont
"Why do all the models appear bow-legged in this article? Is it the cut of the pants, or is that Mr. Porter acknowledging that these fits will leave you so overheated that you'll need a wide stance to avoid ""swamp crotch""?

Probably the 6th best way to wear a blazer this summer is to roll up the sleeves, cut out the armpits, cut a lattice pattern into the back, strap an ice pack under each arm, then pair it with a formal speedo and gladiator sandals."
Anyone got any suggestions for slightly more affordable blazers?
Always slim fit. I need fat fit.
"Yeah, when the humidex is 40+ I‚Äôm thinking the best advice on blazers is ‚Äúdon‚Äôt.‚Äù"

"Wear a blazer, but make sure it‚Äôs three things. Lightweight fabric (linen/wool blend, fresco wool, or seersucker cotton are the best options), unlined (or partial/butterfly lined at most) and lightly structured (minimum shoulder padding, half canvased). 

And make sure it‚Äôs not a snug/slim fit. Having a little room in the jacket will not only let you move a little more freely, but it will allow airflow as well to help keep you cool. "
"CardIgan? Just a shirt? 

Most the blazers listed here are unstructured (no shoulder padding) and unlined (no lining) so they'll be more breathable, especially if you opt for linen, seersucker or blends of those two."
Ha! I missed that. The red one and the 3 button are for sure too short.

"Congratulations, you‚Äôre not the target demographic for this article. "
"that's not accurate... I don't have to wear a blazer by any means, but to say that shorts and shortsleeves are appropriate for work (unless your a caddy or valet) is ridiculous. Shorts and shortsleeves seems appropriate for jobs that I would've had at age 18, but not in adulthood."
"You're welcome, glad you find it helpful. "
"I'm thinking more of black turtleneck and jeans, treating the blazer like outerwear. Alright I'll give it a try. Now is not the weather for it lol"
"Sweden, but as I mentioned last few weeks we had constantly high 70F which is what i heard is much above normal.  "
"We had 120f felt temp almost all week last week here and I walking around with black fitted jeans and a black t-shirt almost every day. Then again you'd likely never catch me wearing shorts and a tank outside of the gym...

"
I live in DFW and i still rock this look and just pretend to be comfortable.
6/7 days a week here in STL. that‚Äôs me. 
"Okay, but the biggest thing here is if someone‚Äôs forcing you to wear a blazer. If not, then don‚Äôt wear one. If you are required to wear one (or just want to wear one), then get a lightweight blazer, made with a breathable fabric, unlined, unstructured, and shove it in your bag on the way to work and put it on when you get there. Good fabrics won‚Äôt be too wrinkly even after those conditions. 

This article clearly mentions dress codes. If it doesn‚Äôt apply to you, great. It‚Äôs advice for people who it does apply to. 

Also, regarding the humidity. That‚Äôs your fault for living in Houston. "
Vancouver is basically Seattle lite. 
Getting way off topic here but didn't some oil company fund a study that proved climate change several decades ago and then buried it when they realized they were (partly) causing it? 
"But how would it be warming, if that is what is really happening?

Edit: I'm just going to leave this here, /s"
and that's why i happily work where i work! 
"In comparison to previous summers, this one hasn't been all that bad thanks to the storms and spontaneous African dust."
"Wel, at night here in the DFW, it‚Äôs possible. Blazer and a nice T shirt under. As long as you‚Äôre not out of an air condition building for too long lol"
It's more Asian up here in my experience.
"I vaguely remember an article/expos√© about that. iirc, the oil company then misdirected the blame for climate change to other sources, similar to how the sugar industry misdirected the blame for obesity to fats / fatty foods."
"If the dress code is the only thing that makes you happy at work, I feel sorry for you. "
"nah, it's the freedom and respect they give me which is shown by things like not making me wear blazers in summer. .. or ever. but whatever works for ya."
"Taking a (very) brief look at where you typically hang out on Reddit, I‚Äôm assuming you‚Äôre a mechanic. Is that correct?"
"negative. i'm an engineer. i work in an office, sit at a desk, go in the field sometimes, design stuff on computers, etc. turned down an interview at space x for this job so i didn't have to be a cog in a corporate hell hole making me wear nonsense to work for no reason other than protocol. "
"Well again, congratulations. Why are you even here on this subreddit anyway if you have it so good? The high horse give you too far of a view to see what the plebs are doing?"
Plebs? By my hobbies you thought I was a lowly mechanic and I assume you were going to point out I dont need a blazer for my mechanic work. But now that I'm went to one of the top aerospace programs in the country I'm on a high horse... get fucked. Have fun sweating all summer. 
"You‚Äôre assuming I think I‚Äôm above mechanics, and I couldn‚Äôt been a bit more tactful with how I brought that up. I don‚Äôt have a problem with anyone making an honest living. You‚Äôre still on the high horse about your company‚Äôs super lax dress code (which I‚Äôm sure your boss probably wishes you‚Äôd put at least a little effort into) coming into a page you care nothing about to tell people they‚Äôre being disrespected by their employers. And I will have fun at work in my blazer because I know how to wear one that doesn‚Äôt burn me up. "
"you're ""sure"" you know what my boss expects from me more than i do... i believe he laughed and said ""i dont care what the fuck you do with your hair"" when i asked him how he felt if i dreaded my hair soon. apparently some people feel the quality of your work is more important than how breathable your blazer collection gets. ""you're not your fuckin khakis"""
"tan is style consultant from a show called queer eye. the show is about 5 gay guys that makeover a person (usually a straight man) in 5 different aspects of their life. it‚Äôs a pretty good show if you‚Äôre looking for something to watch on netflix. i like his advice because it‚Äôs not just cookie cutter advice he gives to everyone. 

i only typed this out to give a little background on who this man is if you were wondering "
After the first guy I was really hoping he was just going to slap a leather jacket on all of them
"Interesting choice with the no-belt! Been seeing that recently. What are the rules on that?

Edit: I saw that H&M tag flash - love that they're not afraid to use cheap basics for what they're worth"
I never knew his last name was France. Tan France almost sounds like a drink.
"I feel like most of the ""after"" outfits look a little better but still don't really look good. Especially the outfit with the aviator jacket. It just looked kinda cheap."
"What shoes is TF wearing?Also, anybody can identify the blue jacket on the guy before the last one?"
All those pants were so tight.
As much as I love Tan's personality and personal style his fashion advice is just generally not that good. I can't help but cringe at a lot of the advice he gives on the Queer Eye show. For some guys it works really well but not every single male needs to be wearing a pattern short sleeve. utton up with rolled sleeves. 
That show is fantastic. The queer eye guys are such fantastic people and try to bring out the best in all the people they ‚Äúmakeover‚Äù.
Whats great about Tan is that he'll be talking to say a father of 5 and rather than taking him to the nearest SLP store and saying 'here wear some black on black and black and be super fashionable' he will instead take them to the local Target or something and show them just how they could maybe work with different colours and how to find clothes that fit. 
"I like Tan and Queer Eye but do not approve of the French tuck in every situation...seems
Overly trendy"
Tan uses H&M a lot whether in his show or in interviews like this one. He even wore a shirt I owned from them on one of the episodes once. He's certainly style over prestige which I love.
"Don't disagree, but that's Tan France for you. His whole thing on QE is makeovers that don't break your bank and aren't outlandishly different from what you were originally wearing"
"He's wearing some basic white leather sneakers, and the jacket is a harrington jacket."
Have you tried it? It feels appropriate with almost every look.
"I like that about him though - no one realistically would keep up the makeover if it was a drastic change - so I like the baby steps approach, I think people can actually keep doing them once the filming ends because it seems ""easy""."
"It just seems semi-sloppy to me...and a regular tuck seems more appropriate for like 90% of situations

I guess it just seems like a trend...and not something that will always make sense"
"I'm not going to debate about whether a half or full tuck is more appropriate. I'll just say that for almost all casual situations, a half tuck is an appropriate choice. "

I have a brand new all black pair in 46. I'm a 44. I need to flip them soon.
New up and coming Hedi-inspired boot that I‚Äôve heard about on this sub and GYW is called From the First. They only have Wyatts and zipper boots so far but they look pretty nice. Pricing is middle ground between SeF and SLP.
QC has apparently taken a bit of a hit recently but the main issues appear to be with their harness boots rather than the Chelseas. FWIW I did have a pair of their sidezips for a few years that have held up quite well

those are the ones that i have been eyeing for a long time.  I almost bought them but i have a pair of white leather vans that i will likely wear out first.  I have a fair number of casual shoes and should really put that money towards a pair of double monks to get another shoe in my dress shoe wardrobe.  I have also been eyeing a pair of 1k miles for the fall.  I wanted them last year and didnt pull the trigger.  I may do it this year.  
"Those looks nice! Similar to CQP which were also on my wishlist. Tried Axel Arigato but were too chunky, Common Projects have that special low silhuette. Veja Esplar is also great cheap alternative but I'm not sure those would last for more than one season."

Same. RM Williams have a jodhpur but they're not super comfortable on my feet.
Word? Could have sworn they started as Blake stitched and upped their game to GYW.
I‚Äôve heard nothing but great things about RM Williams! Really wish I could find a pair I was a big enough fan of to buy. 
"These are meant to be casual shirts, so the collar isn't particularly structured. Mine (from Kamakura) has held up well after several wears this season. I don't think it aged any differently from my other button ups."

"There is a chasm between good and bad graphic t-shirts, with all the artsy, pop-culture, 'funny' and all that kind of prints being in the majority and certainly on the wrong side of the spectrum, and more thoughtful, abstract, or simple designs being what would look good and work well with many styles and outfits. 

I personally love graphic t-shirts, but one of key milestones in development of my own fashion sense was to understand that they don't work with everything and should take up place of flavour pieces, rather than the backbone of your wardrobe. I had phased out about 80% of my graphic t-shirts out of my daily roations now and I feel better about my overall style for it. *I do still wear them to work though, either when I really feel like it, or when, in drastic circumstances, I run out of plain t-shirts*

A very good selection of shirts and outfits here, was an enjoyable scroll. Overall, it seems that two main approaches work best - either wearing it as a bottom layer with a simple layer on top (be it a shirt or a jacket), or wearing it as a statement piece in otherwise plain outfit. Either way, I can certainly get behind both of these approaches. "
The only graphic tees I wear are band (mostly metal) tees. Fucking love them.

Continuing trying to remain focused on more Spring/Summer focused items, lets talk Graphic Tees

**What is this album?**

This album was created from the Top of albums from each month from 2018 going back to ~2013. To clarify after last week's album this album was **not intended intended or curated to show a diverse range of outfits with graphic tees**. Just simply the popular ways in which graphic tees are worn here on MFA. 

*Slight disclaimer: In an attempt to broaden the album some of the outfits may have come from outside of Top of albums*

**How does MFA wear their graphic tees?**

Casually, sometimes layered over. The design of the graphic tees usually fall under arty or simple graphics while puns/mall tier graphics are avoided. See [here](https://redd.it/1fipqo) for more of a discussion. 

In this album the usually fall into outfits of greyscale, monochrome, or pale pallets. Worn with black jeans, light wash blue jeans, lighter trousers. Graphic tees and sneakers are completely common pairing. 

**But I thought MFA hates graphic tees?**

Back in 2016 Metcarfre had Graphic tees in his [SS16 Items to Consider](https://redd.it/4j6s3f) and this is what he had to say 

> ""Metcarfre, I'm pretty sure you insulted me for wearing a graphic tee just yesterday."" You're probably right! But graphic tees can be a great way to inject color, design, and fun in to summer fits where you don't have a lot to work with. Avoid reference tees, thkinkgeek, etc and focus on cool abstract designs and more art-influenced ones. Sources include Uniqlo, Acne, APC.

**Doesn't MFA recommend avoiding graphic tees?**

As a beginner friendly forum it is easiest to just have the blanket recommendation of switching from graphic tees to plain t-shirts.

From jdbee (2012)

> The standard advice on MFA is to avoid graphic tees because the vast majority of people on the street perceive them as juvenile and immature. If you're in high school - even college - then that's probably no problem, but beyond that age, you may want to aim for something more mature. If that seems unfair or too restrictive on your personal expression or whatever, take it up with society.

This brings up context. The outfits in this album are not layering a graphic tee with a suit, they are just out wearing graphic tees enjoying summer. 

**After a while these all start to look the same**

That is a completely fair point. As I said a lot of this is iterations of similar things. This album is derived from the Top of albums so this is more indicative of what MFA was wearing and what was liked. 

**""My favorite graphic tees inspo did not make it into the album""**

Please feel free on posting it below, not everything made it into the album or I just missed it. Show people what you like and how you like it. 

**That jacket or those shoes on the dude in picture X are dope, what are they?**

To quickly find out what an item of clothing is, try using Google image search. It will usually take you to the original listing and most posters will list the items worn and/or you can PM wearer and ask them to tell you what they are wearing.

**What are MFA's most common graphic tees?**

MFA favorite graphic tees seem to fall into 3 categories:

* Band tees

* Uniqlo graphic tees 

* Other (potentially consisting of designer labels including Undercover, APC, etc)

**Closing Notes**

If anyone would like me to remove them from the album just shoot me a message and I would be happy to do so. 

Also I avoided some graphic tee fits because they were already featured in the MFA Wearing Bomber Jackets and MFA Wearing Denim Jackets albums. 

If anyone has comments, criticisms, or ideas about how I should do the next ones feel free to let me know.

"I think to really get graphic tees right you kinda have to walk a fine line - they can fall into corny/lame/forced territory pretty easily if you don't know what you're doing.

Some of the coolest graphic tees will always be band tees. Obviously, don't be that guy who wears a band tee just because of the design (remember the whole Metallica tees fad back when Yeezus dropped? I don't think we need to revisit that).

Apart from that, a few of my favourites are from Undercover, Number (N)ine, Enfants Riches Deprimes (when they're not being overly edgy), a few Prada/Balenciaga ones, and a few select Hedi-era tees from his Dior and SLP days. 

Most of the brands mentioned above (except for Prada and Balenciaga), cater for this punk/rock aesthetic, which means that I could very easily wear these with my current wardrobe and not look like I'm trying too hard. "
/u/Tttigre where is that circle tee from?
graphic t's are dope but they're better when they're not just an artsy graphic on a T... that's a 2010's hipster trend. A 5k shirt with a cool design has more clout then some shirt with a random square on it

"I think the fit of the shirt matters way more than what is on the t-shirt itself. If you are a fit person, with a well fitting shirt, you could have literally anything on it and you would look good. Wear the shirt that matches your style, and your body shape."

"I love a simple graphic tee, but it‚Äôs so hard to find the ones with the images and text actually sewn into the shirt with the rest of the fabric. I don‚Äôt like feeling the difference, and sometimes the image and text can wash off."
Does anyone know a good brand with a lot of minimalistic graphic tees like these? 
Last shirt source please..
When did MFA become r/streetwear?? Hah just kidding. Nice album. I love doing the graphic tee look with band shirts. I go to a lot of music shows and grab one just about every time I go. 
"Wear skinny jeans and an unbuttoned shirt over top? Idk. I like this sub and you can downvote me to hell and back but this is lame ""advice"""
Do you guys really wear your pants like that?  It looks absolutely stupid.  
"Honestly, I only think graphic tees can be considered fashionable if they're tucked in or extremely exaggerated in some soft of Kanye West/Travis Scott/street style hybrid where you purposely wear a vintage/worn shirt is sized too big and paired with distressed pants and loud shoes.

Normal graphic tee wearing isn't anything worth writing about, it's about as far away from trying as possible.  It's when you elevate it (tucking into trousers, exaggerating proportions) when it becomes fashionable.

just my 2 cents"
"Great comment. I really like the take away

> Overall, it seems that two main approaches work best - either wearing it as a bottom layer with a simple layer on top (be it a shirt or a jacket), or wearing it as a statement piece in otherwise plain outfit."
Thank you for being way more articulate about this than I could be. 
"Artsy is on the wrong end of things? What separates artsy from the thoughtful, abstract and simple designs on the opposite, good end? Not trying to argue by the way, genuinely curious because I don't know anything about what a good graphic tee entails."
Do you have any examples or particular sites/stores you go to for them?
"Only problem is finding good fits. When I see Gildan Heavy Cotton I steer clear, but softstyle is fantastic."
"Same here. The only shirts I really wear are metal band shirts. I listen to a lot of grindcore, powerviolence and screamo/skramz so the graphic designs are usually a lot more clean (Unlike the death/black metal ones I have) which makes it fit my look better. The only problem is that I have a lot of black, especially during the summer. And the style isn't really well represented here. :("
"Lots of metal band shirts comments here‚Äîhoping some of you guys have answers. 

I‚Äôm less into repping actual bands but really like dark/black/faded tees that you often see *them** wearing. Stuff with sort of satanic/cryptic/occult designs.  Any recommendations on where to find similar tees? "
I plan to keep wearing my graphic band tees even in my 40s.
Same. Punk and Goth bands only.
"I have to about I stay away from metal graphics, they usually don't look good on the shirt to me.  Admittedly some metalcore bands have some good ones, what bands have good tees?"
"I complained about this elsewhere recently, but I just hate that all my band tees are largely black with a white band name and graphic. I get why bands default to that style --- it is the most inoffensive color scheme --- but it's also boring to style.

My favorite band tee though is from when I saw Pearl Jam in Philadelphia a few years back and they made special shirts for the city with the band name in the style of the LOVE statue."
"Has there been an ""MFA wears hats""?"
Such a good collection along with everything else
I knew I had to use it when you posted your recent pick-ups. 
What is underman? Is this a brand?
"Some of the worst t-shirts can also be band t-shirts. Namely the ones that are just an album cover in the center, even worse if it's literally CD album sized. Unique designs for band shirts can be great."
Or film! Lastexittonowhere has tshirts about movies but the designs are not obvious so only those who know the film know what it represents. I love band shirts that go beyond the album art. 
cdg shirt from 5 years ago!
/s? 
i see what you‚Äôre saying. my favorite graphic tees are from local shops and businesses i like. there‚Äôs definitely something about that i like more than a random design about something or another.

* Band tees

* Uniqlo graphic tees 

* Other (potentially consisting of designer labels including Undercover, APC, etc)

"I always thought people who wore that style as the same people who would wear jeans below their ass. 


But honestly, I have yet to see anyone wearing tucked in graphic t. Also, t-shirt from planeterium or musuem cool too. I like em alot. 


Just my 2 pence.

"
"Agreed. When wearing under another layer, I think it works because the upper layer visually frames it. I think #6 is the best example of this (guy in the stairwell).

I think something else that works well is a sole graphic on a white tee, but with contrast sleeves."
I thought your summary and tackling of the 'controversial' topic of graphic t-shirts was pretty great actually! 
"Good question! By artsy I meant those t-shirts that have art prints on them - i.e. [Society6 is a good example](https://society6.com/tshirts). While some there are still okay, majority are too much and not even intended to be printed on shirts."
"On lower ends of the budget, fast fashion places like Zara, H&M and Asos are good, but you need to be careful as they also produce a huge volume of complete drab. 

Mid-tier, AllSaints makes some decent ones, although some are too much too. Scandinavian style brands like Cos and Arket often have nice minimalistic graphics. JCrew and Banana Republic are also good places to check. Ted Baker if you are in UK/Europe is a good choice too. 

In higher tiers, Comme des Garcons and its various diffusion lines are a great place to start. Paul Smith/PS has some great examples every season and quality is good. I had a few from Boss diffusion lines and I see one or two I sorta like from time to time but they suffer from overbeanding a lot. Acne Studios is a natural upgrade from Cos and Arket in scandinavian zone. Kooples and Sandro are good for french SLP-style. 

Even higher still, I love Alexander McQueen t-shirts, Saint Laurent, Balenciaga, Burberry, Maison Margiela, Givenchy (careful with this one, some are too much print) among others make great pieces. 

Special shoutout should be made to band t-shirts, with one caveat is that you should listen to the band you are wearing. 

Edit: oh and of course can‚Äôt forget APC, AMI, Maison Kitsune, Undercover and Folk. "
"Browse the Uniqlo UT graphic tee collections, they're always updating them and might have something you like. The t-shirts fit a little boxy compared to their Supima tees but imo not a dealbreaker.

Edit: I personally liked the Max Bill and Karakami collections. The Hokusai might be interesting."
"I like and wear some of the abstract artsy shirts from Threadless but  the last batch of shirts I got from them were pretty low quality.  The seam at the shoulders were messed up and pointy and the graphic started to fade after two washes.  I really like the abstract stuff Threadless has to offer but if anyone has an alternative, I'd love to hear it."
"Absolutely. But when you have a badass Mammoth Grinder tee, everything just feels right, haha. "
And I'm a heavy set guy who loves the shit out of 2XL Gildan shirts because softstyle look shitty on me.  What a country!
"Dude, hell yeah! What have you been listening to lately? My girlfriend and I overwhelmingly wear mostly black and grey, haha. I too am bummed that the aesthetic isn't well-represented on MFA, but it's to be expected. I tend to balk at a lot of what is posted here, since it's often quite a bit preppier than I'd ever dress (I still haven't caved by buying an OCBD, haha).

The craziest show I've ever been to was a [powerviolence show with Hatred Surge and Mammoth Grinder](http://hardcoreshowflyers.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/01301111.jpg). It was literally in a tiny shack that somehow doubled as a boxing gym, and all the bands set up inside the ring. People moshed in the ring and were bouncing off the ropes. Fucking nuts. "
My area is a dead spot for skramz so I never get a chance for cool merch/bands for the most part. I really wanted that Screamo shirt that was a Supreme parody but it sold out super fast.
"Honestly, just get into metal and you won't have to dance around wearing shirts like that, haha. 

You don't wanna be a poser now, do you? ;)"
Same. Show those young rapscallions what's up. 
"Difficult to say. It depends on the artist responsible for the art on the tee. Good bands have dumb looking tees, and dumb bands have good looking tees. All a matter of personal taste. "
I loved the narrative and story telling that set the tone for the whole collection; not a lot of designers go that far to fully realise an entire universe for their clothes

Here's a few decent fits of them:

It's a nice style that's low-key-yet-elevated compared to generic casual/not-trying looks, making you stand out a bit compared to someone wearing a tee + jeans because you can do so much with tucked in shirts.  So many different types of trousers, shoes, accessories, etc... work with it.

The whole sagging pants thing really hasn't existed for the past few years, like here's a decent Kanye fit with an oversized shirt without falling into the sagging pants stereotype.

https://smhttp-ssl-33667.nexcesscdn.net/manual/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Kanye-West-T-shirt.jpg

Still has form fitting jeans, loud-yet-tasteful shoes, etc...

I personally wouldn't wear it but I don't think it should be compared to the old sagging True Religions + fresh white tees era."
"You're missing out on Helmut Lang, he's got some of the best graphics in the game, when he actually makes them that is..."
"Number (N)ine, Gar√ßons Infid√®les, Enfants Riches D√©prim√©s, Amiri and Gosha all have some good stuff too"
">Hokusai

I think this the best of the bunch uniqulo has to offer, although I may be biased as I have the great wave print hanging in my apartment. Anyway white tee with the flower decal on the pocket has gotten me more compliments than almost any other article of clothing I own."
"Yeah I like some of the Threadless designs, but the actual t-shirts they print them on are horrible quality and they only last a few washes.  At the price ($15 on sale), it‚Äôs still a bad deal but I actually do order a couple of them every once in a while, just with the knowledge that I‚Äôll get less than 10 wears out of them.

Cotton Bureau has been my go-to, their standard t-shirt is much better quality and they recently added a premium option. Some of their standard tees have lasted a few years without much fading. I actually don‚Äôt like most of their designs ‚Äî there are some truly awful pop culture and memey/political designs ‚Äî but they‚Äôre always adding new ones, and every once in a while they have a gem that‚Äôs subtle and abstract."
Upvote for Mammoth Grinder! And is your username a nod to Pig Destroyer?
"Really sucks that there isn't a bigger discussion on various styles, the meta here is really preppy, and I can't identify with it. I think that the hardcore/skramz scene in Sweden has some great fits. Just look (and definitely listen to!) at bands like Godmother, Prescriptiondeath, Kid Feral and Setsuko or just bands in the swedish straight edge scene and I find a style that looks really good but still allows people to rep the bands they love. I really like it. I came from the black/death metal scene as a young teenager, and while I still like to whip out my old Dismember/Carcass/Discharge shirts out now and then, it really can't come close to the ""clean, straight edge hardcore/skramz"" style I adhere to today.

Lately I've been listening to a lot of Deathspell Omega, Swedish screamo, various hip hop artists (MF Doom and Sjukstugan) and Icelandic black metal bands. Listening to Repugnant and Cloud Rat as we speak, heheh. Speaking of Hatred Surge, I have [their ""hands"" shirt](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0616/4577/products/hatred_surge_hands_1024x1024.jpg?v=1437337397) coming in the mail to use as a back patch for my black denim jacket (Long sleeve, I might post pics here when I'm done making it). I really love them, great band. That sounds like an amazing show, I really love small shows like that. Usurp Synapse had a similar gig in a boxing gym. I've yet to go to a boxing gym gig, the best I've been to so far have been Merzbow in a small abandoned factory, Sunn O))) at a smoke filled venue, Entombed (The OG Entobed, a reunion show) on a cruise ship and Setsuko in a small youth venue/anarchist caf√©. (The last show got me featured in Vice, moshing in a flowery shirt)"
That sounds like the most incredible show 
"That sucks, all my skramz merch is from local bands. Luckily we have shows often. Ordering bandmerch online is a pain due to shipping, but it's what I do for grindcore/powerviolence/hip hop shirts. I'm in some second hand groups though so that helps too."
"I am into metal, just not necessarily band shirts. I think it‚Äôs just words on shirts in general. I‚Äôd rather have symbols, etc."
"I think Underman might be my favorite men‚Äôs collection for this, and Grace is my favorite women‚Äôs."

"absolutely my dude, of course i remember you. always enjoy seeing you around /r/indieheads too (tho i don‚Äôt post there so regularly)"
"Your example does not reflect the statement you said earlier. That fast fashion t shirt that you linked does not have an artsy design on it, it had the brand name in a box in an extremely basic and uncreative design. A good example of artsy tees imo is the Uniqlo x SPRZNY collection. Those are literally art on t shirts and undoubtedly better looking than that marathon shirt you linked in my opinion."
"I agree big time. So does [Gosling](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-srujg-j60b4/UJ3Ztm4HL3I/AAAAAAAAAEg/RFD_nFuRIJo/s320/A7TKLtHCQAEoCkW.jpg).

"Maybe I've seen people wearing tucked graphic t-shirt but never register it. Still wouldn't wear it tho since I'm average that style look more appropriate to thin guys/girls.

The one wore by kanye not really that bad tbh. But I wouldn't wear just because baggy clothes is annoying to walk in. Unless you walk with your arms outwards.but anyway, when I think of baggy clothes, I think of that white dude who sing ""baby baby"".I saw his picture with white baggy shirt and sagging jeans. Maybe that's why I'm so negative of it."

"I'll have to check those bands out! I think I know what you mean regarding the ""cleaner"" aesthetic; I really dig that.

My former labmate actually had that Hatred Surge shirt, as well as a Pg. 99 shirt. The funny thing is that he never had time to listen to music (he's a machine in the lab), and upon meeting him, you'd *never* guess he was (at least at some point) into that scene.

I think the marathon shirt could work great in a *really* Americana/vintage/heritage vibe.

The other guy tttigre had a good point too, about the style of wearing shirts that you have a connection with.

Ideally, you want to start doing some freelance work while in your masters or whatever you plan to do after. Get experience, bolster your CV. 

Alternatively, can go into a graduate job somewhere cool like a fintech company or, if you are good, Facebook/Google/etc. Their schemes are usually pretty good as far as experience goes and they look great on your CV.

"python, SQL, java are all great and needed for data science and data engineering, so you are on the right track mostly. 

I would run a few personal projects to get familiar with the tooling and then sign up to some online communities where people post their problems and stuff that you can help write code to solve.

"I've always wanted a leather jacket, but I suffer from Asian baby face and don't know if I'll be able to pull one off. Last week I gave in and ordered one, so I would love some ideas on how to style it. 

I order a black moto style jacket, unfortunately they don't have a link for it, but it's quite similar to the one I've linked below. Except it has two chest pockets with black zippers.

I've also ordered three pairs of Chelsea boots (thanks /r/goodyearwelt for murdering my wallet). A black leather, a navy blue suede, and a grey suede. 

I will probably do a few achromatic looks, like light blue jeans, darker blue t shirt, the navy boots, with the jacket on top. As well as the obvious, all black outfits, and white t shirt, blue jeans outfit. 

If anyone has any suggestions outside of the simple basics, I'll be very appreciative!

Really cropped trousers are just shorts that are too long.
Let's fix this. Where have you been looking?
"I emphasize, I spent the last quarter of my life without jeans. I struggled soo much with finding jeans that I can actually get on past my thighs, let alone fit my waist.

I owned only chinos that were a size or two bigger than my turn size, because they actually fit. Now I have four pairs of jeans!! They are all various athletic fits, but look like skinny jeans.

I'm thinking of purchasing some of the more expensive denim, as they have some intense sizing guides. Try looking at some of the more expensive brands, they might have more fit options."
Get Naked and Famous Weird Guy
rag & bone fit 2 works nicely with my thicc calves. I've been running long distance for a loooong time so my legs are pretty large in general. these are my favorite jeans. I think they have a sale online rn too
a cheaper option you can try is A&F rustin fit. they worked really well with my thicc thighs
Acne slim fit is perfect I have big legs from working out and they look great.
"work out to get rid of baby face, only way"
"Maybe try some sunglasses that add to the look? Could add some depth or shape to your face to take away from the baby face. Other than that just rock the look, that style has a lot to do with confidence. "
"What brand of Chelsea boots?

And as for the leather jacket, stick with solid color t-shirts or Henley‚Äôs in white, blue, gray, or red or maybe some kind of ‚Äúvintage‚Äù graphic tee. A nice pair of sunglasses would work. You said you had a baby face so maybe try something with a square frame like some Wayfarers. In the winter, a nice scarf works really well. Any color but black should work. Scarves give you a lot of versatility with jackets because you can tuck it into your jacket, wear it over it, etc.

Also when you get your jacket, make sure it fits you like a glove. A baggy leather jacket only becomes baggier as it stretches over time."
I feel like leather jackets always look better on people with more volume to their body. I have a really slim build and always felt like something about leather jacket on a skinny person looks kinda awkward

Pretend you're a drug kingpin or Don Draper on vacation 
Same. I've got a pair of white Stans and find myself avoiding them because I feel like they're SO WHITE and DRAW ATTENTION and I have no idea what to really pair them with.
"Like /u/CazadorOscuro said, I think you can easily pair white trainers with a lot of things. I also used to hate wearing white sneakers because I thought it was too attention-drawing and stuff, but I've learned that people don't care and neither should I unless it's caring about how great the shoes pair with the rest of my outfit.

This is something that I've been trying to keep in my mind recently: the most important part of an outfit is being confident and owning the look."
"Can't pull off light jeans either, it just looks weird on me. I wear white sneakers pretty often, but most of the time they're the only pop of brightness on my outfits"
"I'm so glad, I thought I was the only one who felt silly in white sneakers. "
"do what i did. i went to a nice sunglasses boutique, like one of those places that are owned by someone who really really cares. anyway you find a sales person and you are like ""hey i have a weird head, i dont know what to wear. help please"". and they will."
Some people have larger heads. Its not something to ignore. One size does not fit all. Find a pair that fits.
"same, my nose is too big lol"
John Lennon had a beak for a nose and he made em famous. They might look all right on you. 
"Those look stupid on most people I feel like, including Lennon...he's just famous."
"I have arrived! Cravats are my day to day neckwear seeing as I live in Texas, but want to keep some modicum of formality to my dress (also they're like 8x faster to tie than a traditional The). The easiest way is solid colored shirt with a cravat (and a vest if it's your thing.... I'm a larger guy, so vests help bridge the upper/lower gap) tie it and forget it.

Simple patterns (dots, etc.) work best. Avoid the Paisley type patterns at first, as they can be quite a bit too busy. I find myself grabbing simple accent pieces far more often the see days.

Another key is having everything else be somewhat understated. If I'm wearing tassel loafers or an ivy cap, it can be a bit much. But chelsea boots with cut denim and a nice shirt? Perfect."

"Hmm... Cardigans have always been a staple in my closet. Have you tried different types, like thin, thick, long, short, cotton, wool, shawl collar, cable knit, etc? 

My favorite for work environment is a thin, slim fitting cotton cardigan that goes down just past my hip line."
"Whats your office attire, formal, business casual? Do you prefer thick or thin material? Horizontal or vertical pocket, I have a few ideas :)"
I think a well-enough fitting bomber can be a pretty understated and natural look with a regular pants+button down shirt with pretty unassuming sneakers (unless that's exactly the fboy that you're describing. My image of an fboy is a mega hypebeast dude).
That‚Äôs such a beautiful color. I‚Äôd pair it with darker earth tone jeans or chinos.

You may need to get the waist taken in. If you look in my closet you‚Äôll see sports jacket than span 40 to 44 depending on how aggressive the cut is, and pants that go from 33 to 36. "
"look for something that is lightly tapered. i also have M A S S I V E thighs, all my pants are lightly tapered."
try abercrombie fitch rustin
"Do you have super long legs or something? As a pretty normal-proportioned guy, I've always felt that tucking in improved my proportions because of the increased leg-to-torso ratio.

Not that you're not doing this, but I think an important aspect of tucking shirts in that can easily get ignored is blousing the shirt to create a sense of volume and weight. A shirt that's just tucked in and left super tight can sometimes make your torso look too small, making it look like your pants are eating you alive, whereas a well-bloused shirt keeps a good balance between your legs and your torso."
"If [this man](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/73/8a/25/738a25c26fde528418317c02f8748efd.jpg) can pull off chucks, your calves ain't nothin'."
"I feel like this is the kind of shirt that you have to go all-in for a streetwear look. I'm sure there are people who can pull together a pretty classic outfit with this shirt, but I'm not one of them :|

I think even a small misstep while putting this into a non-streetwear, MFA-uniform-ish outfit could throw you deep into that ""high school gamer kid who doesn't care about clothes and wears what he genuinely thinks is hilarious/cool because pop culture reference"" vibe"
What do you wear instead?
"What kind of fuzzy socks? Wool socks that are kinda thick, or the ones that are literally fuzzy looking and made for comfort?

The former, I think you can pull it off without looking weird. I think those work with high top shoes, like rugged looking boots with your pants rolled up to show the socks a little bit.

The latter, I do agree that it‚Äôs easy to end up looking like the weird kid :| but hey, try different looks!"
"In black, I think this is going to be pretty easy to match with other stuff. 

The first look that I thought of was a black skinny jean with a white shirt underneath, but you said you‚Äôre more of an athletic build. Maybe black shorts could work, although the textures probably needs a lot of attention."
"same stats and I wear A&F rustin, you might wanna give it a try"
"Same here! I feel like it accentuates my ears too much :| 

I‚Äôve found that beanies are a little easier to pull off though. Have you tried those?"
"Oh yeah I really like how those look too! I was thinking about wearing slim black jeans, white t-shirt, and a black track jacket with the yellow Onitsuka as the accent piece. I totally get you about not having confidence though. Owning the look can make or break an outfit no matter how natural/adventurous the look is."
"A&F rustin fit, I'm cutting now too and these fit like gloves"
"I'm 5'9 and they felt too short for me and were uncomfortable to wear so I sold them and bought something else with the money. 

Kinda regret selling them and I might look to buy another pair if I fancy them.
"
"Start with the shoulders, don't just tug at the crotch."
Honestly I don't really agree with this any more. It seems to be accepted wisdom on here but as long as you follow rules 1 and 2 I think it looks good. Although it's easy to make it look like a fedora for your torso if you've got the MLP vibe going.

Before though I kept going through the various Levi offerings and couldn't find any that I felt fit well enough.

I have a pair of Pacsun skinny black drawstring pants that aren't denim (no clue what they actually are) but they're the closest ""feeling"" thing I have to jeans and they fit pretty well.  Tight to the leg but not overly tight.  Has a little bit of bunching towards the bottom of my leg that goes really well with the drawstrings and zipper bottoms.

More so what I'm asking is just how to approach jeans.  Like, I don't want skin tight, but I ***definitely*** don't want to be a boot cut bandit.

">I'm thinking of purchasing some of the more expensive denim, as they have some intense sizing guides. Try looking at some of the more expensive brands, they might have more fit options.

I've heard nothing but amazing things with regards to purchasing expensive denim, but my problem is I'm not even sure if I would use them enough to warrant the purchase.  Like, if I went out and bought a pair of Rick Owens trousers, I know for a fact I'd wear them every single day if I could because it would work so well with my current style and wardrobe.  I couldn't say the same with expensive denim.

Jeans wouldn't be horribly out of place, but given everything about denim (mediocre feel, lack of airiness, etc) I'm not sure how often I would wear them.  Like why would I spend $100+ on a pair of pants that *might* would get worn 3 or 4 times in a month."

The jacket is a perfect fit. Every sizing element of it fits me perfectly, but the chest is a tad snug zipped up, which as you said will stretch out with time."

"That's the thing about white trainers, you can style them with anything you like. You can dress em up,dress em down. Whatever look you're going for.

"That such good advice. I think I‚Äôve been doing by intuition because otherwise I feel I‚Äôm wearing a circus tent. Tailoring helps, Ive just learned to do it in bigger sizes and for pants get the waist adjusted if I have to."
I definitely have more leg than torso and I feel like my height (5‚Äô9) doesn‚Äôt help with it. I also never know when to tuck or untuck. What do you wear tucked in?

Maybe look into American Eagle slim taper jeans. They fit have a nice taper and a bit they have some stretch to them so they are super comfortable.

"Probably best off just getting some straight leg jeans with some stretch, then taking them to a tailor. They can give them a taper that gives you a good look. "

Nudie jeans tbh (if you want loads of options)
Did you get pretty lean? I find it to be pretty rare for people to be down around 10% bf and not have a defined jaw or cheekbones. Generally once you get to below 12% you start losing a lot of fat in your face that you didn‚Äôt even know you had.
"Black leather, brown/tan suede. slim silhouette "

If you have a bit of a larger head, maybe try looking at some aviators? Just keep looking at various brands and sizes until you find something that fits. Check out Rayban‚Äôs 61mm [aviators](https://www.ray-ban.com/usa/mobile/sunglasses/RB3025%20UNISEX%20012-aviator%20classic-gold/805289114574?category_Id=908651)  or the slightly larger Maui Jim [Cook Pines](https://www.mauijim.com/US/en_US/shop/sunglasses/aviators/cook-pines).

Everything looks better when you're (reasonably) jacked 
As long as it fits the way you look that's all that matters. Dressing for your silhouette is always more important than the individual pieces themselves IMO
You like them yet you're posting about how they look bad on you. Protip..they look bad on most people because they are ugly in general. Don't forget to add a Fedora.
"Search Amazon for Hisdern or SetSense ascot and you can pick up a fun, flexible piece for $15 or so. 

Nicer all silk stuff obviously runs more, but most of my day to day pieces are sub $20."
So what you're saying is either way I need long ass hair
"Yeah some white slim-fit chinos, a floral print shirt and some grey chelseas would make a great fit with this imo"
"I just wear regular button-down shirts, usually a slim fit but sometimes regular fit if I want it to be a little more versatile (I'll explain later). A good rule of thumb for me is to tuck buttoned shirts when wearing chinos. I also almost always tuck shirts in if I'm wearing something over the shirt, like a cardigan, jacket, coat, etc. 

This summer, I've been doing a half-tuck or front-tuck for more casual looks where the shirt is the outermost layer. This is much better done with a regular-cut shirt than a slim-fit shirt. This is what I meant by ""versatile,"" where I can tuck, untuck, or partial-tuck. Slim shirts look kinda weird on me when partially tucked.

I actually got the idea to try partial tucks from women's fashion, and it seems like these partial tucks are kind of polarizing among men, so you might want to try it for yourself in front of a mirror and decide whether or not you like it."

Yeah the few times I‚Äôve tried the tucked in look I would try to layer things on top so it wouldn‚Äôt be so pronounced. I‚Äôve attempted flannels with a tucked in undershirt but I always feel I look like an old man haha. Does a belt enhance the styling?

This is fucking great. Thank you. 
"Great! The only pair of Nudies I have had which I didn't like were a Steady Eddie pair (they were a quite wide/straight fit which never looked quite right on me), otherwise they have been super durable pairs of jeans which lasted me years of wear per pair."
Yeah anything lower than that probably wouldn‚Äôt be too much fun or worth to get down to. Maybe just add accessories and mess around with different hair styles. Go all the way with the look.
"I feel your pain. I havent shaved since right about this week last year and all I have is a mustache, that little patch under your bottom lip, and hair under my chin, and just a few little hairs here and there along my cheeks/jawline. "

"I have the opposite problem. I just graduated highschool and I have toshave my face every 3-4 days, but even worse I have a thick crop of shoulder, neck, and torso hair. Idk man, kinda rough on the self confidence on beach days, but I'm getting over it I think. Just genetics, nothing I can do about it. "
"Depends a bit on the style you‚Äôre going for but for slim fits you want slim boots. I‚Äôve had good luck with meermin but the break in is a bitch. From the first has been getting good reviews, I‚Äôd avoid story et fall as they are notorious for being uncomfortable even though they look the part, common projects can probably be found in that budget as well. If you want to spend a bit more used Saint Laurent is probably the best option. "
"I shave the back and shoulders, trim everything else"
"Thanks, those Meermins looks amazing. I‚Äôve also heard mixed things about SeF which is a shame because I love the Wyatts style boots, but From the First is equally nice. Hopefully I can find more info on them because I haven‚Äôt heard anyone talk them except a few other people on reddit."
"Meermin is arguably the best pound for pound shoe maker available. If you‚Äôre in or around NYC they have a brick and mortar store but even with their pricey shipping costs the price to quality ratio is fantastic. But yeah from what I understand, story et fall‚Äôs problem is that they don‚Äôt design their lasts around the shoes having a heel and that causes a lot of discomfort. A few good reviews of from the first have been popping up here but I haven‚Äôt seen much else. Another suggestion is Beckett Simonon, I don‚Äôt know what their last shape is like but they also have a great price to quality ratio, based on many positive reviews. I have a pair of their sneakers on the way in September. That‚Äôs kinda the price you pay though, they keep costs lost by not holding inventory so you don‚Äôt receive your purchase until a few months later. Also meermin has an eBay store that sells seconds, might be worth keeping an eye on as well. "

Try them on before buying them? 
"How is wearing a watch overdoing it? Not every watch is a dress watch, there are tons of different watch styles that appeal to different styles. I feel like watches are a better accessory, as they have history and practicality. Bracelets just remind me of the 2000s pick up artist types, where as watches tend to be more understated and classic."
"A bracelet is a good way to add a bit of color or interest into a fit. This is especially true in the spring and summer because of shorter sleeves and less layering. As with anything, there are people who overdo it which makes phrases like ‚Äúwrist game‚Äù a thing. The ones you linked are very easy to wear and will work with many different styles. I personally wear a watch daily and usually add a simple waxed cotton bracelet on the other wrist (some prefer the bracelet and watch on the same wrist). If you‚Äôre looking for brand recommendations, Miansai and Caputo & Co are two that I like and you can find them on sale very often through stores like Mr Porter, East Dane, etc"
"I'm not so sure why you think a watch is overdoing it. Get a couple of cheap watches like a [Weekender](https://www.timex.com/browse/collections/additional-collections/weekender/) and a [Weekender Chrono](https://www.timex.com/weekender-chrono-40mm-nylon-strap-watch/Weekender-Chrono-40mm-Nylon-Strap-Watch.html?dwvar_Weekender-Chrono-40mm-Nylon-Strap-Watch_color=Silver-Tone-Green-Cream&cgid=men-chrono#sz=36&start=37) and then get some accompanying [Nato Bands](https://www.amazon.com/BARTON-Watch-Bands-Choice-Standard/dp/B019CXDZAM/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1531609915&sr=8-5&keywords=nato+bands) to change it up occasionally, and you're golden for any occasion. 

I normally wear a watch everyday, whether it's one of my Timex's, a smart watch, or my [Timepiece](https://shopna.eone-time.com/products/bradley-classic) (which gets remarks often), they all look good while not being too over the top, and they match well with casual outfits at the office.

I also wear bracelets daily and change it up occasionally but pretty much wear the same ones most of the time. "
"I feel things like bracelets should have a story or function behind them, or should be left behind. Let's be honest: most of those bracelets are BORING. There's no story behind them. They don't do anything. If you bought it online, it doesn't even have a cool story of how you got it. 


A watch does a lot of these things if done right; the function of telling time, with the added horological history, as well as the bonus of self expression and being eye catching. 


Unless you completely fall in love with a particular bracelet, or find one with a cool history or has sentimental value, I think that you should just think of bracelets as an accessory, as in a method to get across the message that you want. A sandalwood bead bracelet tells a different story than a studded bracelet. Your cheap silicone bracelets automatically give the impression of what your hobbies are. Make sure you use your accessories to tell a story. 


Just to give you an idea, I wear a watch almost everyday as an accessory. One of the watches I wear is a Seiko Alpinist, which is ornate enough to be worn in an office environment, but the brand was specifically created in the 60s with the mountain men of Japan in mind. I love it, and I think it suits me well; my occupation is as a manager near the Rocky Mountains. I wear my watch in the office during the week, then go hiking with it on the weekends. I use it to tell the time, time things, and use the bezel compass when I hike. I feel like I have a real connection with this accessory. I think THAT's what's important."
"The beaded bracelets you've linked are really, REALLY easy to make yourself (As [I've personally done](https://imgur.com/a/MEc28)), as is the leather one if you're willing to trudge around the net for a similar clasp."
"Bracelets are awesome, but I wouldn‚Äôt say that silicone bands are necessarily a good choice. They are fun and playful but I wouldn‚Äôt wear them outside of heavily streetwear or sporty outfits. I.e. for basketball as you said, all good; but I would leave them at home when going to work or out. 

Accessories are amazing in general and can really make the difference in an outfit.  Bracelets are my preference (aside from watches), so much so [I wrote a guide on them](https://reddit.app.link/vU8EEbGuzO). I wear mine on opposite hand from the watch. "
"I almost always have some kind of leather bracelet on, so I say go for it. "
"Ive worn a watch on one wrist and a bracelet on the other for years now. I have found the watch I love and will pass down to my first kid so I‚Äôve got that covered. It‚Äôs simple, water resistant, and although expensive, almost no one knows what it is so it flys well under the radar. I‚Äôve gone through many many bracelets such as the lokai ones, the super cheap thread ones and even toyed with the idea of getting an omega sailing bracelet for an obscene amount of money. In the end I actually ended up just making my own that I really love wearing. It‚Äôs simple, just bought a large fish hook pendant and some small ‚Äúrope‚Äù tied one end down and looped the other on the hook. It‚Äôs simple but means a lot more that I made it even though it‚Äôs cheap. I think for everyday wearing a watch is a perfectly fine option as long as it‚Äôs not huge on you, and a bracelet is a great addition to being an outfit together. Just my opinion though!!"
"I have skinny wrists so I wear them everyday, most are black and wood color because I can wear them with any outfit, they are not cheap where I live, but if I convert it to USD it becomes around $1 to $5. I checked all three bracelets your mentioned, I like them, kind of minimalist, not funky colors, not thick.  "
"(26M) I have kidney failure and I have fistula (for haemodialysis) in my left arm so I wear a rubber band/bracelet on that arm. The band has writing on it to instruct paramedics/nurses/doctors etc that my fistula arm should not be used for taking blood/administering drugs or for taking blood pressure. Doing so will break fistula which could be very dangerous. Say for example if I passed out and paramedics arrived then hopefully they will spot the band and use my right arm instead. I guess it really isn't a fashion accessory but I've had people ask me what a fistula is when they have perhaps read the band, so it is a nice little conversation starter."
"You can never go wrong when using accessories. While a watch is a great accessory to use when wearing a suit for example, this is just due to status quo, as it has seen done since the Victorian era with the pocket watches. 

Bracelets are a way for you to replace the dreaded ""what type of watch goes with this suit"", and I don't think that you would ever be wrong using one. Maybe stray away for bracelets that have a high content of copper, or leather in the summer as these may cause rashes due to the heat and sweating.  For example, for hot weather, the Fossil and H&M bracelets are good for summer looks while the Ted Baker one will bake your wrist, specially if it's a bit tight on your wrist. 

But the example you have given are for more casual settings and not formal events, if you need to go to one, in my opinion, all metal ones would suit more a suit ;)"
"Adding to what /u/care_crow said.
What is the reason, motif or theme to your style. Or why did you choose to dress differently?

I like techwear. I try to implement Paracord or neoprene to my watch leash. But I would almost never wear a bracelet without function on it's own.

Are you going for streetwear ish? Maybe be on the lookout for pop icon themed bands.

Hope I helped a bit with your inspiration."
">How is wearing a watch overdoing it? Not every watch is a dress watch, 

Besides, dress watches by design are made to be low key. I don't wear anything else besides that or field watch, even with a t-shirt and shorts. It's casual watches that tend to be louder. "
"Wonder what's this limit on bracelets and how to mix up L arm R arm.. I use to hate jewelry, but have come across good cheap watches at the thrifts which was a gateway to wearing shit on my wrists. This summer I ordered some bracelets from Todd Snyder, a red slim nylon stringed one and a  braided Il bisonte. That's a good point that in the summer it can add some color and extra bit to an outfit.

This ones a bit tricky to wear with a watch..

"That Timepiece is one of the sexiest things I‚Äôve ever seen. Just thought I‚Äôd mention that, carry on."
"Eh, wear what you want. People can experiment. It's cool to have something that ties with you(your example is great), but sometimes you want to wear something that you don't mind losing."
"Agree on the bracelet story thing. In general I think accessories having stories is a great thing, if someone comments on it you have a quick story to tell instead of just a general ‚Äúthanks.‚Äù

I wear a silicone light blue/white bracelet that says canine cancer on it every day, no matter what the occasion. It may not fit with a suit but to me it‚Äôs sentimental value is more important than appearing ever so slightly style-inept.

When my dog died about 7 years ago, all the members of my family got one. I wasn‚Äôt an accessories guy back then, or even into style at all, so I naturally wore it a few times and then kept it as a memento somewhere in my room. My dad grew up as a farmer with many dogs, but this dog was his first real close-bond house dog, and he loved him (we all did)! My dad wore his band every single day, no matter the occasion. As far as I‚Äôm aware he didn‚Äôt even take it off most nights (which I suppose you could see as gross, but I don‚Äôt mind it). Unfortunately, he passed away some months ago. I was riding up front in the ambulance to the hospital, and one of the EMTs handed me his bracelet, which I‚Äôm so glad about instead of cutting it off or something. Obviously it  is a very meaningful memento to me now. I save the original for special occasions (it is worn out and I don‚Äôt want to overuse it and have it snap) or for flights, as he was in aeronautics and loved planes. Now, I wear my original one every day, and it reminds me of values and lessons he taught me, and helps me feel close. 

Sorry this was a longer comment than I expected, but this is probably the most appropriate thread for this story I‚Äôll ever find, lol"

"A Nomos Club Neomatik, you can check my profile I just posted a picture on r/Watches"

"Oh that‚Äôs sweet, the first automatic watch I had was a Sinn 104, the black dial is fantastic!!"
"How‚Äôd you like your 104? I love German made stuff, because it usually lends itself to high quality."
"If it hadn‚Äôt been for the Nomos (which is German too) I would still have it and wear it every single day, it‚Äôs very functional, legible, and the quality easily surpasses the price mark "

Do you mean the back button on the collar? I think it was at one point used to keep ties in place but now it's more of a stylistic choice. I don't notice them when I wear it - how come it keeps you from wearing them? 
I only just got it during their recent summer sale so the picture here is the first and only time I've worn it. That being said - it was a hot day and it felt great! Way better than my other button downs. I don't think it's as breathable as linen but it definitely felt cooler and really did a good job wicking moisture - no sweat at all on a 90 degree+ day.

Nah the bottom front button that's black instead of white 
I did the same. Usually wear slim XL for the arm length. Had to go L but I always keep sleeves rolled up since their shorter
Happens to the best of us!
I think a small may work better...you wanna make sure it fits right on the shoulders and across the back.
"When shirts were still made by humans, this meant reinforcing the button and the buttonhole with a thicker thread, which was either done on a second sewing machine, or as a last step when finishing a job. Hence, the different thread and different color. This is still done even with machines, but it's a stylistic reason now"
"Oh my bad, I guess I'm not positive but I think that's just another stylistic choice to give it a bit of contrast? It's true of most of Taylor Stitch's shirts, not just their OCBDs. My short sleeves, flannels, and my California from them all have the contrasting bottom button. Only ones that don't seem to be the Moto and Utility shirts. "
"I hate to do it to you, but Men's Warehouse suits are generally not worth that price given their quality.  I would recommend you get your money back if you can and instead do a bit more research before spending that kind of money:

https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/8l0qqj/how_to_talk_about_suits/

https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/844jel/your_favorite_for_the_price_suits/



"
"It really depends on how the suits are altered when you get them. If they fit well off the rack and you don‚Äôt let out/take in the pants or jacket you‚Äôd generally be ok with up to a 15lbs shift either way since most dress pants have extra fabric inside and could be taken in if you lose weight. 
Once you start talking about more than 15 lbs it becomes harder to alter a suit to make it fit. 
As far as prices, that all depends on the suit and the person. 360 isn‚Äôt bad if it‚Äôs a decent suit and fits well. I‚Äôd say that‚Äôs on the lower end of what people typically pay for a decent suit. "
"You can always have them tailored again but generally the issues you might run into are:

* You had them tailored when you were slim and you gained weight or muscle which might make the suit tight in the waist, chest or thighs. You can have the jacket and trousers let out. 
* You had them tailored when you were heavier and you lost weight but didn't gain much muscle. In this case you might just have a bit loose jacket and it can be taken in or leave it as is. Loose trousers you can probably fix by tightening your belt but they can be taken in as well."
"Yeah the cost is about that price per suit. I have no idea, but if you‚Äôre trying to lose weight, you will generally be replacing fat with muscle, leading to being roughly the same size. Your weight range specifically probably won‚Äôt have a drastic enough effect to warrant getting a newly tailored suit. Though if you can, tailor your current suit a little on the tight side."
"In addition to what others have said, your body type matters. Some people gain and lose fat evenly distributed over their body, while other develop more or less of a gut; the former have a wider range of weight where their fitted clothing looks good than the latter."
"It's going to depend on your workout.  If you're just running/diet you might shrink down.  If you are weight training you may replace that with muscle and not lose any weight after 6months to a year.  It really depends.  Really you could look like a completely different person.  Also, you could become addicted to training and lose way more weight or gain way more muscle.  If weight training beware of shoulder/chest/thigh mass.  I hulked out of almost everything I owned until I dialed it back a bit."
"Well, the good news is that taking in a tailored suit won't be a problem.

And, losing that little an amount of weight shouldn't make too much of a difference (not accounting for body type, which has been mentioned).  If you are successful (good luck on it, by the way!), there should theoretically be no reason that you can't just have the pants and possibly the jacket taken in for a small fee and enjoy the suits for years to come."
"I lost about 60 pounds last year (part of what led to me lurking here is that I needed to buy an all-new wardrobe).  I made the mistake of buying a new suit around halfway through my weight loss, because I needed one for a wedding, and then proceeded to lose so much more weight that the suit was beyond tailoring after that one wear.

So as a general rule you should try to avoid buying a big ticket item like a nice suit or blazer if you‚Äôre trying to lose a lot of weight, or if you plan to start an intense workout regimen, because you can easily shrink or grow beyond the ability of a tailor to alter it.

I bought another suit about 85% of the way through my weight loss, because I thought I had stabilized, and then accidentally lost another 10 pounds. That suit was noticeably looser (although I didn‚Äôt look silly) but I was able to take it to my tailor to have it taken in at the back and waist for about $60.  A few pounds here and there is no big deal, but after around 20 pounds you‚Äôre looking at an expensive alteration that involves the shoulders of the jacket and awkward looking trouser pockets that are too close together.  I was quoted $250 to alter one of my old suits and at that point you‚Äôre better off buying a new suit that fits you right at SuitSupply."
"Holy shit, I'm also 188 trying to reach 175. I've lost and gained weight periodically for the past few years but my clothes have more or less stayed the same fit. I've never lost so much weight that nothing didn't look right, even for suits. 

On that note I would return the suits from MWH and get something cheaper while still stylish. If you're really determined to lose weight it's not worth it to have some items so expensive that you won't fit you properly in the long run. Especially if you get them tailored. 

If you want to go back to JCP, that's cool. But you can also check out Macy's/Dillard's, Nordstrom (rack), and even Express outlet has great deals on suits. In fact I got two suits there last time; Navy top and bottom for $150, and a light chambray gray top and bottom for $75. Got them both tailored for $170. That's $400 for a few years worth of uses between two suits. Even if I lose weight I'm not tripping off of $400 as oppose to the $900 you spent. "
Absolutely. Do not feel bad about the return. You can day way better at these price points.
"i disagree.  your proportions will be off for sure.  muscle doesnt come that quickly and your body will still be slimming regardless.    


For near 400 a suit, id say its too much there.  Suit Supply is about 400 a suit for their entry level.  "
"The thing is one is tailored and one is a ""custom"" suit so they don't do returns.

However I placed the order yesterday and and they won't be in for weeks so I don't know their return policy at this point"
"I‚Äôve always been of the philosophy that if you need fashion to be a part of your hiking experience then you‚Äôve got it all wrong. Fashion is for the city, not the backwoods. Get a nice pair of leather boots to go with your selvedge denim, and a rugged pair of clunky looking fabric hiking boots to go with your tilley hat."
"Fashion and hiking should not be mixed. Unless you're just walking a few miles at a local park. True hiking gear should be function driven. Looking good on the trails has 0 value over function. 

If you're getting into serious hiking you're starting in the wrong place. For 3000 you could buy most, if not all, of the top 95% pieces of clothing and gear and be significantly more prepared and equipped to handle what nature may throw at you."
"You're probably going to get a lot of redwing and viberg comments, but personally I like a good technical hiking boot like your second picture. Took my Lowa all over NZ and it fit like a sneaker and I could take them into the muck with no fear. 

If we are talking just aesthetics, I agree with your assessment. the major hiking brands make a simple style hiker that is closer to the Berluti one. Danner, Lowa, Asolo, Zamberlan. 

Check this out - https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-guide-to-style-conscious-hiking-boots-1445544446"
"Danner Mountain Lights and Diemmes are a good bet.

Both kind of old-school and heavy for modern hiking, but they‚Äôre certainly serviceable and look good in that style."
"Do you want to hike in these boots?

If not, Danner, Diemme, and Viberg have you covered. 

If yes, go to an outdoors store, try on a bunch of boots and trail runners without regard to how ugly they are. 

Don't try to find one pair to do everything. There's a reason why synthetic, lightweight footwear is popular for hiking--trying to cover a bunch of miles in heavy boots is tiring and unpleasant, and beautiful full-grain leather will get scuffed and scratched to hell after a few days on trails."
"[Outdoor Gear Lab](https://www.outdoorgearlab.com/topics/shoes-and-boots/best-hiking-boots)...if you want real hiking boots.

Otherwise if you are going for 80&#37; emphasis on looks and 20&#37; functionality for the occasional short hike, just get anything that suits your fancy. My cheap Reebok runners have served me well for short hikes lasting a few hours on steep, uneven terrain, even though they are not strictly hiking shoes and they look like crap. But they weigh almost nothing and are super comfortable. This means they are also easy to pack for any overseas trip. Can‚Äôt say the same for a leather hiking boot.

If it‚Äôs real hiking you‚Äôre after, water resistance, grip, comfort and lightness are key. And you want something hard wearing, and doesn‚Äôt take much looking after apart from a standard clean and airing out.

The issue is with what those dark Americana albums perpetuate. All those moody, good looking guys with well-manicured finger nails, perfectly shaved beards, wearing flannel shirts, flawless sweaters and raw denim might have people believe that leather hiking boots are the way to go. The reality is anything but. Lose the raw denim too. Flannel shirts? That‚Äôs the only ‚Äúmaybe‚Äù."
These [Fryes](https://www.6pm.com/p/frye-woodson-arctic-grip-redwood-smooth-full-grain-soft-vintage-leather/product/8932458/color/707985?zhlfid=139&kpid=42086685&ef_id=VcQh@wAABTZ-s2oK:20180715221122:s) are really great quality and look awesome.
"Danner Mountain is probably the split the difference piece. Scarpa also makes a really good all leather hiking boot.

All the people saying ""Oh man, your hiking boots HAVE to be super technical"" can miss me with that shit. I've done multi-week trips over hundreds of miles in all leather boots. Badass men who lived long before synthetic boots were a thing hiked the AT in leather boots and wool flannels carrying external frame packs. 

And I *like* looking good outdoors. The aesthetic is gonna change a little, my Tilley stays on the trail and my wingtips stay on the pavement, but just because you're outside is no excuse to wear, say, convertible pants if you're an adult. There's enough good looking outdoors gear out there that you can put together a cohesive outfit without dying."
I like my Feits.
"not only that, but whatever designer leather ""hiking"" boots you buy will fall apart ages before your moabs or Salomons. "
"absolutely agreed, if your first concern with any pair of hiking boots (or any other hiking gear/clothing) is how nice it looks, youre going to end up with problems. My hiking boots are god awful ugly, but they work well on the mountain.

 That isnt to say there arent some quality boots out there that can look nice with other outfits (Danner makes some quality boots that are aesthetically nice), but when youre picking a pair out go for fit and construction and assume that youll never wear them in a place where people care what your footwear looks like."
"If I may add.

I think that statement is more for hardcore hikers.

I only do light hiking (few hours maximum), and a pair of good quality fashion boots works out well. I have brown service boots (Wolverine) and they work.

I go hiking maybe once every 2 months."
"Man...if I had 3K to drop I could buy the La Sportiva mountaineering boots I've always wanted, a couple ice screws, another ice tool, and more technical gear. If only, lol. 

But yeah, seconded. Function over form always on the trail or backcountry. Depending on what level of intensity you're at that could make a massive difference in your comfort and safety."
"Zamberlan has some really nice leather hiking boots, will probably be my next boots though I don't see my Keen's dying any time soon. "
"Out of curiosity, why do you say danners are bad for hiking? I‚Äôve only heard good things about them."
"Yea definitely. Danner is a good example of fashionable & functional/durable hiking footwear, but at a massive & unnecessary cost.

Edit: spelling"
"Great boot, but for light hiking tennis shoes are infinitely more comfortable"
They‚Äôre pretty heavy for long hikes too. Beautiful boot nonetheless 
"Oh yes. Tennis shoes are much better. 

I just like to feel rugged. I almost never wear boots unless I‚Äôm doing manual labor or light hiking. "
"well it‚Äôs indigo chambray, so you can probably wear it with literally anything."
You could wear it with tan khakis or olive chinos. You could roll the sleeves up and wear it with shorts.

"Honestly? I like to wear pants cropped/no break, so I usually get my actual size 30x30, which is pretty commonly sold, and then hem it for $10-15. Most brands won't sell 30x28 and it's not enough of an issue to dissuade you from purchasing at common brands, just a bit more money."

I would anything below the wrist would be passable. Above that and it won‚Äôt be so great.
I have 19 inch shoulders and shirts and jackets with 18 inch shoulder dimensions often fit just fine. You'll probably be fine.
"It depends man on the other measurements, the shoulder size, the overall taper. It will certainly be slimmer but sometimes going a size smaller can make the size of the sleeves and shoulders smaller too so it can be too small."

I wouldn‚Äôt go for that. You can get a cotton double rider if you want something non leather.

"I wash my hair once a week and condition twice, just rinsing with cold water twice a day. Start styling with slightly damp towel-dried hair (or comb while blow-drying, but I don't blow dry) it's a blank slate as hair likes to stay in the position it dries in. 

I use classic oil based pomades so the oils act like a leave in conditioner (as was their original purpose). The buildup of product actually makes it easier to style day-to-day and I use less product. I use a heavy for the first two days and then a medium for the next four and a light on the last day, to keep the buildup in check and easier to wash on the last day. To wash, I put conditioner on dry hair and step in the shower and shampoo after a few minutes. It all comes out. "
"Dry shampoo is a can of miracles. It will absorb the greasiness, and give that hair some volume and life. You'll be able to rework your wax from yesterday and get a nice messy hair look."
"I mean, it depends on the person, but you can give washing without using shampoo a go. Get in the shower and rinse your hair thoroughly, that wouldn't damage it. However, the extent to which it works varies from person to person."
Rinse it out usually. If I'm feeling extra lazy I sometimes leave it in amd just brush/comb it when I get up and it hasn't let me down. 
"Buying a decent wax is a good starting point, and dry shampoo, as mentioned below."
"In general yes, they‚Äôll fit the same. Levi‚Äôs quality control can vary at times though and I‚Äôve found sometimes their online stock can vary especially. I just would be careful if something is final sale but in general yes you can use what you try at the mall as a guide"

"Give more room in the toes and the heel rub will disappear when broken in. 

Rule of thumb is to line up the widest part of your foot (flex point) with the widest part of the shoe. Most people tend to wear their shoes too tight, especially with sneakers because of the softer materials used, compared to 'traditional' leather footwear."

"I'm not your body type, but I also didn't like the loose fit of the Uniqlo Supima T-shirt. I ended up going with the J. Crew Broken-In T-shirt. The cotton is very soft (similar to supima) and with the current sale and discount code it comes out to $9. They also come in slim (which isn't that slim tbh).

You can also find tighter stuff for similar price at H&M of course but it sounds like you're looking for better quality."
They‚Äôre Ok. Not huge on the stripes or the weird branding - they look like knockoff Adidas even though they‚Äôre legit lol.
Sneakers do not go with dress shirts. I‚Äôd also not wear a dress shirt with jeans.

it's more about the combo than the short itself. Usually people don't recommend hi tops and shorts. I thought it looked nice on this photo.

"Oh, of course. I‚Äôm planning on wearing them with chinos or wool trousers, and a shirt. "
"My concern with the style was because of the slightly elongated shape, instead of a more round tip. "
"What do you mean by that? If there is harm, is it very minimal?"
Thanks for the response. I was also worried that if I would get 27.5 they would stretch over time and become loose. 
Maybe it's navy... Can't tell at all lol
"Thanks. I'll be ordering the shoes online so I don't know if it will be ""dead on"" match but from the photos I think it could be extremely close. I once saw an older guy on the subway, wearing a light gray suit and tan shoes, belt and tan leather bag. It just gave the impression of ""trying too hard""."
"Thanks for the tip. So if I wear 42 Chuck 70s, I should pick up 41 Achilles Low? "
Thanks a lot.
Thanks. How do I find out my undertones?
I didn't think about matching the tie thank you! 
What would you wear with a dress shirt then?
"I personally don't like loafers and oxfords or derbies seem too formal. 

Could you recommend me some minimal sneakers and should I go with black or white?"
"Yea, I don't usually dress nice (I kinda suck at it) and wanted to surprise her by being very dapper that day. I was even considering a short sleeve button up and a sport coat but am not sure"
Then you should be good my man!
"[something like this](https://goo.gl/images/9Em5UA). I have one without all the metal detailing I got in a tiny store in Paris so can‚Äôt find it now, but it is great for warmer weather when I want the aesthetic but don‚Äôt want to wear my leather one. 

Wool is good but it‚Äôs warm. I have a grey wool harrington I like a lot. I think the collared style fits wool better. "
Yes but not all cotton is denim. 
"That way the outfit will be a big more balanced with the boots that are not true-black. 

Sidebar of this sub is great source of info for starting out, including colour matching I believe"
"Really? The way I've always seen it is that shampoo cleans the scale and dry shampoo absorbs excess oil in the hair. The damage from shampoo is over drying your scale, but the dry shampoo isn't gonna go that deep.

Would you be able to explain that a bit more?"
"Basically. Shirts are often woven and don't stretch out much.

Knits like sweaters or cardigans however will stretch out more compared."
"You are in no way harming your shirts by rolling your sleeves. 

Well I guess they'll be wrinkled after being unrolled, but that's just a temporary ailment."
"Shoes tend to stretch slightly widthwise depending on well the leather or fabric. Out of leather suede tends to stretch a little bit more than calf and is more forgiving.

But depending how the sole is connected to the upper there won't be much give or stretch, i.e. sneakers with cupsoles.

What shoe don't do is stretch lengthwise normally through wear and tear. You'd have to go to a cobbler to literally get them stretched on a machine.

Often the heel counter (the part of a shoe that cups the back of your heel) is reinforced with another strip of leather like suede. 
"
"Ah I see. Sorry, it seems i asked a bit of a simpleton question. Thanks for your answer though!"
Yes
"Chucks run big too though, so I'd go with that size. "
"Couple ways to do it: look at the color of your veins that show through your forearm. If more blue: cool. If more green: warm. If can't tell: neutral.

Another method is putting on a purple shirt vs an orange shirt. If the orange clashes with your undertone: cool. If the purple clashes: warm. If both look ok: neutral."
Thats the first thing to think of actually. That or pocket square. 
I've never been fond of matching the date's dress but a good stealth option could be a pocket square. 
"White would go with more things, although for these outfits I would go for black personally.

Depends on budget. You could go with white Stan Smiths as a budget option, although something more streamlined like Svenssons or Common Projects is of course more preferred in this case."
"decent

yeah the idea is to get sth i can wear in fall and winter too 

tbh i‚Äôm a bit all over the place. im at transition point and my wardrobe is almost empty, save for socks and underwear and im trying to move in more of a rock chic direction. and im getting analysis paralysis, not sure what to buy

need a nice dark grey overcoat but want one with 2 buttons or just 1. don‚Äôt like the look of 3 buttons for some reason. and then idk wtf to get. do i want a bomber, a denim jacket or a harrington? I‚Äôm just so overwhelmed and i figure I‚Äôll just go into all saints and topman and let the sales guide me?? "
"Ah ok, didn't know dry shampoo doesn't go all the way down, so that is true. However, both have the function of stripping oils away, and too much of that will make your body produce excess oil to compensate, so you still end up with oily hair... whatever, up to you..."
Perfect!
"Would you suggest that in any case, black, grey (any nuance) and navy would work with all of them?"
Yeah I'm thinking maybe a sky blue suit with tie and square to complement the dress 
"I'd preferably stay below 100‚Ç¨.

I wear a grey jeans with a dark grey or royal blue shirt. With the grey jeans I'd wear the xplrs. Should I go with black or white shoes if I pick navy, black or lighter grey pants?"
"Don‚Äôt buy without a plan. Makes for a bunch of bad decisions. Check the sidebar and search the sub for SLP style inspiration. 

A bomber may work best for this purpose, or a teddy jacket even better. "
"I think Navy is a good color, but not every shade of grey. There are cool greys and warm greys. I wear black but personally avoid black shirts"
Either way would be fine but with lighter grey white is better. 
"I do have a bit of a plan

Got a corduroy trucker in beige, bunch of shirts and Ts, black suede derbies, black jeans, nice rings and 2 chinos. Need black Chelseas, burgundy or green blazer ([goat](http://image.ibb.co/giWxY6/fit_27_10_17_v1_stand.jpg) for me) or dark grey with detail on lapel, dark grey trousers, one light wash and another pair of ripped black jeans. Chucks or vans if I‚Äôve done money leftover.

It‚Äôs just the coats and jackets that I‚Äôm overwhelmed with. I‚Äôd love a dark grey overcoat with little white flecks/spots on it and two buttons but they‚Äôre hard to come by. Camel looks nice but a bit played out. Navy and plain black don‚Äôt have the ‚Äúedge‚Äù I‚Äôm looking for I feel, unless there‚Äôs some extra ‚Äúdetailing‚Äù on them. Shearling would be great but idk what brands sell them for max 200 euros. So I‚Äôm hoping all saints has sales when I go to London/Amsterdam next month. Kooples/Sandro and the like are outta my budget, even on sale 

Thinking a light wash trucker (would prefer washed black here but this could get some use in the summer too, unlike a black one) and a dark bomber would be good if I could get both for max 50 euros each. 

[Here‚Äôs](https://imgur.com/a/1ppXr9N) my ‚Äúbest of‚Äù album, after looking through loads of the ones I found here. About 70 pics, after looking through a good 1500 :o "
"If I get chinos some day, will plain white or black sneakers like the Stan Smiths also work or is something else better then? Are there other budget options apart from the Stan Smith?"
"They will be totally fine with chinos. Sneakers can always go more casual. 

Adidas GATs may be another option. Both puma and nike have clean white sneakers options but they are usually busier than Stans. You can check out COS or Arket for sneakers, they do minimalistic sneakers. Although I forget how much they are. "
"U think ill get black ones. Pumas fit me a bit better than adidas, so I might go puma. I also don't really like the holes on the stans. 

Should I go leather or canvas as material?"
Leather
Are there any completely plain sneakers like the svenssons but cheaper?
"Good ones - not really. Okay-ish, I guess COS sells some. Or you can try Ebay/Grailed/Thrift"
"Thanks, I'll take a look. Any thoughts on the all black puma smash leather sneakers?"
Yeah I would go for those or Court Stars
I would wear a full tuxedo just to be an asshole.
"If you're not in a sales position, or otherwise outward facing job, literally anything should be fine. But to play it safe, just wear a button up shirt with dark jeans. You're working in a engineering position though, so really, showing up in clean clothes and wearing deodorant is an automatic win."
"I've worked in the tech sector for quite a while now, and have always based what I believe ""smart casual"" to be at a company based on what the sloppiest dressed employee is wearing. If they rock that every day at work, and If you're more put together than them, you're good."
"i've been an SWE at a well-known tech company in NYC for a few years now. we have a 'smart casual' dress code, open office layout, yada yada. 

""smart casual"" is intentionally ambiguous, but can basically be boiled down to ""don't look like a shlump"".

put on some clothes you want to wear to work. ask yourself: would you be okay wearing these clothes in a serious meeting with your boss? boss's boss? CTO? business manager, who is probably dressed in slacks and his favorite charles tyrwhitt shirt and a patagucci vest? 

most days I wear CPs or MMM gats, chinos or tapered jeans, and an ocbd. the basic bastard, more or less.

dress how you want to be perceived. 

some hard and fast rules that i go by: no ""out there"" fits (think full rick), nothing dirty or with stains, no shorts, no graphic t-shirts."
"I work at a tech company in southern California, and most people wear tshirts, jeans, and sneakers"
"I hate ""smart casual"" as casual is relative to the environment.  So basically just a step up from what everyone else casually wears.  What do the co-workers wear in the new department?  Shouldn't be hard to figure it out from there.  I work in IT as well.  99% dress like complete slobs unless they are in sales.  We had to start a dress code saying no sweat pants no sandals no ripped jeans because that's what people would wear if you let them.  

I manage a remote support team.  Most wear polos and jeans.  I'm a total tool so I mix in chinos, dress slacks, button down, tie, blazers dress shoes.  "
"Dark indigo or black jeans, leather sneakers, and untucked button down (this is your staple). Cardigan and t-shirt can also substitute for the button down (should not be most days though). No polos. Mix in casual chinos and tasteful jackets (Patagonia nano puff, Patagonia better sweater, harrington, etc) as you see fit. On days you‚Äôre meeting with high-ups (director or higher), tuck in your button down and wear some nicer shoes that match your belt. "
"That seems good enough, but you may be interested in some long sleeved henleys as well."
Closed toe shoes
"I work as an HR Assistant and we have a Smart Casual dress code. The rules we go by are a collar, no jeans, no shorts, and no running shoes. Most people wear polos, chinos, and a casual shoe (I wear SeaVee Bajas)."
I'm confused about what you're asking here. Did you  start a new job with a smart-casual dress code? Or do you want to dress more smart-casual just because?
"Not sure why you‚Äôre asking here, but as a comment: your outfit, in now way, would be considered smart casual. In fact it‚Äôs about as casual you can get without putting shorts on."
Charles Minor would not approve
We're here to fuck shit up!
"I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs not a tech company... jeans are pretty much a requirement at the firms OP listed. 

Edit: and polos are never worn "
"I am moving team, same company, just wanted to be sure I wasn't dressing incorrectly as I never really gave this much thought before. "
But what if I could make a rundown?
someone/HR would have dropped some hints by now if you were dressing innapropriately.
What kinds of things do your new co-workers wear?
Depends on what kind of rundown you‚Äôre looking for. Do you have an example you could show me?

Thank you!
Sorry no idea. I know they're stocked by NoManWalksAlone in the US (?). As a Brit I dunno. I'd ask in the Simple Questions thread.
"I don't know that I have a definitive answer. People on MFA (and other fashion forums) have a persistent need to be overly specific with how they label a certain style, and it ends up being extremely similar to other styles.

MFAcore was randomly defined by another user, OP of this post simply copied that label and the album for this compilation post. However, it seems to be largely based around the Basic Bastard wardrobe. Basic Bastard is called-so because it's a capsule wardrobe of safe go-to outfits. MFAcore appears to be a little more casual than business casual. A lot of button-downs and well-fitting sweaters.

Streetwear, as defined by /r/streetwear:
>Streetwear is a distinctive style of street fashion. Rooted in Californian surf and skate culture, it has grown to encompass elements of hip hop fashion, Japanese street fashion, and modern haute couture fashion.

You'll find a lot more athletic-based brands like Nike, Adidas, Puma, Reebok. Tops tend to drape a little more, bottoms are either super skinny or w i d e. You'll see more hoodies, bright/vibrant colors. This style is VERY casual.

Japanese is heavily based around American workwear (stuff worn by rail and construction workers), but the fits aren't practical for handy labor at all. I recommend reading [Ametora](https://www.amazon.com/Ametora-Japan-Saved-American-Style/dp/0465059732) for the history of it. You'll see a LOT of denim and chambray. New Balance is a very prominent footwear brand. 

Overall, a given style isn't defined by specific items, but rather by the interplay of the items. You'll toe around many different styles. It's a fair question to wonder how certain style labels are defined, but I'm sure by looking at the individual albums you can see trends."

"Japanese styles are much much more than just re-interpretations of Americana/workwear.

They have a massive variety of styles, see /r/japanesestreetwear for example. Also mori boy, minimalist stuff, too. "
You too!
"You should own like 5-7 pairs of shoes that you rotate depending on occasion/activity.  If you wear one pair of shoes every day in every situation, you won‚Äôt be able to dress them up when you need to because they‚Äôll be too worn down. Biking is particularly damaging to nice shoes. I keep a collection of dress shoes under my desk at work and wear cheap canvas sneakers for my biking commute.

I‚Äôd recommend one or two pairs of derbys as an all-purpose non-active shoe, and the cheapest shoes you can find for biking, never mixing the two.  Put your derbys in a backpack if you‚Äôre biking to a social/work function."
"I would just go for a leather sneaker with a soft sole like crepe or a soft rubber.
I'm not sure there's a shoe that's formal enough for smart casual, but has a chunky sole and works with shorts. You could try a lug-sole derby shoe, but I can't say that's really the best shoe if you only want one pair."
"If you aren't fully constrained to dress shoes I'd recommend a leather sneaker like [these](https://svenssonshop.com/product-category/shoes/) from Svensson (I'd go for low-top white leather or army trainers); they're amazing for versatility, comfort and durability. They'd work with every option you've listed, but may require a little bit of styling in the case of the shirt w/ dark chinos. Imo there aren't many shoes that are much more formal but still wearable with the choices given, apart from suede chukkas which you've already said you don't like.

Edit: I remembered a few Tod's styles that also might work. [These leather loafers](http://store.tods.com/Tods/EU_EN/City-Gommino-Mocassins-in-Leather/p/XXM0LR0Q700ORTB999) from Tod's or [these suede loafers ](http://store.tods.com/Tods/EU_EN/Loafers-in-Suede/p/XXM11A00010RE0C405) could be decent options. Other examples: [these leather drivers](http://store.tods.com/Tods/EU_EN/Gommino-Driving-Shoes-in-Leather/p/XXM0GW0W510D9CS801), [these moccasins](http://store.tods.com/Tods/EU_EN/Mocassins-in-Suede/p/XXM44A00640RE0U805) and even [these sneakers](http://store.tods.com/Tods/EU_EN/Sneakers-in-Leather/p/XXM56A0V430RDIS818) \- although the sneakers are pushing it.

(picked sale options as full price would presumably be too much)"
Suede loafers?
"If you can afford it Bill Blass , leather loafers. I find that they work with slacks and jeans. And they are the most comfortable durable shoes I have ever had."
NMD cs2 suede
Seriously WTF. Do not go down the I'm going to wear one shoe for everything road.
"> You should own like 5-7 pairs of shoes that you rotate depending on occasion/activity. 

Ssh, you'll spook him.

Seriously though, you should have at least two pairs of shoes. Leather and canvas need time to breathe so they can dry out from all of the sweat from your feet. Occasionally you run into a tough as nails pair that last for years without needing any care like your dockers, but those tend to trade off not being versatile appearance wise (and not so good looking, but that's just my opinion). 

So I'd get a pair for biking (if your dockers are still good, keep those), and a couple of more dressy pairs. Since your style isn't super formal, black derbies like u/eg1219 suggested will do, maybe a more casual chunky pair like docs - they're in fashion right now, but they're generic enough that they'll never be out of fashion. There were [a couple](https://www.reddit.com/comments/8siq6x) [of threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/8xbnnu/if_you_like_white_sneakers_you_might_like_black/) on this recently. For your second pair mfa faves like desert boots or white leather sneakers are good, something lighter than your derbies so you can build light and dark outfits easily.

If you want to take an interest in fashion then start expanding your collection as you go. Get black oxfords if you've got a job interview or funeral coming up. Get heritage workboots or hikers if you walk a lot (or just wanna look hard as nails).   Get more sneakers or casual shoes if you want to up your casual game etc etc. If you don't, two pairs plus whatever you need for specialised needs will do."
"I think the [""hook""](https://www.shipton.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/p/-/p-wilt-tob-1500_2.jpg) the heel makes (under the arch of the foot) is particularly important to lock feet the feet preventing them from slipping off the pedal, especially forward.

Now there are shoes with distinct heels, but the ball of the foot is completely flat. Also I don't like suede loafers one bit, esthetically."
These are trainers... not loafers. Did you respond to the wrong comment 
You're right I commented kind of on two comments at once.
"I'm often in a similar situation- work in engineering for a manufacturing company that occasionally has me out in the shop taking measurements and doing sketches. I think you get the look pretty solid there. Definitely a notch above manual laborer but not officefool. Don't worry about the belt and boots, they look great."

"Colors are good, and they'll look especially nice going into fall!

Two things that stand out especially; you might consider finding a belt that's a closer color match to your shoes, and certainly don't button your collar button unless you're wearing a tie. 

The pants could stand to be about an inch longer in the inseam, (should cover where your shoes meet your socks with some room to spare) but they're not offensively short.

Pressing the shirt would be a good idea too!"
Definitely the gray or olive.

"Hopefully I am not the only person to reply to this because I am not an authority. Shoulders and sleeves look good to me. Cannot really comment on the body because you are a different fit to me and I don't wear tuxs. It looks like there might be a bit too much fabric somewhere but I cannot figure it out.

"The collar looks odd, maybe the shirt is just slouching down. Your dress shirt should stick out around half an inch "
"I'm no tailor, but I think the ripples in the sleeve look like they stem from another of the issues you identified: extra fabric draping oddly in the back. 

My personal take, not related to the suit: you've got a fairly slender face and might be better suited by a narrower collar and a half-Windsor knot."
"Rather than too small I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs almost too big!
Perhaps something with shorter sleeves would work better and maybe ditch the logo/print."
Awesome! Thanks.
How would you style the sleeves? Full down. Shirt sleeves down but top sleeves pulled up? Etc

"That looks like a pretty sick brand, wonder why they are so under the radar"
"It's hard to gauge the quality of TS's stuff anymore since they moved production to China. They are still pretty adamant that their quality has remained the same but reviews and impressions on Reddit and StyleForum say otherwise. 

I personally avoid their stuff made in China for this exact reason but if you think that this sweater is worth $200 then I say go for it. I am a fan of the elbow patches and the texture of the sweater, but I would look into the mill that they sourced their fabric from for this one. "
Elbow patches on cashmere seems weird. At any rate I can attest that TS quality is meh and their CS is terrible. Not worth the price tag imo.
"Eh, not really feelin' the elbow patches. Seems like too much contrast to me."
"I know you didn't ask about the price, but it just seems like too much for a sweatshirt. You can get god tier sweatshirts from places like Norse Projects for less than 150."
"Their customer service is the best I've ever seen, so I definitely disagree with you there. They've bent over backwards for me over a dozen times now. I think I agree with you on the elbow patches, but I've never seen a company with better customer service. "
I'm happy to hear you've had a good experience with them. Not really going to go into it here but they went far out of their way to make sure I never do business with them. Maybe the CS associate was having a bad day or something. 
"Yep!  I actually know of a few teams working on something similar in various companies.

The problem is that machines lack influence and hype generation as well as societal context which gives really really high end clothing a lot of their punch (Denma's kitsch for example can't be dreamed up very easily or marketed without some genius, but its super easy to replicate).  A machine might be able to replicate and augment someone's design process, but it isn't very easily able to generate the kind of sustained innovation and profit luxury brands require.  The feature space is also so god damn large, the uncertainty so great and the commensurate profit margins so thin that I really can't imagine a startup coming along and deciding to take on high end fashion, as opposed to targeting low to midtier retail customers from Walmart to UNIQLO.

In other words, I totally expect Bombfell et al. to be replaced by styling machines that will churn out looks (some interesting, some not), but the high end hobby stuff is a very different market.  Also, the technology behind the Generative Adversial Network and image filtration just isn't good enough to do something that great without having a Google or Facebook-scale warehouse computer dedicated to crunching numbers for a good period of time.  

That being said, I totally expect this to become a hallmark design strategy of some tech guy turned fashion designer in the next few years."
"I get such a kick from these kind of articles and advancements. Very interesting read with some off-field examples that one wouldn‚Äôt necessary hear about normally. 

I can imagine that for fast fashion that imitates luxury fashion and follows hype, you can replace most of design process with AI. 

Let‚Äôs take Zara for example, although it could be any other similar company (H&M, Mango, etc.). Web monitoring tools are not a new thing and they have complex APIs that allow to automate pulls of data they collect. You can set up a process that pulls all social and article traffic from the fashion side of the internet (Insta, High Snobiety, brand websites, etc etc) and monitor what styles get most attention and then scan them and pass the info to the next set of AIs that redesign them into a high street version. You can feed in material preferences, cost caps and other preferences and let machines decide optimal solutions. With a set of simple rules on ‚Äúvariation level‚Äù this will also resolve a lot of copyright issues these companies face, as you can guarantee that AI designs are different enough. 

This way you can start producing items hours after a fashion show with a high certainty they will be popular. "
"This is pretty cool. I can see so many applications of this, particularly when you start influencing social media with design cues as well. "

"Model is 6'2, 180 and wears a medium. "
"Is ""fits massive thighs"" a clothing measurement?"
"I think people use them as rules of thumb, because they're convenient. Of course not everyone who's 175cm, 60kg has the same arm/leg/chest proportions. But people usually know their height and weight, so it's a rough guide for them.

Not too many people have the patience to use a measuring tape to actually measure their clothes."
"Female subscriber here... is there typically a reason why in this sub for example, people don‚Äôt use measurements as often as a sub like r/femalefashionadvice?

I subscribe to this subreddit because the aesthetics of the posts here appeal to me, but I‚Äôve noticed that providing a chest/waist/hip/thigh measurement when asking for advice is quite rare, when it‚Äôs far more common in a woman-centric sub on the same topic (asking for fashion advice).

Is this a thing because men‚Äôs clothing doesn‚Äôt provide as many measurements? Is there less need for it?"
"It can actually be easier for me to buy a casual shirt off eBay than a manufacturer's website, because sellers on eBay can provide length and pit-to-pit measurements.  "
"This is especially dumb for talking about a brand like Uniqlo, a company that actually lists the product measurements for their clothes in each size.

If you care enough about how your clothes fit to frequent a subreddit like this, you should care enough to know your own measurements and/or your best fitting items' measurements to be able to compare them with a brand's provided measurements of a product."
"To second this point, I don‚Äôt carry weight like most guys. I‚Äôm 6‚Äô0 185, but carry almost all of my weight below my waist. I fit in medium sized tops, but bottoms that are on the large side, which, I don‚Äôt think, is very normal "
"Despite you are right about this and height and weight are inaccurate, I think it's a great way to have a basic mindset of one's frame and sorts. 

And more than often that certain individuals will point out if they have specific body characteristics like long arms, big belly, or massive thigh."
">I've heard tall people tell me that a small Uniqlo tee is too long on them, but small is perfect for my short self.

Right, and if someone on mfa posts their height and that a certain size shirt is too long/short on them, i can get a slightly better guess as to whether or not the shirt will be too long/short on me. Poster is 6'0"" and the shirts too long? I'm 5'7"", it'll be too long for me too. What if someone taller than average says a shirt is too short on them but doesn't list their height? 

Obviously the standard measurements (along with overall length of the shirt) are very helpful and important, but whats wrong with including height & sometimes weight? It helps add context."
"Yeah. This puzzled me. How would I know what their chest circumference is? I'm 6'2"" 190 and my chest circumference is 39"""
"I'm 5'9"" am most people my height seem t wear a medium. I am almost always a large as I need the extra shoulder width. "
@ ALL DANISH PEOPLE 
I'm 5'9/160 and I think this is a great post. 
"Size charts are bae, especially when ordering shit from overseas eg Asian sizing"
"Yep. I'm 5'9"" and 210ish. Knowing either without greater context is pretty useless. I have a 29"" inseam, so my legs are shorter than most people my height but my torso is longer. Similarly, I could be muscular, fat, or both. For me, I'm just fat. And that information still doesn't cover that my chest is larger than normal (even for being overweight at my weight). In t-shirts, a large often fits everywhere but my chest, while an xl may fit better on my chest and is a mystery elsewhere. Unfortunately, that makes clothing that fits well and is affordable difficult to find, and it makes looking at what someone with my height and weight says about what fits them not especially useful without more information. "
They are easy references.
"Everyone knows this. You know why people give these measurements? Because posting on a forum isn't a job. 

Giving height/weight/build is the closest approximation you can give vs not saying anything at all when someone asks how something fits. It's above and beyond for someone to take the effort to catalog the measurement of 6 different parts of a shirt post shrinkage. "
"JUST STOP GUYS

JUST STOP"
"See that's actually helpful because you **can see the model**. 

People here all the time ask for height and weight and size without any further context.

I personally only think height is helpful if you're on the more extreme ends i.e. ""6'9"" guy looking for OCBD that has long enough arms/hem."" Even then, measurements will get you much *much* further. "
I never got why they didn't just put measurements on there instead. I think models usually have them anyway on their agency page. 
i'm convinced that's a complete lie and they just put it on there
"Wait, I think this is actually one of the most useful things."
"This shit I'm 6'2 and weigh 163 pounds, almost always the shit they are wearing fits perfectly, that is if I dont move, otherwise 80 percent of the time, the shit is too small. I wear a large, hell sometimes in XL depending on brand."
https://www.themodestman.com/clothing-industry-sizes/
Honestly this is better than nothing. 
I actually find it incredibly helpful to see the height of the model wearing a certain size. Weight shouldn't be an issue but Model height certainly helps (for me at least).
"No, but at least it's a relevant descriptor of fit."
"In general sizing is useless, I am 175, 60kg and can wear things from small to large."
"I feel you, and if it's not that sensitive, it's ok sometimes to wing it. If I'm splashing 500 on some trousers though, that's when I want to make sure they're going to fit"
"I think it's a combination of not having the same variation between hips, waist, chest that women's bodies often do. So height and weight is generally an okay ballpark. And further that ballpark is probably good enough for how much effort guys want to put into picking out a shirt or pair of pants.

I also wouldn't be surprised if far more women than men had a decent idea of what their measurements are."
"FFA is pretty far ahead of MFA in many respects. 

The general answer is that because MFA is so big, a lot of how it operates depends on the lowest common denominator, which means a lower standard of knowledge and a lower quality of effort. "
"Personally, I think it has a lot to do with how little exposure men have to sizing information in general. Given the demographic here, a lot of guys are just making their first dress shirt purchase maybe. It's only at that stage that you really have to think about sizing properly. Most OCBDs are still alphabet sizing. So, it's very easy to just say ""I'm an M in most brands"" which is essentially meaningless, but much more so when it comes to women's fashion. The sheer variety of clothes, I'm sure, also has something to do with it. "
"Men generally don't have the same big shifts between chest/waist/hip/thigh as much as women do.

"
"It might just be that a lot of men don't care as much about clothing, so they come here looking for lower-level advice.

Or it could be because social pressures encourage women to think more about their bodies in painstaking detail, whereas, if a man thinks he's fat, he usually doesn't think about hips or ratios or this or that, he kind of just thinks he's fat.

Or maybe it's actually more important to the way your clothing fits. Not all men's clothing has to fit slim and precise at all points. You want a perfect full-body fit on a suit, but you really just don't care about all those details on a tee shirt, and just get something that pretty much fits.

Or maybe men's clothing tends to come in simpler sizes, which in turn simplifies our perspective.

Or maybe all of these things are all biased guesses on my part informed largely by social norms and I should just shut up now."

"Yeah, I appreciate when people include their height when talking about certain pieces. It helps add context ‚Äî¬†if a 6'4"" guy says a shirt is too short on him but doesn't list their height, it doesn't help me at all and actually misleads me, because I'm 5'7""."
"As someone with a really long torso (I‚Äôm 5‚Äô7‚Äù, the only person I know who‚Äôs taller than me sitting down is 6‚Äô7‚Äù) height is a terrible gauge. I‚Äôd rather know the length of the shirt. Conversely, my legs are way shorter, so inseam is key. "

That's why I've come to appreciate Mr. Porter since they have the actual product measurements for a lot of stuff. It's very helpful for Japanese brands and others that I'm not totally familiar with.

I do see that happen a lot. Having large muscular legs and having large chubby legs look different, and it's pretty easy to tell when someone is claiming something that ain't so. Even tighter-fitting pants on people with muscle but low body fat look passable, but when there's high BF you start to get the sausage casing look.

"Been feeling bucket hats a LOT lately, especially when it's worn in a more classic menswear context.  It's got it's roots in [ivy](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/10/34/52/103452bb36605f073ba9958b4ebd68ed.jpg)

"The terrible thing about this is that what I'm about to suggest is going to sound trite, but it's really not: just wear what you want and don't worry about it.

The biggest difference between somebody in their 30s and somebody in their 20s is that the person in their 30s is more comfortable in their own skin.  But, the way that said person got comfortable in their own skin was through the life experience they received in their 20s.

Don't fall into the trap of defining yourself in terms of your age or what you are not (not in your 30s, not a ""man""), and definitely don't fall into the trap of defining your own manhood in terms of your age - one's masculinity, like one's style, is something that comes from within, and there isn't a set age where one becomes a ""real man.""  Some men come into their own in their late teens or early twenties, and some still haven't matured in their 30s or 40s.

Define yourself in terms of who you actually are, and wear the clothes that make you feel good.  If you want to wear a sports jacket and button-down shirt to school every day, find some you like and wear it.  And then, it won't really matter what age group you'll be in - once you're comfortable enough in your own shin, you'll look and feel it."
"The best thing to do is to look up styles you like and try to emulate them! 

I like that lighter wash fitted jeans are in, I wear them with a pair of boots and a peach/tan shirt and I think that's a really awesome style.

At this age you can really wear whatever you want... button down, untucked, jeans, boots. Flannel, jeans, boots. Button down, shorts (7 inch inseam or die), sperrys/canvas sneakers. T shirt, shorts, sperrys/canvas sneakers. And many more.

Some things I recommend: 1. have a nice pair of boots that can be dressed up slightly or dressed down. I rock redwing iron rangers in the 8111 color. They're very durable and will last me for decades if I Oil and resole them, and they are very versatile in terms of fashion.
2. Get jeans that fit you well. Not too skinny and not too baggy are how I like them, find ones you like and get some lighter and darker washes. 

You're at a good age where you can really wear whatever you want, it seems like you're at college and don't want to be too fancy/formal, so look up some casual outfits and scout those out on your shopping runs

Usually I wear skinny jeans or chinos when it's colder, and chino shorts when it's warmer. Chinos I get from Abercrombie mostly (since I'm short and A&F has chinos for shorter people). Some from Banana Republic as well though. Shorts I almost get them all from J. Crew, but some are from Uniqlo.

For jeans: I own one of each of these brands => Armani, American Eagle, J. Brand, 7 For All Mankind, G-Star, Nudie (this one is a great one for younger people), AG. While a lot of these sound expensive, I got most of the higher end jeans from Saks Off 5th, so everything ended up being like 60-70$ max (J. Brand jeans were 40$ !!! hella good steal). I did pay almost 100$ on the Nudie jeans though.

Button up shirts => UNIQLO or J. Crew

Sweaters: Banana Republic, Ted Baker (wait for the sales!)

Shoes: Common Projects (definitely on the more expensive side), but cheaper alternatives can be the Nike Killshot, Cole Haan, german army trainers, etc

I wear a lot of running shoes too since i exercise. You could consider skinnier joggers as regular everyday wear as well, since they look pretty fashionable sometimes."

He has some age appropriate styles, especially revolving around leather jackets. 

Also, in terms of wearing suits. 

It will depend on your discipline and school. But, generally final and penultimate year students wearing suits is fine, since most people will assume youre at an internship or going to an interview."
"Don‚Äôt wait for guys your age to start ‚Äúdressing like a man.‚Äù  I‚Äôm pushing 40 and I live in NYC and a lot of guys my age still wear hoodies and jeans out to most social functions.  A lot of men don‚Äôt even own one suit or blazer/sportcoat.  I‚Äôve seen men (plural) show up to funerals in black jeans and black t-shirts.

James Bond reflects a fantasy world where most men are impeccably dressed all the time, but unless you hang out exclusively with wealthy people, as you age into your 20s and 30s there won‚Äôt really be a time where most guys dress in nicer / more formal clothing most of the time. There will be times when you go out to someone‚Äôs 30th birthday party in a trendy bar and feel a little overdressed in a blazer.  Dress like James Bond now if you want to ‚Äî most guys will dress like shlubs for most of your adult life and women always appreciate a guy who‚Äôs dressed nice."
"Wear what you like, just make sure it fits.

I'm in my late 20s, and I still wear shorts and tees out all the time. The difference now compared to me in high school is that I'm wearing things that fit well. And I also put on like 50lbs over 8 years in the gym. "
"... 20s pull off anything lol, I can tell that you're not 30 because you can't project the confidence ... so you'll likely get lumped into the kid crowd unless you dress a bit better and have more confidence then a kid. It'll pan out "
Just dress like reviewbrah.
"Oh hey man, I'm basically in the exact same situation as you. 
Tips: 
start wearing button downs or roll-up their sleeves. 

Wear a watch, personal preference, smart watches and gold/silver colored brings maturity-ness. Also trendy and everyday wear.

Own a good ""workout"" (joggers/running shoes/hoodie) outfit for those days you don't want to dress nice/lazy to get up for morning lectures. 

Also look at denim jackets, and a good pair of boots/or multiple (beige, or some neutral color, black doesn't look well). And jeans. Many jeans that will fit, black, blue. don't go ripped, and do not go baggy. 
Chinos: red brown, olive, dark brown, beige, etc.

A good white colored pair of shoes, and start looking into professional/office wear shoes for later.

Spring/Fall/Winter: Layer w/ button downs. summer: tshirts/floral button downs/shorts/sandals 

Body mods: tattoos and piercings do good justice when it fits you. IMO, only go small(never big or gauged) ear piercings if you want, you attract the wrong vibe when you Pierce anywhere else (visible). 
Tattoos can be sentimental, typically don't go full sleeve/any other body part unless you really want it to look good(hurts and permanent), some tat places do temporary (wear and wash) if you want to try it out. 

Make sure everything fits your personal style and you're comfortable with it. feel free to tweak what I said.

Edit: oh yes. Red wing boots. Links and pictures later.
OH. ALSO. Get a nice backpack/messenger bag. using Timbuk2, but Chrome's nice too.
"
"I‚Äôm also 20. I wear a lot of button downs. Literally own like 25 different casual button downs. Mostly secret wash shirts from J Crew. All have different plaids, solids, and stripes.

Get yourself a couple pairs of chinos, I‚Äôd recommend navy/green/khaki/gray.
 
You should own one dark indigo pair of denim and one light wash pair.

Some basic tees and a couple of stripe tees would look great on its own or under your casual button downs.

From there you have plenty of outfits to work with. You can add a layer like a denim jacket which is so versatile. I‚Äôve been wearing a lot of light blazers or a shirt jacket over my button downs since I work retail and it‚Äôs been hot.

This is just my style and not for everyone though. So I don‚Äôt how you‚Äôd like to dress. You might be more streetwear than me"
"At this age, the fit matters. Otherwise, you'll start to look older or younger than you really are e.g. I know a guy who dresses very trad but looks good in it coz his clothes fit him well. In college, no one cares what you wear but college students are still in that self-aware stage. By the time, you reach senior year, you'd have realised this. "
"Not all ""real men"" (I hate this phrase) dress like Daniel Craig, where you live and what lifestyle you have matters a lot more than what age you are. If I dressed like Craig with my lifestyle and where I live i'd look like a joke. You're at the age where you should go into stores with no preconceived notions about what you want to dress like and buy items that you personally like. Don't worry about if they work with the rest of your wardrobe or not, just buy stuff you like and over time you'll learn how to style them and thats how you get your own personal style. I feel that sometimes learning to dress on the internet stunts all personal growth because you aspire to an idea that doesn't always match who you are and you might end up with a closet full of clothes that you don't feel comfortable in. You're 20 years old, wear what you want to wear and worry about everything else later."
"dress whichever way you like man. if you like 'real men' clothes wear them. I'm in my late 20s and I don't like them, I like to be as comfortable as possible. I'm really testing the boundaries of the smart casual dress code at work but nobody really cares "
"really 20 is a perfect age. dont think of it like this. early twenties people are the most trendy, the most desirable. they are in many ways what kids want to become and 'men' want to go back to. James bond? wishes he was 20 again and could get out of his boring suits.

Alpha M pretends he is still, but really the wrinkles are catching up to him fast. his most popular vid has him wearing a denim jacket, earbells and a black shirt. you can copy that easily. thats a young mans style. actually he only rarely wears 'old guy' blazers or 'business style' button downs. he is quite a good role model to follow for young guys style wise. so just copy him, do not copy james bond. and you will be fine. "
"Im 24 and i generally wear pretty basic stuff. Generally hiking button downs, jeans, leather boots, and a ball cap of some sort with ray ban wayferers. I think i look pretty much my age, but i think like everyone else is saying, just wear stuff that you think expresses who you are. Im living in cali but i went to school in the midwest, where i kinda came of age, and the way i dress definitely looks like that. But i think im a midwest guy anyway so i think that dressing that way expresses to others who i am. I also try to dress pretty timelessly, i dont go with trends"
"Just buy one great fitting pair of jeans, some comfy but cool boots, plain canvas sneakers, some tees, a parka and a cool leather jacket (thrift it or eBay it, more beat up the better). Maybe add a college sweater. "
Ditch the t-shirts and shorts that go below your knees.
"Use denim & bomber jacket instead of blazers...

Wear some simple ripped jeans;

Use necklace and bracelets;

Clean sneakers;"
"One jacket that I would always recommend to pretty much anybody is a denim jacket.That will go with pretty much anything you are gonna decide to wear.
If you want something a little more dressy then jeans then always chinos.A pair of tan chinos goes with pretty much.
You should definitely have a dark wash pair of jeans aswell.
White sneakers go with any style you can think of."
Dress like a baby or a grandpa then. Not sure why you had to post this   
"Came for malefashionadvice, left with malelifeadvice."
Exactly.
"Wow came here just to say this. I‚Äôm in my late 20‚Äôs and dress differently than many others my age. 

Have you ever seen those grandpa or grandmas with impeccable style rocking streetwear? They are us when we grow up. For example, check out Maye Musk (Elon‚Äôs Mom) with a recent shoot with her wearing Supreme and Nike x Off White "
"I mean, at the end of the day he's not going to be treated that differently for rocking more formal clothes, but the biggest differences between a 20 year old and 30 year old are way more than comfort in ones own skin. There are plenty of social things like the transition from college to the workplace (probably the biggest one) that largely affect how one will be expected to be dressed. "
"Hi, thank you for your different answer bud. I mean, I'm not afraid to dress old for the sake of it and I know that some girls like men that dress lile 'grown men', but I'm afraid people will think that I am much older than I'm actually am and 20 years old girls will think I'm too old for them lol. Is that something possible or am I wrong on this topic? I can look quite older especially if I don't shave because I have a lot of facial hair, but younger facial attributes."
"Hey man, thanks for your answer :)

However, what is 8111 color? Also, how slim do you wear your pants? Do you also wear chinos? I like my jeans slim and tapered yet not skinny, but with chinos I find that it is hard to find some that are slimmer."
"Hey man, thank you for your reply, I will look up your links!"
That jacket on #5 is amazing. May I ask where you got it? 
What type of shirt would you say that yellow one is?
"To piggyback off of this already awesome reply I‚Äôm quite literally in the same boat as you (20, just finished 1st year of college) and when I first started getting into male fashion the first thing I did was check out the [basic bastard](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/5da1dc/the_basic_bastard_basic_wardrobe_and_inspiration/?st=ivl4t7q9&sh=cd5c007f). Alongside the basic stuff like a clean pair of jeans and some shirts, a bomber and a nice pair of boots also goes a long way. 

On a final note the most important thing to realize is that you‚Äôll look best in what you feel most comfortable in. I recently ran into a guy who rocked a fur coat in the winter and he totally pulled it off. You may get a few comments here and there in the beginning (and most of them will be complements tbh) but if you dress nicely every day people will realize this is how you enjoy dressing and will accept it. No matter how you dress, the way you wear the clothes is exponentially more important. Younger women will be attracted to your confidence and now what color your OCBD is. "
"Hey man thanks for your reply. What running shoes do you own? Also, have you been able to find skinny/slim chinos that are kind of like the same jeans taper? All chinos that I find even uf they claim to be slim are mostly straight cut."
"Yeah we have many networking event (engineering school), so I guess I could have a nice suit when I will go to those. Glad to see other people here know Alpha M haha"
+1 on that. I used to be the skinny kid and I noyiced that my attitude and other's perception of me has changed a lot since I've been training.
Can‚Äôt believe this isn‚Äôt the top comment. While Ill fitting suits may not be the most trendy thing rn he legit has a personal style and just wears suits everyday because that‚Äôs what he wants to do. 
"what kinda white shoes u recommend?

also, i have RW 9014s, should i have gotten the brown instead? lol i feel like i made the wrong choice"
"Mmm I'm not too sure about this. With this train of thought, you get people with blue hair and all sorts of bizarre piercings in the name of being  ""different"". People would also wear very baggy suits and dress pants as they are more comfortable than your in trend slimmer suits. Fashion and trends are a thing and going in a store buying random items you like will result in outfits that do not match."
"> Ditch the t-shirts

but y"
what kinda sneakers 
"It sounds like you think that there is a distinct difference between being 20 and 30. There isn¬¥t and you are most certainly not old when you are 30. 

I think there are two distinctions here - either you dress like a teenager, or you dress like a man. There are obviously some items to avoid; ties do age you up and so on, but that's about it. "
"I would suggest not worrying about that.  When you actually meet and connect with ""Miss Right,"" she's not going to care about whether you look a bit older than your age (and if she does, she's probably not ""Miss Right"").

Just be yourself and enjoy your 20s - it's quite a ride, as I recall, and it just gets better from here."
"As a female reading this thread, I can vouch that many girls find maturity attractive, independent of apparent age. Dressing well because you take care of your appearance signals confidence.

Other men might make fun of you but usually they're just jealous that you have your own style.

Also, physical fitness makes pretty much any fitted clothes attractive, though it's not necessary."
">30's...too old

*Sigh"
You're thinking too much about it. Just chill and Pl don't forget to put your pants on one leg at a time. 
"So the 8111 color is brown... not too dark though... the other colors are definifely tan... they're great colors, but they're not versatile enough. The 8111s are dark enough for business casual with khakis but also are right at home with jeans and a button down or jeans and a t shirt. 

I'm on mobile so I can't see my previous comment... but if I didn't mention, sierra trading has red wing boots for like 50% of retail price, the only catch is that they're factory seconds so like a stitch or two is out of place.... DEFINITELY worth the money.

As for pants... how do I like mine...? I have slightly thicker legs from years of lifting so I like a regular fit through the thigh and tapered through the calve. If you have slimmer legs or don't lift, a slim straight fit or a slim tapered fit may work best for you... try on a lot of jeans in mans sizes and see what works best (jeans vary in each size so try a size above or below in the length and waist... one 32x34 may be tight as hell on me, but another may be baggy as hell. It's all about finding that one good pair of jeans). 

I would recommend a dark dark blue pair. A dark blue pair can be dressed up slightly but also dressed down, lighter pairs can't really be dressed up as well. 

If you have any questions let me know... hope this helps man!"
"[8111 color](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=8111+color)

I'm right around your age. I wear both chinos and jeans. Largely just chinos until recently but I've been on a bit of a raw denim tear lately. I'm skinny as hell and haven't had a problem finding pants slim enough - just try stuff on. If slim tapered isn't enough (and it wasn't for me), try skinny tapered. Honestly, don't be scared off by even super skinny sometimes. If it fits and you think it looks good, its fine."
"i bought it with a gift card i was gifted for macy's, but i dont think they sell it anymore. 

INC International Concepts Men's Ombr√© Overcoat was the name i think"
"which one? the one from the first is an overshirt i thrifted, and i think the tag says faded glory, the t shirt is just a pocket shirt from uniqlo"
"Absolutely. Let me send you a link for all my essentials.

I'll start with running shoes. I've been running regularly for a long time, and I've had a lot of running shoes. But I think my absolute favorite running shoe is the Nike Flyknit LunarEpic II. Looks like this: [https://www.goat.com/sneakers/lunarepic-low-flyknit-2-multicolor-863779-003](https://www.goat.com/sneakers/lunarepic-low-flyknit-2-multicolor-863779-003)

I can't find the color I have a the moment, but most of Nike's colorways are bright (which is something I really like). I love these because they have a cushion-y sole (not too soft where it's impossible to run though), and they actually look really good.

Here are the skinny chinos I wear => [https://www.abercrombie.com/shop/us/p/super-slim-chino-pants-9702742?categoryId=6452572&seq=07&faceout=model](https://www.abercrombie.com/shop/us/p/super-slim-chino-pants-9702742?categoryId=6452572&seq=07&faceout=model)

These are as close to jeans tapering as you can get. Leg opening is about 12 inches, which is definitely small enough to my liking :D

Banana Republic Fulton Chino => [https://bananarepublic.gap.com/browse/product.do?pid=795221132&CAWELAID=120302000000586198&CAGPSPN=pla&CAAGID=41221941530&CATCI=pla-294357560067&tid=brpl000001&kwid=1&ap=7&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI0ezkjtyc3AIVDNRkCh2i9QFwEAQYASABEgJVAvD\_BwE](https://bananarepublic.gap.com/browse/product.do?pid=795221132&CAWELAID=120302000000586198&CAGPSPN=pla&CAAGID=41221941530&CATCI=pla-294357560067&tid=brpl000001&kwid=1&ap=7&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI0ezkjtyc3AIVDNRkCh2i9QFwEAQYASABEgJVAvD_BwE)

Also a skinny fit chino. Not as tapered but I still really like it!"
"Just gonna throw this out there: those people with ""blue hair and all sorts of bizarre piercings"" likely have more confidence than you're displaying.

As everyone else is saying, dress how you'd like. But that also means respecting that there's people who like dressing in streetwear, dying their hair, or a plethora of other styles that you wouldn't. "
"Its not buying random items, its buying items that you personally like. Then you take them home and find ways to wear them. At first it will look weird, but you'll get the hang of how to style them. And they are yours, an extension of your personality, a part of you, reflecting your past experiences."
T shirt is for babby. Real men wear long sleeves all the time
"ehh, at a college setting there is a pretty big difference between being 20 and being 30"
"What I mean by that is that a freshman 19 years old girl in my school may believe that I am much older than I am, 30 for instance, and not be interested on first sight. 20 years olds and 30 years olds have a lot different livesm when you are 30, you have a career and are more mature than when you are a student."
"I have a lot of chino pants from when i was a larger size, but not they are too loose, esp on the waist and calves area(kinda long too.). Should i just buy a bunch of new pants or is there a way to like tailor them or something?"
Thanks. If nothing else it gave me an objective.
"Damn thanks man, that's appreciated"
"Some styles are trending and fit well together. I like casual streetwear but not japanese techwear, but I can still find it good looking on people. Why? Because it is a good fit that respects some basoc fashion rules. People with blue hair and that stuff are trying to look like dissidents or anarchists that do not respect the system. The problem is that they all dress from the same punk lookbook, hence simply compying a trend someone started instead of actually being unique. I don't know a single confident /good looking girl with blue hair. I know many girls that have unnatural colored hair and they all lack confidence and often have a lot to deal with in the mental health departement. It is only a cry for attention."
I guess that's an expensive way to build a wardrobe.
I can assure you no 19 year old girls would ever confuse a 20 year old boy from a 30+ man... especially based on clothes. 
"Honestly I would look at the prices for new pants and the prices for tailoring and choose the cheaper option. 

Tailoring would possibly be a better option, especially because it may cost less.

If you get new pants try to see if they have an athletic fit because those are more fitted on the calves, but have more room in the thighs and butt and are fitted properly on the waist"
"MKI do a similar one. Iirc the design was popularised by Acne a bit back, round f/w you'll get a lot of copycat versions."
Thats completely ridiculous. My mom has blue hair and she's a librarian. She just likes how it looks. And can't you see how ridiculous you sound when you make fun of people who dress from a punk lookbook when this sub is 99&#37; dressing from established lookbooks?
It's cheaper than planning it out meticulously only for you to realise you don't feel comfortable in the clothes after you bought them all.
What exactly do you say to a tailor? Lol. Do they like prefer specific measurements or should I just say I want it more fitted on the calves and stuff. Also do you go to a legit dude or is it some old Asian lady 
"I don't think you understood my point. I'm not making fun of people dressing from trends or lookbooks, I'm actually encouraging it. Why? Because trends and lookbooks exists for the sole reason that they provide well matching outfits that respect fashion rules to everyone. The problem I have with the punk/unnatural hair color crew is that they are trying to make a statement and claim to be different when all they do is partake in a trend with some sort of message to society. 

I know 2 50+ years old women who have blue and purple hair and they do not seem very fine to me. They both say they wanted to be different and felt to them that it was nice, but that's a ridiculous argument. If I claimed that I liked to wear baggy cargo shorts that come below my knee, socks and sandals, a shirt with red flames and skulls, and a fanny pack, people would just find my outfit absurd because it does not look good. However, most people who wear these 'dad outfits' don't have any pretension towards their style, whereas your blue colored crew think they are special."
"So when you go to a tailor you almost always would put the article of clothing on and they would pin it and make t more fitted and mark where they need to bring the clothes in from. 

The person probably doesn't make a difference, but I like to go to a guy because I think the guy has a different insight into how guy jeans should fit. Kinda like getting a haircut... a guy has gotten his hair cut shorter and knows what to look for, common problems, things that may be annoying, etc... I prefer male tailors for that reason (although there isn't much of a difference)"
"I think dressing from lookbooks is pretty lame, so I see this is where we disagree. I used to think like you but honestly the only way ive felt comfortable in my clothes is to disregard (lookbooks) them completely. I think its silly that people feel the need to copy others in order to dress well. 


Edit: I know this is an unpopular opinion but its just that, my opinion. I know people have different ways of doing stuff and just because I feel this way doesn't make other was of dressing less valid. I guess its also because of where im from, if I told people I try to dress like James Bond id get ridiculed. The west coast is very anti-tryhard lol"

Denim top was made with denim scraps that I bought(and a friend kindly donated an old pair of Dickies), then I patched them into large enough pieces for pattern cutting, and finally embroidered it when I was done sewing the garment together. I plan to alter it in the future to extend the sleeves and add in some side seam pockets. I'll likely redo some of the embroidery as well as add some more.

where r u?
Definitely a way-out there outfit. It's definitely cool but i think it definitely depends on the context. If you're going out to a club or something or a music festival its dope. If you're going to the mall or a restaurant its not too appropiate.
"This really just isn't working, my man. If the tee was swapped for something not-cropped and the jeans were less wide-open ripped and closer to [something like this](https://lsco.scene7.com/is/image/lsco/Levis/clothing/181810266-front-pdp.jpg?$grid_desktop_bottoms$), that would be a good start."

Awesome look! Love the Birks. Do you have an IG I can follow?
Love the trousers but that shirt is toooooo see through.
"I like this but agree with u/Metcarfre the shirt is a bit too thin for this level of formality. Tucked and buttoned.

This shirt is killer but would be better suited worn untucked and unbuttoned a bit or over a pastel v neck.

I get it though. I have 3 that *look* the same from a distance but vary wildly in thickness and therefore how they drape and collar pops.

Jcrew is the thickest I have and would suit this fit.

Brooks bro is thinner and 6 years old or so and I can't wear it other than super casual as described above.

Sillhoute  is lovely though, I like the fit on the whole. "

"Loafers, derbies, chukkas, mocs, or boat shoes seem like they would work better.

Or are you literally required to wear high-lacing boots?"
"i think you could go either way, but that shirt is like cpeters level tight, which kind of takes away from the vibe of a camp collar shirt"
"Yeah, no shade at the dude. Just personal preference. "
"It's not really a matter of slim vs relaxed silhouette. The shirt is just too small - the buttons on your chest are pulling, and the ultra-slim fit gives the fit a very weird triangular silhouette when paired with the slim-straight pants and chunky boots.

The shoulders look like they're about right, so I imagine that tailoring the sides is what caused the issue. I would urge you to hesitate before tailoring any more shirts to be this slim.

There is absolutely a middle ground between ""too tight"" and ""relaxed"", but I really think you've missed it here."
"Thanks! Been lurking for a while, finally decided it was time to participate. "
You could also try espadrilles/loafers which might go with this. 
Fair enough. You do you.

See, this is why I have this sub.  Thanks man, noted for next wear!"
"Yeah, I could see that."
"I think it‚Äôs just the material; I always do the ‚Äúchest out‚Äù test when my tailor is pinning and there‚Äôs no tug.  Definitely roomy in the chest still.

Not sure on the triangle thing, but then again my torso is shaped like a Dorito. Either way, a lot of the female clients at the office loved the shirt, so it definitely did its intended job lol"
"Honestly, the boots are fine! I think they look really good here. I wouldn't obsess over what you combine them with; raw denim and boot heads pull off these kinds of combinations all the time. "

"Daring doesn't mean better though. I don't agree with a lot of the winners here either, but I don't think a white mismatched jacket over an otherwise very safe fit should win, just because it's daring.

I also think both thegreatone and kamotejoe's fits were both equally ""daring"", but I liked kamote's better and I think he had better pictures too.

Then again, you talking about the loss of Bmash and thegreatone could have nothing to do with your next sentence, but I definitely got that impression."
"You have been a very positive influence on me, DLP. I always look forward to your feedback on my outfits and it has really helped me find my own sense of style. "

You've been a great dark horse in this whole tournament and I enjoy your styling! 
"Thanks HD! Really thought you won this round, so was surprised to see my name this morning. Will do my best!"
You brought it my man and your style is blossoming that I think your calling me inspo is quite outdated at this point (see DLP's high praise of you ;) ). 
Do you speak of things as they will be or as they should be? I hope in my heart of hearts to not see Innerpiece lose this round! 
they doubted jesus too
I appreciate that you went for me two rounds in row. Thank you for that. 
I graciously accept this loss... but the first round of cocktails are on you!
"Hell yeah. I don't have any idea how I could possibly beat you, but I'll try my best. Good luck!"
"thegreatone and KamoteJoe is not one of those I am referring to, as I agree both fits are quite nice, but the battle of bmash most certainly is! There have been several others in the first round as well that I thought have been quite boring! 

My own sensibility is such that for competition I would rather see someone try something exciting and perhaps somewhat miss than see someone play it safe....This is simply my preference and is not one that you must share ;) "
"I agree, KJ is consistently daring even though he has a pretty set aesthetic and he experiments a lot within his own style. He was one of my original inspirations and will continue to look forward to his stuff. "
"Thank you for the kind words my friend, but I am quite sure I deserve none of the credit :) "
"Thank you, I did make it myself. It was basically a bunch of denim scraps patched together and then embroidered."
Will let you borrow my geobaskets
You don‚Äôt have to rub it in!
Thank you! That means a lot to me.
"Thanks a ton. I really put a lot of energy into it, so it's super nice to hear that people like it!"
"as they will be.  if i could blindly pick my should-bes, i would opt for innerpiece, hamish, prime meridian, james bond, cashew or focused (either one! love both!), kamote, nar or dom (either! love both!), shititsthefuzz"
"Well you've already beaten two people that others expected to go far, so don't count yourself out. Looking forward to seeing what both of you bring to round 3."
"Like 90% of bmash's fits look the same though. That would be considered safe and it seems like you're contradicting yourself. Crapshooter's assessment from the battle discussion summed it up great: ""if i told you bmash would wear black derbies, black cropped pants, and tuck a black shirt into those pants, would you believe me?"" 

I'm not getting how you're saying it's a great loss to the bracket but at the same time you'd rather see people try something exciting?"
"Very, very cool stuff. Now I feel kind of bad winning knowing more about the piece. "
i thought you wanted me to win
"Before the battle thought bmash was going to take it, then you just showed up in a big way! Good luck next round!"
"That's true, even though I definitely didn't expect to. But thanks for the encouragement! I'll bring my A-game"
"Obviously we disagree on whether Bmash's fits are exciting! While I am admittedly no great fan of all black, I find Crapshooter's opinion here (and indeed in most places) a bit reductive...

There are elements here that are interesting to me, that while perhaps not groundbreaking, are certainly moreso than his opponent's - white jacket stands out very pleasingly to my eye, trouser cut is perfect, and I am a great fan of these wingtips. Moreover, this is a clothing competition but it is also a photography and styling competition. From his workspace to his hair and beard, Bmash exudes a certain je ne sais quoi..."
"lol, don't feel bad. Your fit was awesome! It reminded+inspired me that I have a paisley print shirt to finish sewing"
"Oh, I thought self sabotage was the key to success, but wtf do I know I lost twice in a single elimination bracket tournament?"

"Did a repair on my white Achilles low. Came out pretty good! Some guy walked by and stomped on the side of my shoe at a club, and it wore off the top layer showing the greyish leather underneath. I used white Angelus leather paint, and did about 8 super thin layers, I‚Äôd paint it on, then lightly tap it in all over the area, blending it with my finger so the natural leather grain would show through.

‚Äã
Eating 

* Paseos ($) - Cuban sandwiches. Long wait, cash only. Call ahead to skip line. The original shops were closed down due to a lawsuit and recently re-opened. Still good, but something is missing.
* Un Bien ($) - The original owners of Paseos opened up a new joint in Ballard. Similar foods, but this time they take card. I haven't been here yet, but from what I've heard, it's nothing short of orgasmic.
* Red Mill ($) - If you want a good traditional artery-clogging burger with hefty bacon. Cash only, long wait on nice days.
* 8oz Burgers ($) - Great burgers on Capitol Hill. Try their Kimchi burger with pork belly and kimchi.
* Yoroshiku 4649 ($) - Ramen. Good ramen. Period.
* Aloha Ramen ($) - Hawaiian-style ramen. If you like katsu in your ramen, then your go to place!
* Dick's Drive-In ($) - Famous burger place in Seattle, locations all over the city. Cash only. Get a few burgers, fries, shake for under $10.
* Thai Tom ($) - Dirtiest Thai restaurant in the city but damn, it's the best Thai in town. Cash only. Long waits, call ahead for take-out.
* Tacos Chukis ($) - Cheap and delicious tacos. Sort of hidden on Capitol Hill.
* Tat's Delicatessen ($) - Best pastrami in town.
* Mammoth ($) - Big ass sandwiches.
* Molly Moon's Ice Cream ($) - Really good ice cream, but really long waits.
* Full Tilt Ice Cream ($) - Great ice cream, really interesting flavors sometimes.

* Hello Robin ($) - Ice cream sandwich shop that uses Molly Moon‚Äôs ice cream.
* Vivace ($) - My favorite coffee shop in the city.
* Elm Coffee Roaster ($) - Somewhat new coffee joint in Pioneer Square by the stadiums. Great roasts.
* Milstead & Co ($) - Great coffee shop in Fremont. Really good cold brew. Very friendly staff. Stop by here if you‚Äôre at Gasworks and making your way into Fremont.
* Crazy Pho Cajun ($) - Best pho in Seattle. Nobody believes me. They also have a cajun pho with shrimp, crawfish and andouille sausage with a spicy broth. Pretty good but the sausage is a little off in the soup.
* El Camion ($) - Multiple locations. They have a few trucks around the city. Probably one of the best burritos in town.
* Mike‚Äôs Noodle House ($) - Hole in the wall noodle house in Chinatown/International District. Speaking Chinese seems to give you better service, but still good service regardless. Great place for a cold day‚Äôs brunch or getting over a night of drinking.
* La Carta De Oaxaca ($$) - Located in Ballard. Probably one of the best Mexican food in the city. Very popular. Don't try to go in big groups because it's very difficult to get a table. Probably one of my favorite places in Seattle.
* Maneki ($$) - Oldest Japanese Restaurant in Seattle. Servers traditional Japanese dishes as well as sushi. Has a tatami room. Reservations only, open from 530-10pm except Mondays.
* Facing East ($$) - Taiwanese food in Bellevue. Great food. Gets busy on the weekend.
* Serious Biscuit/Serious Pie ($$) - Famous chef Tom Douglas' biscuit shop. Get their fried chicken, egg and bacon on a biscuit with gravy! Die a happy man.
* Portage Bay ($$) - Most popular brunch in town. Get there early because there's always a line.
* Kedai Makan ($) - Really good Malaysian food. No seating. Just a window to pick up food. Grab some and head up to Cal Anderson park and have a little picnic and then him up Totokaelo which is across the street.
* Bakery Nouveau ($$) - Really popular bakery. Great croissants. A little on the pricier side for a bakery.
* Crumble & Flake ($) - Another bakery. Big fan of their chocolate croissants.
* Vietnam House ($$) - Probably one of the better Vietnamese restaurants in Seattle. Why? Because you only see Vietnamese people going there. FUCK TAMARIND TREE, YOU OVERPRICED YUPPY EXCUSE FOR A VIET RESTAURANT.
* Skillet ($$) - Used to be a food truck, but has a b&m now. American food. Get something with bacon jam on it.
* Americana ($$) - Good brunch. Enough said.
* Thai-Ku ($$) - Traditional Thai restaurant with more than just the typical noodle dishes. Very fragrant flavors. Go here if you want more than just pad thai.
* Sushi Kappo Tamura ($$$) - Great sushi place on Eastlake. Plug for my friend who owns it.
* Cascina Spinasse ($$$) - My favorite Italian restaurant in Seattle. Kind of upscale, but their pasta is hand/home-made. Highly recommend their tajarin al ragu o buerre a salvia (very thin egg pasta with either meat ragu or butter and sage)
* Palisade ($$$) - Located on the marina in Interbay, it has one of the best views in the city restaurant wise. Fancier, but great great food. Go for happier for a much cheaper menu.

* Canlis ($$$$) - Probably the fanciest place in Seattle. Really great ambiance and overall dining experience.

* Knee High Stocking Club - Hidden bar inside a basement of an apartment building. Need reservations to get in or get really lucky when you ring their doorbell.
* Brouwer's - Good German bar with good German food.
* Capitol Cider - Very popular place on the Hill. All sorts of ciders if that's your thing.
* Red Hook Brewery - In Woodinville. Great brewery. Go on their tour.
* Mac & Jack Brewery - Another brewery tour you should go on. Micro-brewery.

What type of activities are you interested in? First time?
Clothing wise? Food? Coffee? Drinks? I lived in Seattle for a couple years.
That's the spirit. 
"Make sure you don't wear it around your neck, or you'll restrict bloodflow to your brain..."
those are FAR too accurate
Wasn't there a thread on it? 
"To be fair, it was obliquely mentioned in the comments and was a focal point of the article.

But its also 2real4me and I can't deal with the internet resembling real life so much."
J.Crew on sale. 
No
Not unless the garment is actually reversible.
"My gf also has it, and I've learned about it a lot more from her. It's a rough disease."
üòÖ
Only reason why I want some. 
"You're thinking of loafers, not slides."
"Nah, I got the Pursuit 72 which admittedly I‚Äôd been wanting so it wasn‚Äôt completely out of the blue but damn my wallet hurts lol.  I‚Äôm gonna keep em tho I‚Äôd been wanting them."
"Unless you're asking my wallet. I totally needed a 5D IV for instagram photos, right?"
Cool I‚Äôll check it out!
Get used on Ebay.  You can get a decent body for $100 or less.  Then get a little 50mm lense for $20-50 and you are off to the races.  You can then expand your lense selection from there.  
"I got really lucky and came into some found money (target accidentally doubled up on a refund of a big ticket item and sent me a $320 gift card) so I bought something I normally wouldn‚Äôt. Got a canon rebel t6 kit with a case, memory card, and lense for $450 which I though was a good deal. Not the best entry level camera but it‚Äôs what target had available. Also my insta is linked in my WAYWT fit post! "
"I need words like this more than ever, thanks."
"Seeing

Most of these are probably touristy, so choose what you like most.

* Gas Works Park - Most well-known park in Seattle. Seen in various movies and shows. Gets busy when nice out.
* Alki Beach - Located over in West Seattle, nice view of Seattle. Nice on a warm summer day.
* Kerry Park - Very popular park with a few of the sound and downtown Seattle. Try and go on a clear day for a chance to see Mt. Rainier.
* Seattle Center - Space Needle, EMP, KeyArena
* Theo‚Äôs Chocolate Factory - Theo‚Äôs makes great chocolate and if you want to see how it‚Äôs made, go on their tour and get some free chocolate!
* Mariners game. Cheap tickets at what I think is one of the best parks in baseball.
* Underground Tour in Pioneer Square.
* Kayaking in either Lake Union or Lake Washington. You can go to the Univ. of Washington Aquatic Center and rent kayaks or canoes for cheap and find your way over towards the abandoned freeway.
* Paddleboarding in Lake Union. Very popular lake for paddleboarding, but also has a lot of water traffic.
* If you have access to bikes, I recommend taking them onto a Ferry to Bainbridge Island. Explore the island and get some Mora's ice cream to cool off.
* Tons of museums, a lot of them free.
* EMP is definitely one of the most popular museums in Seattle. Lots of cool exhibits this summer. Pacific Science Center is connected to the EMP, but it's a bit outdated.
* The Seattle Art Museum is also nice. If you have time on the 6th, you should go to the SAM because it's free on the first Thursday of every month.
* If you're Asian or are into Asian culture, I recommend The Wing Luke Museum and the Asian Art Museum. The Wing Luke Museum is correctly running a Bruce Lee exhibit which is pretty cool.
* There's the MOHAI (Museum of History And Industry) in South Lake Union. Exhibits on the history of Seattle and the industries that developed here.
* The Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture is located on the University of Washington campus. Lots of interesting stuff about Seattle's native history. Once you're done there, you can walk around the university. It's a very beautiful campus during the summer. Grab some lunch on The Ave (University Avenue), find a shady spot in The Quad on campus and have a nice summer picnic.
* The Frye Art Museum is located on Capitol Hill. Lots of 19th century Euro and American art pieces. Entrance is free.
* Olympic Sculpture Park is located down by the waterfront and not too far from Pike Place Market. Hit the park up if you happen to be visiting that area.
* There's also always the Seattle Aquarium and Woodland Park Zoo. I'm a big fan of our zoo. I actually like it more than the San Diego Zoo.
‚Äã
Hiking 

Stars for difficulty

* Rattlesnake Ridge (*) - Pretty easy hike with a decent view. Gets lots of traffic but very well maintained.
* Little Si (*) - Sister hike to Mt. Si. Very easy, family friendly.
* Wallace Falls (*) - Another easy, family friendly hike. Cools falls at the end.
* Snoqualmie Falls (*) - Not really a hike, but a great view at the end.
* Lake 22 (*) - Another alpine lake. Great hike. Pretty light hike, but far from Seattle.
* Big Four Ice Caves (*) - More of a walk but cool ice caves at the end.
* Poo Poo Point (*) - Relatively easy hike with a great view. You can also watch hang-gliders since this is a jump point.
* Mt. Si (**) - A little bit tougher hike, but great view of Mt. Rainier at the top on a clear day.
* Bridal Veils Fall (*) - Detour of the Lake Serene hike. Gorgeous rushing waterfall.
* Lake Serene (**) - One of my favorite hikes! Very serene if you're able to get up there when there isn't as much traffic.
* Blanca Lake (**) - Gorgeous lake at the end of a 3.5mi trek through the Mt. Baker National Forest. Can be pretty tough, but the lake is definitely worth it. If you want an easier hike with a similar view, I recommend Diablo Lake.
* Tiger Mountain (**) - I don't have a lot to say about this one.
* Gothic Basin (**) - A pretty popular one this year. Really cool 360 view from the top.
* Mailbox Peak (***) - People use this as a practice for Mt. Adams and Mt. Rainier. Pretty tough but amazing view at the top and a mailbox.
* Mt. St. Helens - (-***) - Really depends where you start. You can drive up a lot higher to the observatory and start from there or you can start from the base and go up for about 5 hrs.
* Mt. Rainier (-****) - Mt. Rainier. Again, you can drive up to various points and hike around. Multi-day trip if you start from the base.

"This is long but it's saved from another friends visit there.

I left the coffee stuff in there just in case, with a few recommendations for things to do as well.

Big hits for the clothing stuff:
1. Thrifts, Crossroads, Buffalo Exchange - Seattle is a wealthy city and thus you can find excellent stuff.
2. Totokaelo - From Rick to Acne
3. Blue Owl - American Heritage and Japanese Denim
4. Downtown for all your box and luxury stores: All Saints, Rack, Suitsupply, Gucci, LV etc.


Pike Place:Touristy but worth it, I love this place



Food/Drink

1. Piroshky Piroshky - Russian dumplings with veggie options. Located just outside the actual market

2. Vendors inside- Lots of fruit stand with free samples, any food you find inside will be great.

3. Beechers Cheese- Local favorite and for good reason. Also just outside the actual market.

4. Storyville Roasters- Great coffee shop that is on the third floor of the building across from Pike Place. Just keep walking up the stairs. Espresso is top notch. 5.French Press is so/so. View is fantastic. 

Seattle Coffee Works- Get a pour over, french press, chemex here. Good shit.

6. Biscuit Bitch - 10 minute walk away. Buttery delicious biscuits, always a line. Worth it. There's a French place next door that is also fucking bomb.

7. The Pike Brewing Company - Brewery, pretty okay



Shop

1. Outdoor Retail Stores - Kavu, The North Face, and Fjllaraven all have stores in the general vicinity

2. There's an All Saints, Suitsupply, Nordstrom Rack in the downtown area too

Off the top of my head I don't know many places down here and it'll all be pretty expensive



See/Do

1. Seattle Art Museum- It's awesome, check and see what exhibits they will have but I love this place. A whole section on ancient artifacts that always fascinated me. Like shit from Moses time.

2. The gum wall - Its gross but its a photo opportunity, hidden within Pike Place

3. They throw fish in the entrance to Pike. Everyone loves it, it is pretty cool.

4. Overlook the sound. Beautiful nature shit.

5. Explore all of Pike, it has 2 floors and winds all over the place. Lot's of interesting things to see, smell and hear, even if you only pass by.

6. Original Starbucks barf



Bellevue:- Admittedly not Seattle at all but the best East Asian food outside of Sushi



Food

1. Palace BBQ- Best Korean BBQ I've ever had ever. It's unreal. Ashley and I went probably 10+ times.

2. Peking - ""Chinese"" food place that is run by Koreans. Great food, nice people.

3. Hakkaido Ramen Santouka - Cute little Ramen place with serious flavor. Has veggie options usually, might check menu before hand.



Shop

1. The Bellevue Square Mall - Malls seem lame but if you need anything this is a Bougie ass mall. Super nice shit in there.

Includes Uniqlo, an Allen Edmonds Store, Nordstrom



See/Do

1. The square is nice park to chill around with plenty of good food in the area, also across the street from the mall.

2. The Botanical Gardens are pleasant though not as good as the rose garden or rhododendron gardens or the cherry blossoms in the U district in Seattle proper 



Fremont: Quirky little area, V hip. V hilly, bring the hiking shoes fam, jk but actually really hilly. 



Food/Drink

1. Pel Ming Dumpling Czar - Russian Dumplings with veggie options. Delicious.

2. El Paseo - Maybe the best sandwich I have ever eaten. It's a shack on a hill, always a line but worth the wait. Veggie options though they may just be rice and beans. Can't remember if they have a veggie sandwich or not. it is away from the rest of these options but only about a 7 min walk

3. Flying Apron - Vegan hippie bakery. Pretty dope shit though.

4. Pho Than brothers - Good but not great Pho.

5. Milstead and Co - One of my favorite coffee places in Seattle, can't go wrong with drip or espresso drinks. 

6. Fremont Brewing- Down the road a way but also delicious beer and a cute location looking out over the sound

7. Cafe Turko - Next door to Milstead, solid turkish food

8. Nuna Ramen - Good Ramen and Poke

9. Joule - Korean Fusion, check for Veggie options, delicious food in a very cool building. It is a bit further away from things than the rest of the other possibilities.



Shop

1. Warby Parker Store

2. Fremont Vintage Mall - Lots of cool retro stuff, underground

3. Blue Owl Workshop - Japanese Denim and American Heritage brands



See/Do

1. The Fremont Troll - Famous, under the bridge, get pictures, up the hill from milstead coffee and cafe turko

2. Lenin Statue - Shocker, Seattle has a Vladimir Lenin statue. Take a picture with the communist.

3. Gasworks park - A bit outside of Fremont but a quintessential park in Seattle, overlooks downtown and the sound. All the old factory parts are still around, giving it a cool steam punk vibe. Take coffee from Milstead and go walk around here.

4. Rose Garden - Every type of Rose you could ever imagine, AND ITS FREE

5. Zoo- Next to the Rose Garden, Above Average but nothing special

Ballard: My favorite neighborhood, it's the traditional Nordic hood



Food/Drink

1. Pestle Rock - Traditional Northern Thai food. V good. As ever with Thai food it is Veg friendly

2. Percy's- Good bar, good food.

3. Carpenter and Walrus - A bit fancy, but worth it. Such good seafood.

4. Ballard Coffeeworks- Same as Seattle coffeeworks but in Ballard

5. Larsen's Bakery - Danish Bakery. Go. Get the Kringle. You're welcome.

6. Ballard Pizza Co - Pretty good pizza.

7. Hattie's Hat Restaurant - Classic brunch place

8. Slate - Hands down best coffee in Seattle. Amazing places. Can't recommend enough. Get a deconstructed latte. Have your life changed.

9. Several Breweries including Peddlers and Reuben's.

Shop

1. There's a long strip here that you can just walk up and down that has many of the aforementioned food/drink places. Lots to see, only shop that sticks out is the Buffalo Exchange here. Good shit.

2. Ballard Goodwill is a bit off the path but top notch. Best in Seattle proper.

See/Do

1. Nordic Heritage Museum - Newly renovated. Incredible.

2. Golden Gardens - This is a beach close to Ballard with great views and sand if that's your thing,

3. Great Farmers Market here.



University District (U District) Obviously the University is here, didn't spend much time here but may be worth the visit if  you like to see schools. UW is beautiful this time of year with the cherry blossoms out.



Food/Drink

1. Any of the teriyaki places on ""The Ave"" which is the main drag of the U district.

2. Ivars Fish and Chips- Legendary in Seattle but honestly not that good unless you really want to, also technically not in U district

3. Slate - They opened up a place here last time I was there. Go get delicious coffee.

4. Molly Moo's - Killer Ice cream



Shop

1. Buffalo Exchange and Crossroads have incredible stuff that has been lightly worn, or in some cases never at all.

2. Some mall over by there, with Molly Moo's in it. It's okay for malls, not as good as Bellevue. 

See/Do

1. As mentioned ad nauseum, Cherry Blossoms and UW campus are very wonderful.

Capital Hill/Pike Pine: Gay district, coffee hub, nightlife

Food/Drink

1. Starbucks Reserve in Pike/Pine - Hallmark Starbucks store, I love this place, incredible to see what a big money can do in coffee. Highly recommended.

2. Victrola - Incredible coffee roaster by the Reserve

3. Analog Coffee- Second favorite coffee place in Seattle , they often get coffee from hard to reach areas like Yemen. Pastry's are solid too.

4. Rancho Bravo tacos - If you miss mexican food, I enjoy this place

5. Little Uncle- Super cute little shack thing in the Pike/Pine area, serves Thai food.

6. Terra Platta- Vegetarian place

7. Nue - Eclectic, global street food LOLZ

8. SUIKA - Japanese late night food called izakaya. Dopeness

9. Capitol Cider - Two levels of cidery! V hip



Shop

1. All the thrifts you've ever wanted. Goodwill is dope, as well as crossroads

2. Elliot Bay Company - Largest Book store in Seattle. You would love it here.

3. Next to Elliot Bay is **Totokaleo** - Best mens clothing in Seattle IMO, you can find Norse Projects, Rick, Acne, Ann, Etc

See/Do

You are smack dab in the city, nothing of pure note, but walk around. This is the most stereotypical Seattle neighborhood in the city.











Alright that's a lot and I'm not sorry. Below are a few things that didn't fit into a place but are great one off trips.



1. Alki Beach - Located in West Seattle, it is a beautiful place to watch the tide come in and out, graph some decent seafood and enjoy a sunny day (if that happens) 

2. If you want Sushi go to Musashi's. Absolutely my favorite place in Seattle. It's in a neighborhood called Wallingford which is north of Fremont.

3. The public library is downtown. close to the Art Museum and is worth a visit, if only for the architecture.

4. Please don't go to the Space Needle. Go to the Columbia Center observatory for the view. Shorter lines. Cheaper and better view.

5. Chihuly Glass museum - Most famous glass blowing artist maybe ever? Cool museum downtown and relatively close to Pike Place

Will look bad 99% of the time.
Thank you.  It's these kinds of reasonable recommendations that I come here for.  
"Sorry, vacuum pot coffee at SCW. The best!"
I‚Äôll just do that until I get roasted
"Ahhhhhh of course, I've been out of the PNW for a couple years now so it wouldn't have surprised me if they got another world class cafe"
"I am a foreigner here myself, and older than you (34), so my advice is general:

First, define what is ""pocket friendly"" for you. For instance, r/frugalmalefashion is a place I go to but most of the posts I see are for pretty expensive things that are on sale and *still* expensive. A range of what you consider acceptable would help us give advice.

Second, unless you're going to do all of your shopping online, it would also be helpful if you let us know where in the US you'll be. In my college town, almost everyone is wearing cargo shorts and Birkenstocks around campus."
Where are you going to University? Fashion tends to depend a lot on location for weather and wealth for prepiness 
"I'm a college student, and while I don't know what you want budget wise but here are some of my preferred brands:

Brooks Brothers for shirts and some sweaters

Banana republic or Ralph Lauren for chinos

LL bean for flannels. I also have a light down jacket from them that has lasted me quite a while. They also release some really nice classic sweaters during the FW season which I adore.


Lands end for assorted items such as ocbds and cheap jackets

My footwear is mostly boat shoes from Sperry in the summer and either bean boots or a pair of Allen Edmonds dress boots.

While these things may seem expensive I get almost everything during deep sales."
"Goin to GMU, VA"
"GMU, VA "
[deleted]
"That's almost the answer I was looking for man!
So, when are these sales usually? "
"I live in Virginia and let me tell you, it‚Äôs hot and humid as heck so Birkenstocks and the usual preppy style is the way to go"
"Good shit, GMU is a great school. When I was there people dressed in a pretty classic low-key college way. Sweatshirts, sweatpants, jeans, t-shirts. Go somewhere like old Navy or gap and stay away from anything graphic or with logos "
"Happen to have been there too. Penn is much preppier than GMU. In the warm months there's lots of polos, sperrys, and chino shorts. Maybe half-zips as it cools a little. In the colder months you'll see a lot of wool sweaters and Canada Goose. Obviously this is all a generalization and there's definitely diversity but if you really want to fit in with the classic Penn look you'll need deeper pockets than you would at GMU"
"There are almost always around holidays and general end of season stuff, but a good way to find them is to be on any store/brands email list and maybe follow /r/frugalmalefashion, although I don't really like the occasional impulse buy I make from there."
I don't understand PREPPY STYLE 
"Thanks for the brands man! 
BTW, I'm more of a pants - guy than a shorts guy"
[deleted]
Check Banana Republic or GAP on sale for chinos and American Eagle or Levis on sale for jeans 
"That's assuming you mean UPenn btw. If you mean one of the Penn States then I can't comment, haven't visited "

"Hi all, I‚Äôve been listening to Dead sets non-stop recently and bemoaning the fact that I can‚Äôt make a Dead & Co. show this summer, so I thought I‚Äôd put together a GD inspo album. I specifically didn‚Äôt include merch/shirts because I feel like it deserves its own category. The album mainly focuses on the 60‚Äôs and 70‚Äôs, though a few more recent pics made their way in there (such as the one of Phil Lesh and Bob Weir). It‚Äôs a fun dive into the musician fashion of the era, and it‚Äôs pretty easy to see some parallels with current trends. Anyway go look through this while listening to some Scarlet > Fire jam. ‚úåÔ∏è"
"Big fan of this album. Something a little different. 
"
Was not expecting so many polo shirts.
Rollin in the rushes down by the riverside
"this is fashion right here everyone. I love vintage grateful dead shirts... that's the shit I splurge on when I have extra money. 

also.... john mayer needs to go"
Great album! I saw Dead & Co while they were in the Bay and it was amazing. Definitely go see them at some point!
bobby loves polo shirts
Honestly his love for them is about as genuine as it gets and introducing the positivity of the Dead to a new generation is an awesome thing to do
"I've seen dead and co twice, last year, and the year before when they started. The first year I was sold and loved it and actually was really impressed with John Mayer, but then the next year the ticket prices were jacked up much higher and the show seemed phoned in to me. I miss phil."
"What are the purpose of white beaters (tanks)? Like why do people wear them underneath their shirts? It never made sense to me. Unlike a t-shirt undershirt, a wife beater has no protection for the armpits so you will sweat into your main shirt. I literally see no purpose for wife beater tanks. "
"What do you think of my outfit guys?

I have a fancy date coming up and my date will be wearing a black and white polka dot dress. Anything I can wear to match her or compliment outfit?
"Today I noticed a very well dressed man (in my unsophisticated opinion) wearing a designer backpack **covered** in MOLLE/PALS webbing.

I forget the brand: I just know it was a fashion name I would see in a nice department store rather than an outdoor store. 

Is MOLLE/PALS becoming a trend? Or **was** it a trend in recent years? I know almost nothing about fashion trends and was curious. I know plenty of military attire has gone in and out of style over the decades, but it gave me a chuckle thinking about him attaching mag and dump pouches to his business bag."
"Looking for stores that carry 5-7 inch shorts (chino shorts probably) with a little more room in the upper thigh/lower butt area. I had to size up 2 sizes for bonobos shorts to not pull across the butt/thigh which made the opening too wide.

Also looking for more short+chubby guy shirt recs. More room in the waist less in the shoulders, collared casual shirts.

"I don't know where to find classic blue jeans with that lighter wash that was common in the '90s. I can definitely find ""light wash"" jeans, but they look like they're an intentionally ""light wash."" Like [these Topman jeans](https://cdn.lookastic.com/light-blue-skinny-jeans/premium-light-wash-sunshine-blue-spray-on-skinny-jeans-original-81668.jpg) are light, but they look like a ""light wash,"" almost too light.

"Hi, so I found out about this place and I'm a bit excited and nervous about it because I've gone shopping summer clothes for the first time in quite some years. I really wanted to shake up my black and white *teenage years* closet but I'm insecure about this because I don't really have people to ask about it. First of all, I've been through some rough years and I'm veeeery skinny, like, very skinny. I'm not the only one, pretty sure, but what I mean I'd like to not look odd when it comes to my outfit. I've been used to wearing 1 size over the one I ""should"" be using(Using an S instead of an XS), but this time I decided to go and pick up what should be my size or whatever it was available under my budget, which I'll tell you about next. I don't believe this is post worthy, but I'd really appreaciate your honests opinions and suggestions, which is why I came here :)

I can't measure my chest, neck, waist etc right now, but my height is 5'9 and my weight is  around 120lbs right now. Off topic: I'm trying to gain weight, but I don't wanna force myself or I'd end up repulsing food, so I've been trying it my way by adding an extra food rich in calories every week.

Now, the pictures. I've been wearing the same shorts in every picture to make it fair, taking a look at the shoulders, sleeves, etc. I can take more pictures if requested, as I'd really appreacite the help:

1. [P&B XS Wine V-Neck](https://imgur.com/a/ZzdZsSf)
2. [Grocery store S Pinkish Red(which actually is pretty cool for its price, tbh)](https://imgur.com/a/XovlAlm)
3. [H&M Slim Fit XS Violet V-Neck; I cuffed the sleeves in the last pictures, but as you can see in the last one, when cuffed, I raise my arms and it fits oddly over the shoulders and chest area](https://imgur.com/a/H8NdlwG)
4. [H&M XS Dark blue V-Neck](https://imgur.com/a/9hH8vxx)
5. [H&M XS washed blue crewneck](https://imgur.com/a/18JqkET)
6. [H&M XS printed grey and blue; I don't know why but it feel pretty tight around the armpit, maybe because it's ""pre-cuffed"" on the sleeves. If it looks nice, I don't care tho.](https://imgur.com/a/ihXS5Nf)
7. [H&M XS red crewneck](https://imgur.com/a/Xb1DafD)

I'd say I can get 2-4 of these, budget wise(the one that costs the most is 10‚Ç¨). Point them out by the number, please. I also got myself some shorts, but I'm feeling confident on those(not only black or white haha). I'm going in vacation at the end of the weekend and I wanna return the clothes that don't fit me, so if I don't get answers, I'll have to post this tomorrow, too. Thanks! :D"

And i dont know where to even look for this kind of clothes. 

One thing is that i always liked footwear with striking colors like neon green (most of my sneakers have neon green), and now i want something even weirder, but again, i dont know any brand or place where i can find them.

"How do you guys dry your clothes? Since drying your clothing in a dryer on a hot setting shrinks them, do you size up on certain items (e.g. cotton t-shirts) knowing that they‚Äôll shrink to your preferred size later? Or do you just buy your correct size, hang dry everything and iron out/steam wrinkles before wearing them? This is probably a stupid question, but I‚Äôve bought tons of shirts that fit great then when I dry them they no longer fit well. What do you guys do?"

Looking for the midpoint between Levis 501 & 511.

On  the other hand the 511 is too tight, they fit almost like skinny jeans  on me (but they're marketed as slim fit?). However I do like the rise of  the 511 and the taper of the hem.

If  someone could recommend some Levis models to try on that sit somewhere  between the 501 and the 511 that would be much be much appreciated. I suppose I'm  looking for something like the 511 but with a bit more room, but not  quite so baggy like the 501.

"Dear owners of a one piece collar dress shirt,

I recently stumbled upon a creation in the world of dress shirts, that is a one piece collar or 'Cooper' collar. This type of dress shirt is known for its unique collar structure, which is made up of (as the name suggests) one piece of fabric. The first thought that occurred to me is that this is probably your best option when it comes to dress shirts that are worn without a tie, due to the fact that the collar maintains its curvature throughout the day without fatigue. However,....

I wanted to ask this subreddit, in particular the owners of such a shirt, how well these marvels of the satorial world age. I can imagine that after multiple washings or wrongfully ironing such a delicate structure may result in a deterrence of the estetic or integrity of the collar.

I would like to hear your thoughts on this type of dress shirt with the emphasise on the aging of the garment. Ideally, you may support your view with photographic support."

"I think it looks good sometimes, but personally, I've got a bit of a peeve with it, that being that, especially for shorter dudes, while tucking in the front makes your legs look longer and thus you look taller, it makes the sides and back look extra long relatively, so from any angle other than the front, you look shorter. I'd go with a full tuck, or, which is my favorite, tuck in a tee shirt completely and then leave an unbuttoned shirt on top, untucked, to kind of mix up the proportions, while keeping the appearance of longer legs."

"Black leather somethingorother

Idk, I agree that you want to do something SLP-ish. (Saint Laurent Paris).

I feel like it could also work with a black harrington, maybe."
Varsity jacket would be my go-to. Just search SLP jacket on Google for some inspo
"For me, SLP is about interesting textures on outerwear. It's a combination of romantic, western, and luxury. Suede leather or velvet/velveteen are both really good for this look because they're both luxe textures. They look soft and welcoming to touch, and it's a bit of a play on highlighting masculinity by wearing something feminine. Huge fur jacket would also be applicable here.

It wouldn't really be a problem to wear an assymetrical style jacket like the schott perfecto, because it's ingrained as a rock star jacket - again romantic and luxe, but in a more masculine way. Alternative is the denim jacket which still has the western workwear kind of vibe.

A blazer with pushed up sleeves could also work.."
The outfit you have here looks like a summer outfit to me. Unsure if you'd be wearing a short sleeve button down with light wash jeans in the fall. 
"I like the shirt, got a link?"

"I only use my BT rig a few times a year but mine is OTR from Jos A Bank - and tailored.  But it's a fraction of your budget.  For MTM Kent Wang may be an option, I'm pretty sure he offers black tie."
"Honestly, it won't even eat up all of your budget, but SuitSupply does really nice tuxedos/eveningwear. I've got a tux that I really love, and they have a large selection of additional dinner jackets/smoking jackets. If you really wanted to, and think you could still wear them, you could get a regular black tux and then also a nice dinner jacket, there's a gorgeous navy double breasted jacket that I'm considering. This way you could spruce up black tie and eveningwear and stand out a little. Idk, up to you, but I'd definitely recommend SuitSupply."

"My own preference (ordered) for summer wear and for fit: 5, 1, 4, and either 2 or 6. That's just my opinion, maybe you'll get different feedback.

"Google ""TM Lewin"" and then click on the Charles Tyrwhitt ad link to buy CT dress shirts for, like, $35 each. CT has shirts that meet those specs. "
"Browse Charles Tyrwhitt, use their introductory offer to nab three shirts for $90 and free shipping/exchange to determine your best fit (and/or separately take advantage of their current end-of-season sale).

CT has a 'classic fit' and the CT 'slim fit' isn't particularly slim, more for athletic and built types (the 'extra slim' is for slim but fit types while the 'super slim' is for skinny bois)."
"If you're pairing the jeans with a 'business' shirt, it'll be apparent you're wearing denim."
Yes and no.  With an untucked shirt or t shirt or something they‚Äôre pretty much interchangeable but tucking in a poplin shirt probably won‚Äôt be ideal.
"An overcoat, single-breasted and longer (hits right above knee). A car coat, single-breasted and mid-length (at thigh, in-between peacoat and overcoat). Or you can layer a down gilet/vest beneath a lighter jacket/parka.

With regard to warmth / functionality, that all depends on the material used in the coat (the type of wool, the weight of the fabric, the coat lining). Personally, I wear a peacoat made with 32 oz melton wool, so very toasty, but not ideal when wearing a blazer. If I wore suits more often, I would probably opt for a longer coat."
"Something like a car coat is typically similar weight/versatility, but I wouldn't say it's a radically different look."
"Depends on your location / winter weather I would say. The last few years I've been wearing the same black down jacket in the winter.

A little hard to tell with the low resolution but it looks informal enough to pass as a sports jacket imo. 
Shoulders are too structured.

"I liked that, but it's been way overdone and we're all super over it. I'd suggest don't do that anymore. I got pissed at Ami's stylist who did that at PFW a few weeks ago, it doesn't look good anymore imo. Two things to consider for shirts: First of all, cropped body, second of all, open, with a tee shirt underneath, tucked in. Another way you could do it for that more relaxed SOuth-of-France-esque vibe is only button 2 or 3 of the middle buttons, leave the bottom open and the top one or two open. But don't do the partial tuck."
"I would recommend you not to wear a double üçû ed structured blazer like that casually.

That is obviously a photoshoot with an attractive model. Most people in a normal setting would look silly.

If you're looking to wear a suit casually I would do a search on here for 'casual blazer guide'."
"I wear similar fits for work. You could try rolling up your jeans a bit to show more of the boots.

If you need more inspo check the Workwear/Americana albums in the sub, they may be your style. "
"Not in love with that jacket, but other than that you look fine. Also you do you."
Thats one bright tie! I think grey suit is best. I would go for a plain or maybe lightly checkered shirt. Lavender colour could be good because then tie wouldnt look so bright.

Fits are trending back to wider leg straight fits. You may want to leave them as is
"Tapering is a fairly basic alteration that any competent tailor can pull off. The challenge is simply finding one if you're not already familiar with who's around your city.

Turns out, the shoes are almost perfect for me in this size. There is some extra room in the left boot that I could do without, but I don't think I'd have gone for a 10.5 to be honest.

Also, what's kinda funny is that the shoes are literally made in india.

Also, if this is your first boot, keep in mind that itll take 2-3 wears for the boot to not be down right painful. After that, it'll only get more comfortable. After around a week of around 5 wears, I was almost at the comfort level of my cheap puma running shoes. "

"I've tried them on in-store. They're a bit slimmer than brands like Uniqlo and Bella + Canvas. Yes, they're nice."
"Color will be subjective, but a grenadine if you're looking at a solid would be a nice contrast with the plain suit.  Silver is traditional, or a [wedding check](http://www.kentwang.com/ties/glen-plaid.html).

Pretty much anything will work with the navy suit and white shirt, but darker colors will be more formal."
"Bought a tie from The Knottery a few years ago for a fall wedding. Absolutely loved it. Agreed with /u/TonyStarchimedes, try getting a Grenadine tie. Your tie is your chance to shine, so pick something substantial that you will like.

Btw, these might be pricey to you, but it's just a different recommendation for a store. There are plenty cheaper options out there, it's up to you to find the one in your budget that fits you best."

Any of those jeans and chinos will work and most of the shoes you mentioned. 
"Looks like it fits pretty well overall.  Are you standing more upright than you normally do in the pictures?  If so, that might be causing the wrinkling I'm seeing in the back of the jacket.  I'd look for jackets with a lower buttoning point in the future - hard to avoid if that's how SS cuts everything though.

Slightly less leg taper could help with the drape of the pants."
How was your experience with Suit Supply? I'm thinking of taking the plunge but hesitant since it's done online.

"Cold soaking raw denim (45 min to an hour in a tub, no detergent) can get out any starch that's been applied and soften it up for the next wear, but doing so takes away how pronounced the crease points (and therefore the contrast fading at the creases) will be, if that matters to you at all."

Aside from that, a damp cloth should be sufficient as /u/Smilotron said. What shoes are they?"

Are you going to get measured in person?"
"I would much rather dress smart casual than in a suit. 

I find OCBDs much more comfortable than a dress shirt, for one. I can also wear chinos/wool non-dress pants. No need for a blazer with smart casual. I can wear boots and derbys rather than dress shoes. I can wear a smart watch rather than a dress watch.

Generally smart-casual is just comfier than a suit. Arguably you could wear a more casual suit that's not as structured and made from softer, stretchier material."
Suits get hot and expensive (dry clean only). In the summer they can get pretty hot. In a smart casual environment you might stand out a bit in a bad way.
"If you want to try more interesting pieces but don't want to break the bank, try fast-fashion brands like Zara and Forever 21. "
"If it‚Äôs a tall boot they can help maintain the shape of the shaft, but a regular shoe tree is like 90% as effective in my experience.  "
I've used regular shoe trees in my boots for years now and they do their job just fine. I think the main purpose of the tree is to remove some odor and keep the toebox up. The boot shaft is less prone to losing it's structure than the toebox.

"I mean, it's not *not* okay to wear, but it's a little funny... I'll agree that solid navy/charcoal would be better.

So I know J Crew designed the Crosby suit specifically to be a more athletic version of the Ludlow suit. I would ask them about that specific suit and if you can try it in a color that might match well. Also I know Ralph Lauren suits can often have some more work done internally that helps with larger thighs. Brooks Brothers also has what I would consider to be a rather forgiving fit as try their Regent fit trousers or their Fitzgerald (slightly slimmer than Regent). Best of luck!"
"As he mentioned, Brooks Brothers is good, I'd also try SuitSupply. Couldn't tell you exactly the names of models, but they have some wider leg trousers, and you can always size up so that the thigh is wider and then just have a tailor bring in the waist and length."
"Looks good, and yes, it would."
"Great suit huge fan of SuitSupply made a couple videos on their suits. Good balance of affordable and quality black will almost always work with what you're wearing. You could also rock some light brown double monks if you want. I might stick with a solid shoe though instead of something patterned like a wingtip, just personal preference. When there's already a pattern or texture added into the suit I'm wearing I like to balance it our with a clean solid color shoe. Hope you enjoy the suit!"

"I hang dry all shirts and iron button ups. tshirts i just fold and hope for the best. At minimum, I would hang dry button ups since the drier breaks down clothes quickly"
"I use a dryer for regular cotton tees, hoodies, and simple pants like chinos and some jeans. After the first wash (assuming they're not already pre-shrunk), they shouldn't really shrink all that much. Button up shirts I always hang dry, as well as anything else that's not really cotton, such as linen, polyester blends, anything with elastane, viscose rayon and silk shirts, wool, etc... And finally, I usually use a medium heat instead of high heat, it gets the job done as long as you didn't fill the dryer too full. "

"I'm a university student myself, but near the end of my studies. That means I've been at a stable enough weight and size to purchase my first leather jacket.

As the other guy has said, there isn't a right answer. But personally, I just wouldn't buy one. 90% of the appeal in a leather jacket is the fit. The other 10% is how the jacket looks itself. A cheap jacket will almost always be a poor fit, and look very cheap.

I'd say save your money for now, and wait until you've enter a sustainable weight. In the meantime, try on ever jacket you can when you're out shopping. If you know you're gonna go to a shopping centre with leather jackets, wear an outfit you'd wear if you owned one and try it out. Not only will you get an idea on how they look on you, but you'll also get a sense for the style you're looking for."

"I vote zip up because they're easier to put on and take off, and easier to style (unzip to show off t-shirt)."
"I prefer pullover and here's why: Zip ups, unless perfectly cut, have a weird way of looking kind of slouchy. If they're unzipped, the front bits hang looser than the back, and look weird imo. And when they're zipped up, they have a tendency to do that wavy thing with the zipper. You know what I mean. Pullovers don't have that."

You make it sound like he's gonna die of old age, lol (but he'll be fine).

Keep the add-ons simple and to a minimum, if your fianc√©'s lifestyle and career don't call for additional clothes then don't buy him clothes he might never wear. It sounds like he has a mix of Americana and punk styles. I'd look into a couple pairs of chinos in earth tones (khaki/beige and drab olive) or chambray pants and a few button-down collar shirts to start, and see he how he feels about it. You may want to consider reading up a bit on shirting fabrics so you choose something that's appropriate for your weather/climate and your fianc√©'s comfort. A plain or simple check pattern button-down shirt and a pair of chinos are an easy way for him to 'spruce up' for a night out while also allowing for mix-and-matching with the clothes he already has.

Are you in the U.S.? Browse Uniqlo, J.Crew and Charles Tyrwhitt sales for a mix of things. I'm not sure what your standard for upscale is, but these are better quality-wise than fast fashion like H&M and Zara and sale pricing gets you really good bang for your buck."

"I don't constantly wear suits considering I'm in college right now, but I have for interviews and my internship and eventually I will have to wear them nonstop due to the practice I want to get into later on in life, so I like to think I know my suit game a bit. 

You definitely need to get it tailored at the very least. Non tailored suits are a nightmare to move around with and they just look horrible. If the suit you currently have is physically hurting you, I'd suggest getting a new suit entirely that correctly fits your dimensions. Or you could get the suit you have tailored or altered, it's up to you. The sizing, of course this depends on what kind of fit you want, extreme, portly, modern etc. 

You could head to a local tailor shop and get their expert opinion on the state of your suit, I'd suggest this first and foremost to see if it is a problem with the suit or some other problem like posture or stature.

New tailored suits can vary depending on the type, fit, style. The basic suit retailers vary in their products, Jos A. Bank tailored suits go from around $700-$1000, with a few below that. Men's Warehouse is consistently around $700-$1000 for the good ones. Bonobos go for a bit less than Men's Wearhouse and Jos a Bank, around $550-$1000. The cut off high point for price is usually around a $1000. There are some other designer suits that go for much, much more, but if you want a decent and are willing to go full brand retail, dropping $700-$1000 is the best for a decent look from these retailers.

If you want something cheaper and a bit more personal you can check out made to measure shops like [Tailor Store](https://www.tailorstore.com/mens-custom-tailored-suits) or some place like [INDOCHINO](https://www.tailorstore.com/mens-custom-tailored-suits) which can get as low as $250-$350 for tailored suits. 

I personally got my only suit for my high school Prom around 4 years ago from Men's Warehouse. In total it was around $1000 because it's a pretty high class suit, and I'm still using it today, but there are definitely options if you want a cheaper, more ergonomic fit. "
A suit should not hurt you. Go to a good men's shop. Many people here swear by Suitsupply. I like Spier and Mackay but unless you are in the Toronto area they're mail order only. I would avoid Men's Wearhouse and Joseph A Bank. They're overpriced unless they are on deep discount and the staff is generally not that knowledgeable. Your best ally is a good tailor. He or she might be able to tell you what's wrong with your current suit. 
Probably best to define moderate to affordable price
"Idk about quality, but I‚Äôve recently found https://shop.mango.com just bought some pants and jacket, so we will see.

I don't even see why you shouldn't mix Nike and Adidas. I'm not in a exclusive brand deal. They don't have advertising rights over my whole body just because I'm wearing one piece. I feel like doing it more now just to piss off the haters. 
Uniqlo is a good start
"* Uniqlo - Basically everything they sell is at least decent.
* American Eagle - Their extreme flex jeans, specifically (wait for a sale, which happens quite often).
* Abercrombie - Shorts and button down shirt are good for the price.  They have sales frequently.
* H&M - I like their zippered hoodies.  Their other clothes vary in quality, so you're going to have to hunt around to see something that you like that's well made.
* Zara's - Same thing as H&M; you'll have to hunt around to see something that you like that's well made.
* J. Crew Factory - Shorts, chinos, and button down shirts are nice when on sale.  Stay away from any of their Mercantile shirts.
* Levi's - Either wait for a big sale on their jeans or buy them on sale at department stores like Macy's."

"I have not looked at Jos A Bank yet but I definitely will!  I will take a look at Kent Wang; for some reason when I last did, I missed the tuxedo option(s) but, back then, I was predominantly looking at suits anyway.

I know my budget is pretty high.  Honestly, I had saved two budgets: one for these events coming up and then my brother's wedding.  He ended up going much more formal than originally planned so I just combined them to see what I could get.  "
I took a look at SuitSupply.  I like what they have but I asked anyway in case people had other suggestions!

"ok, let me rephrase my question. Which one is looks better and creates sense of richness?  "
"Thank you for the answers :) What's your take on V-necks? I've mostly read about how skinny guys should not be wearing those because of the collarbones, chest, etc. I honestly don't know if a crewneck would be helping with that. Overall, I'd say almost every t-shirt is pretty comfy, except 6 and probably 3, which feel a bit tight around the armpits and sides.

I'm trying to not forcing myself, but I'd be lying if I said opinions have not motivated me over the years on gaining weight along with my own self esteem. I'm conscious that I might be looking better by gaining a few pounds, but I don't think I should be waiting until then to get me some new clothes."
Really appreciate the help ended up doing the three for $90
"Cool, thanks so much. I'm unsure which one I'm going to lean towards but these are some good options. I think overcoats are cool but currently I wear casual outfits.

"I may not have explained well. The top part of my thighs, where it meets my hip, is pretty dang thick. It tapers off a bit towards my knee. My calves muscles are pretty thick too, but my ankle ankles isn't really. So what will happen, mostly with jeans, is that it's tight around my thighs, somewhat looser around my knee, tight around my calf, and then loose around my ankle. 

Unless it's slim or skinny fit jeans, in which case I often just can't pull them up all the way because they can't fit over my calf/thigh. "

"> The things we buy don‚Äôt just magically appear. They are the product of massive global supply chains that involve countless people, places, and facilities. A pair of jeans might have its cotton grown in the United States, spun and woven into denim in Turkey, cut and sewn in Bangladesh, washed and finished in China, and then sold in the U.K.

> In most cases, all we get as consumers is a single country of origin (in the above case, it would be Bangladesh) and the fiber content (cotton, elastane, polyester, etc.).

> How are we supposed to know what we buy doesn‚Äôt come from a factory with unsafe working conditions, child or forced labor, or that pays an unlivable wage with such scant information? The supply chain could span half a dozen countries, with a half dozen different sets of labor laws, so it‚Äôs nearly impossible to figure out what exactly lead to the creation of nearly anything mass produced. There is a skull-crushing amount of information about the sourcing and production of everything as simple as a toothpick to as complex as the phone or computer you‚Äôre currently reading.

"There was an interesting discussion in a business ethics class I took on the morality of sweatshops and (perhaps surprisingly) the answer is not as straightforward as ""sweatshops are bad"" or corporate greed. Paradoxically, if western consumers were to somehow completely stop purchasing sweatshop goods, the workers would likely be worse off. Articles such as these only scratch at the surface of the issue, and the ""ideal factory"" described is largely meaningless, as it would be basically impossible to establish in regions referred to (Bangladesh, Cambodia, etc.) under current conditions.

The abundance of sweatshops in developing countries indicates a demand for low skill economic opportunity. Work opportunities in these regions are vastly more limited than in the west, and sweatshops often serve as the only alternative to starvation or death. Even when alternatives exist, they may be just as bad or worse for the worker. Waste picking is an example (https://youtu.be/O2_Ts63fVoc?t=28s). A popular notion is that workers always have the option of subsistence agriculture, but rural farmers commonly move into the city deliberately to pursue sweatshop labor despite the low pay and grueling work, presumably because it's marginally better than farming. Furthermore a large percentage of workers are landless and do not have this choice in the first place.

Obviously forced labor and hazardous working conditions are violations to human rights and can *never* be encouraged. However, the harsh reality is that poverty is a multifaceted issue with no simple immediate solution. Boycotting sweatshop labor or imposing trade sanctions may close down the factories, but is not necessarily ethical when there are no alternative sources of income. Without understanding acceptable limits to the cost of pursuing economic progress, moral outrage at sweatshop labour is largely unfounded.

There's more depth to this issue including rights to self-determination and US-Asia political relations which you can read about [here](http://www.globalethicsnetwork.org/profiles/blogs/two-faces-of-economic-development-the-ethical-controversy), but the general conclusion is that the goal of eliminating sweatshops cannot be reached unless the underlying systemic conditions which cause them to exist are addressed, which boycotting essentially does not. Economic change *is* possible through smart and focused political action, but positive changes could take decades to come into being. At the end of the day, when considering the interests of the individual sweatshop worker as a consumer, the act of purchasing a sweatshop good is morally ambiguous."
Don't do me like that fam
"It's totally reasonable to hate both the player and the game. Capitalists make capitalism, some of these companies could do a little to lead on these issues, including but not limited to *slavery*, but choose not to. The game is capitalism, yes, but the players have names and addresses."
"Exactly. A story that really resonates with me from the Grapes of Wrath is this guy trying to find who's responsible for taking his house. He keeps on going up and up the chain but everyone's replaceable, so he says ""well who do I shoot? It'd a man made disaster it's gotta be someone responsible""

But it's not clear whether anyone's responsible at all. Is it the system? What exactly is that corporation? That bank?"
"Thanks for beating me to this :) Of course all of the worker protections mentioned in this article are good compared to the extremes of worker exploitation, but I also can't help but roll my eyes at the idea that the basic protections they're describing constitute ""the ideal factory.""

The *ideal factory* isn't one that just ""pays a fair wage"" -- it's one that's owned by the workers."
"It is brutal that not everyone can have the working conditions that we do (yet), but it is also immoral to take that choice away from sweatshop workers. After all, in many regions the alternative is starving in a paddy field."
"r/advancedcapitalism

Fashion is where the fruits of capitalism are flaunted. As someone working in the industry and putting up with huge egos this is conflicting. "
"It should also be stated that the workers in these factories are there because they want that job.  If life had a better option, they would likely change jobs.  That's what drives up wages--when people are given an option.  For many of these people, backbreaking farming is the other option and they choose to work in a factory."
That‚Äôs a whole other article. 
Solving problems is hard :(
"This article is basically doing nothing but advocating that we stop doing business with poor countries, because they're too poor. Kick 'em while they're down. "
Vechain can trace the origin of a product but says nothing about the conditions in which it is made. I'm not totally sure how it helps here..
"It‚Äôs not like shutting down the factories is the only way to deal with this issue. Companies could enforce stricter standards for working environments, and increase pay to a livable wage. People want cheap clothes, and it‚Äôs not like HM is suddenly going to produce in Belgium instead. Companies are already making massive profits from cheap labour and if they want to keep the same profits they could pass on the extra cost to the consumer.

Of course this would have to be enforced at a governmental level or else another company not concerned with ethics would just take their place. 

Although I do concede that my scenario is just as improbable as if everyone just suddenly switched to slow fashion."
"I agree with much of this. But without boycotts or moral outrage, there will be little incentive for bad actors (merchants or factory owners) to change. If the merchants (the people deciding which factory gets the work) feel some moral obligation to their consumer, they may make more responsible choices. The factories in developing countries that do their best to create a 'better' work environment, should the be factories getting the work. "
"I agree with all of the statements of fact in your post. 

However, I also believe it is immoral to benefit from slavery and coercion. To that end, I believe we should establish systems to vet the supply chains for our goods, and we should ban the import of goods tainted in this way.

Many citizens don't care, or don't want to care about these things. Like pollution, waste, and other bad behaviors, I believe we should use the force of law to make sure that everybody *must* comply with these systems.

Slavery is a a sin against mankind that harms everyone in a material way. As long as slavery is practiced, the value of low-skill labor will be suppressed by immoral forces. Free Mexican clothes manufacturers should not have to compete with child labor and slaves in Bangladesh and India.

In my ideal scenario, and international organization would audit plants, farms, ranches, and factories, and products from those factories would be issued a cryptographically traceable mark using a blockchain system. In order to cross into wealthy countries like the United States, the UK, and the EU, products would need to have a complete cryptographic profile. This system is not perfect, but it would help cut down on the liquidity of products produced using immoral and unethical methods."
"The act of purchasing isn‚Äôt and shouldn‚Äôt be a moral decision  consumption itself isn‚Äôt a choice, we need anything that we can‚Äôt make ourselves. Its a privilege for most of us who are able to make choices when it comes to consumption, but it shouldn‚Äôt be our responsibility to learn everything about how a product is made and investigate the entire international supply chain to ensure ethical consumption. For these reasons I agree that boycotting sweatshops isn‚Äôt a good way to combat the issue. But I also don‚Äôt think the local economics of the issue that you mentioned make it anymore complicated. No matter the circumstances, these people should have safe working conditions, good pay, and most importantly the ability to organize. That is really the only discussion we should be having. We don‚Äôt need to be concerned about which company choose what factories and where and what labor practices are used if we know that theres a standard for ethical production and is able to be enforced. We shouldn‚Äôt be concerned with ethical consumption, we should be concerned with ethical production. "
"This is why I hate corporate PR with passion. There's no such thing as ""the man responsible"" like in hollywood movies. Apple can fuck up in colossal proportions, like the current keyboard issue, but you can't attack Tim Cook, or pinpoint anyone to attack, it's ""Apple's fault"" and everyone in Apple goes scott free. Someone should be held responsible, but everyone gets protected under ""everyone did it"""
So what you're saying is that the only way we can help those workers is we also help ourselves? 
"I agree with this for the most part, but the picture is more complicated.  There are definitely some people who are coerced into working at factories; some of the situations are acceptable (harsh family medical conditions, etc), some of which aren't (making your kid work in harsh conditions because you dont want to do anything).  Most situations fall in between somewhere.

On top of that, there is a degree of cultural appropriateness.  What is normal and humane in the western world is a wasteful luxury in another; values aren't uniform, and going about enforcing a willy-nilly ""this isn't right"" does quite a bit of harm, even if well intentioned.  

Its honestly a hard discussion to have without knowing how global supply chains generally work, and the nature of global commerce.  "
"Thats awfully selfish. Then those poor countries would have absolutely no form of economy and the people who work at these factories cant put food on their families tables. Sadly this typa shit is some of these people‚Äôs source of income. If we boycott them they die of starvation, our clothing prices go up, and the governments wont give 2 shits. This is a hard topic man."
"I don't think it's necessarily advocating that. Developing nations would raise their standards to access wealthy markets. It would have costs though, and likely some of those costs would affect poor workers there. You'd likely end up with fewer workers who work in better conditions."
"Well, you know all of those job killing regulations that republicans like to talk about and trade agreements that the current administration has been shutting down and backing us out of?    That's how.    

By making agreements and performing inspections to confirm compliance.    If you have inspected a factory and confirmed requirements and processing then traceability to that factory becomes possible.    Sure stuff could just be moved through that factory but a factory has a known quantity of output.  They wouldnt be able to move more than that through the factory without arousing suspicions.        

Removing regulations is about nothing more than removing the requirements for reporting and inspection in an effort to avoid the possibility of suspicions being raised. "
"I was going to type the same thing.  I will note that its totally possible to use blockchain as an auditing tool, but that will take some real world class math wizardry and a really hardcore, in depth understanding of auditing supply chains that very few people/firms possess simultaneously.  "
"I agree this is a significant aspect of ethics in a capitalist society! Everyone is ""just doing their job,"" even when that job has monstrous and inhumane consequences, people will always deflect and say the responsibility is diffuse, ultimately falling onto some abstract notion of ""the market.""

And individuals who do find things objectionable on a moral level can find it very difficult to speak or act out, because if they do, their livelihoods are at risk, and thus their housing, healthcare, etc. Which is why the very first step to a more moral society is decommodifying the basic needs of living, e.g. guaranteed healthcare, housing, and education."
"To be fair, it's also very very complicated. "
"Not at all.

My point is sweat shops are, for now, a necessary evil. We should pressure for higher standards by avoiding the absolute worst offenders, encouraging them to do better. 

However, a blanket boycott of the practise is not good for anyone. Workers in places like China and Bangladesh rely on the wages they earn through this work, however small. We have to let them go through this process like the developed world did, or else the other option as I said is to go back to working in fields and suffering from widespread starvation. 

By the way, I don't mean to be rude or anything, but ""what you're saying is"" is hardly ever an appropriate thing to say. It is almost always a set up for an argument you would like to respond to, not what the argument the person actually made.

This is why you have Dickies switching manufacturers every other month or so and why the pants fall apart in 2 weeks."
"Right, but this means that the solution here is regulation, not blockchain. vechain might be good for tracing the product to a regulated factory, but it's not the actual solution to poor working conditions. I think sometimes we get over excited about a blockchain play thinking it will solve a bunch of problems but forget that the data stored on blockchain has to come from somewhere"
"'What you're saying is' can set up a strawman, and it can also provide a pointed summary of what was said. It's no more cheap or mischaracterising as an approach as any other way of reducing another person's statement.

In this case it is an effective characterisation of what you argued. You confirm this in your first real sentence: 'sweat shops are, for now, a necessary evil'. And further by stating that 'we have to let them go through this process like the developed world did'.

In fact, it's *not* a necessary evil (it's not necessary at all); and we *don't* need to let the same process transpire (we don't need a rising tide to lift all boats).

Specifically, the argument you're making is the same one that is used most often to defend globalisation's serious downside. E.g. 'Sweat shops are good because the alternative is starvation'. Which sets up an all-or-nothing false dichotomy between how things work right now, and withdrawing from the system altogether. 

Conversely, these are not the only two options. There is at least a third way: there exists enough money in the world *right now* to fix humanity's scarcity problems directly. Famine, poverty, and low QoL could be immediately remedied by the developed world committing to develop the developing world on a global scale. 'We' go in, we build houses, schools, hospitals, infrastructure, we set up businesses through FDI, we provide food, and even money, if necessary, to bridge the gap between their standard of living and ours. 

The thing is that we get nothing out of it in the near term. In fact it costs us money (assuming you hold on to the myth that money is scarce). And more importantly, the people on the receiving end will have done nothing at all to earn it. Which I would argue is the real gotcha as to why it's not being done. 

So the answer to my question is YES. We will not really help others unless it also helps us. The obverse point is that those people being helped aren't actually being helped: they're earning their way out (through suffering). And we aren't helping them: we are investing in them, and we get a return in the form of low product prices in the market.

Thus, it only seems like a 'necessary evil' if you have accepted (maybe without even realising it) the supremacy of market ideology (the oft-referred 'neoliberalism') as a prerequisite. We don't have to do so, and such is a relatively new economic development (since 1980s) with very serious downsides. "
"It would affect both. I mean this is kind of like the minimum wage debate and has similar tradeoffs. I support minimum wage regulations and trade regulations that require regulations identical to ours, but I understand there are some negative effects. I do think on balance this would be a positive change."
"Yes do agree with you that the solution for bettering poor working conditions is regulation.  But I believe there is still a blockchain tie in here in that it would allow for traceability all the way back to a specific facility that is covered by those regulations.    And on the other end of the supply chain such traceability would enable additional regulation requiring sales of product produced under key regulations.   Right now that is a herculean task if not an impossible one because paper work gets forged, shipments get mixed in with each other, all sorts of things, etc.     The blockchain will enable easily validated and verifiable end to end regulation on production, transport, distribution, and end sales.     It makes trust but verify easier."
"You have absolutely mischaracterised my statement in order to create an argument you can take cheaper shots at. You are trying to turn a nuanced argument into a blanket statement, so that you can make your square peg fit into a round hole. 

It is true, we do not need to let the exact same process transpire. Since we have learned from mistakes and now hold human wellbeing to a higher standard, we can make moral consumer decisions which influence big corporations into using sweatshops at increasingly higher standards. 

It isn't all or nothing, and it isn't a false dichotomy. 

You argue that there is a third way, but it is firmly rooted in idealism and not based in reality. There is only a third way if it is realistic, which it isn't. 

I could say, for example, ""no no there is a third option. If we increasingly develop artificial intelligence to the point that none of us have to work, then there wouldn't be sweatshops anymore."" Yes, this is technically true, but is it practical in a realistic environment? Absolutely not, it is a fairytale, just as your radical redistribution of wealth is. 

You seem to have a problem with capitalism, but that isn't going anywhere quickly, and can do nothing for sweatshop workers in the short-term. We can only work with the tools we have got. 

You are letting perfect get in the way of good. Idealism is getting in the way of progress. It is completely and utterly immoral to take the choice of working through suffering to keep yourself alive, to abandoning sweatshops altogether and removing a method of making a living for hundreds of communities who, only a generation or two ago, would suffer all day with the added risk of dying from starvation and disease. 

It is not out place to sit in a rich and privileged society and take away the choices, and agency, of people from poorer nations in more desperate situations. What we can do is boycott the worst offenders, companies like Nike, and demand that situations improve. 

It has nothing to do with helping ourselves, it is about not pulling the blanket from underneath a group of people whose lives are on a knife's edge. It is about teasing it out, gradually, just as it has been done in our own society. 






"
">Conversely, these are not the only two options. There is at least a third way: there exists enough money in the world \*right now\* to fix humanity's scarcity problems directly. Famine, poverty, and low QoL could be immediately remedied by the developed world committing to develop the developing world on a global scale. 'We' go in, we build houses, schools, hospitals, infrastructure, we set up businesses through FDI, we provide food, and even money, if necessary, to bridge the gap between their standard of living and ours.

  


It's more complicated than that. You not only need the money, but you also need to know where and how to allocate your resources. Those countries have no institutions capable of doing anything like that (they can't even do it at a regional level), so we're left with applying some weird *benevolent neo-imperialism*. There's no real way to do that."
"I would invite you to show me where, anywhere at all, I mischaracterised your statements. I haven't.

Let me provide you some specifics. 

First, you said it's 'necessary', and I said 'it's not'. Then you said 'we have to let the process [transpire]', and I said 'we do not'. This is directly addressing the point.

Second, in saying 'it's necessary' and 'we have to let the process [transpire]' you are inherently creating a dichotomy: in using the word necessary and in arguing that this is the only choice (practical or otherwise) you're intrinsically arguing that there are no other options. That is true by definition: one option cannot be necessary if there are other options. And as to valid options being key (e.g. practical), you agreed with me that it was possible, and thus that my 3rd way is valid. 

Thus I find it really ironic that you made a point in your reply to highlight what you consider to be poor form and to accuse me of more or less strawmanning your argument, while in reality using this as a tactic (mot-and-bailey) to defend a point that has become indefensible for you. Worse, you're committing the same hypocrisy you accuse me of: 'you seem to have a problem with capitalism' and thereby to create a strawman where it's easier to defend anti-capitalist arguments than the one I actually made. 

In reality I said nothing at all about Capitalism. I never used the word. And nothing about my third option of 'go to x country and fix it' implies that Capitalism has to be repealed. If it is desirable in fact to keep Capitalism, there is an entire movement Effective Altruism designed to do just that. And in turn if it is desirable not to keep Capitalism, it is possible to design and implement a new economic system, based on the successes of the current system, without reverting to previous models that have been tried and failed. It's not 'Capitalism vs Communism'. The 20th Century is over. No need to repeat it.

Finally, let's deal with the argument you backpeddled to: idealism, perfect vs good, and incremental change. And here my argument continues to hold. All the options you suggest we not do (abandoning sweatshops en masse) are characterised fairly as all-or-nothing (we can either have sweatshops or no sweatshops, and people starve). And the option you suggest we do (allowing sweatshops to continue) has a direct consequences of enriching us, even if you wanted to argue that it's unintended. 

In fact, the cynic in me is a bit irritated that you want me to buy the idea that, in fact, we're operating the system *for the benefit of* the developing world, that this is good for them, and thus that anyone who wants to change it is actively *harming* them. I guess it just so happens to be a coincidence that our modern economic system and its growth are staked on the reduction in consumer prices that their cheap labour provides. 

You also kind of ignore the fact that when country X becomes 'non-competitive' (e.g. China very shortly) companies actually abandon them for some other cheaper labour pool. That's deliberate: consumer prices are only kept low if labour prices are also kept low. It's always a race to the cheapest labour. That's a feature and not a bug.

But in any case I don't need grand arguments for 'Capitalism is better than the alternative'. Despite the strawman, I'm not pushing Communism. It's perfectly possible for society(ies) to decide to help others without needing a profit motive. How you would want to carry this out is arguable, and at what level(s) are flexible. My point continues to be that there only seems like no other way when you already believe that there is no other way. "
"In ""Why Economists are Wrong about Sweatshops and the Antisweatshop Movement,"" the writer speaks about the choice of working in a sweatshop: ""This is not meant to suggest that these exchanges between employers and poor workers with few alternatives are in reality voluntary or that world export factory jobs are not sweatshops or places of exploitation. Rather, as political philosopher Michael Waltzer argues, these exchanges should be seen as ""trades of last resort"" or ""desperate"" exchanges that need to be protected by labor legislation regulating such things as limits on hours, a wage floor, and guaranteed health and safety requirements.""

So yes, although sweatshop wages are usually higher than the national average and can serve as a way out of poverty, there are things that we can do to help workers. I have written on and researched the topic previously and suggested consumers can support brands 'in the middle."" Purchasing from companies that manufacture in developing countries with self-imposed safeguards can grow their business model and encourage other brands to take part."
"It's not more complicated than that. The problem isn't intractable. 

Where countries or societies have incapable institutions, you don't hand over your cash to them. The idea is specifically to put the money into the hands of the organsisations who are most effective with it. And those organisations, who are on the front lines, know where exactly the money ought to go.

Neither is it 'neo-imperialism' (which is really laughable as an application). It's Effective Altruism. And since it involves individuals, organisations, and even govts, handing over their cash voluntarily, standards can be set as to what impact is expected. A programme can be monitored, adjusted, and if necessary, terminated. It doesn't have to involve govts directly, and it can be done cooperatively. 

In a situation where a govt is actively opposed to the assistance either altogether or in part, then this is respected. Nothing is imposed, it's offered for the good of humanity without strings attached (other than not being misappropriated)."
">The idea is specifically to put the money into the hands of the organsisations who are most effective with it.

Which organizations? How do you know they are the most effective? 

>And those organisations, who are on the front lines, know where exactly the money ought to go.

How do you know they *know where exactly the money ought to go*? 

>And since it involves individuals, organisations, and even govts, handing over their cash voluntarily, standards can be set as to what impact is expected. 

Handing over their cash voluntarily. But you also say governments. They get money from taxes. So people are not going to hand their cash over voluntarily, but through taxes. 

Also, who is setting which standards? You are being deliberately opaque. 

>A programme can be monitored, adjusted, and if necessary, terminated. It doesn't have to involve govts directly, and it can be done cooperatively. 

Which programme? Monitored and adjusted by who?

You have basically no idea how something like this would work (spoiler: it wouldn't), but feel like saying it isn't complicated. "
"'We' give our money to organisations which we believe will start actively solving problems. Or we create organisations if they do not exist. 

Unless what you mean to say is that it's not possible for organsisations carrying out international aid to actually carry it out. That they are all in some way inherently corrupt or ineffective. 

In that case we have a much worse issue, in that it would seem that at all levels human society have failed. If you think that is true, then you're much more cynical and fatalist than I am. "
"So you couldn't answer a single point I made. Got it.

  


I'm not cynical or fatalist. I'm being realistic, and I've done work in developmental economics (since I majored in Econ til several months ago). Sweatshops are not actively virtuous, but they are the least-bad alternative for many countries, and they've improved quality of life for a lot of people. If you'd rather play a Civilization game with millions of human lives, that's on you."
"Wait a fucking second here. This is foul.

When you first posted a response, it said 'Which organisations do we give our money to?'. One sentence. To which I replied.

You then came in and ninja-edited an entirely different reply in order to accuse me of not being able to answer your questions.

This is downright dishonest, and certainly unprofessional. It paints you as a really shitty person who doesn't care about the topic, but rather just wants to 'win', by any means necessary. 

I would be happy to engage you on the substance of your points. But, I will only do so if you apologise for the asshole ninja-edit. Otherwise you can fuck right off."
"I edited **before** you answered. You could say you didn't get to see my edited comment before answering (totally fair), but you're getting mad without even checking the timestamps, in an attempt to shift the focus. You already proved you have no idea what you're talking about, only making obtuse, broad points based on what you feel should be done. Cheers."
"You edited AFTER you posted. Which means you posted material for me to see, then changed it substantively. You set up a situation where you knew I was replying to a comment you'd changed. If you wanted to be honest, and to guarantee that I saw the comment you actually intended, you should have deleted your comment so that I couldn't reply. Then reposted the right one.

And since you knew that you'd changed your comment, opening with 'So you failed to answer any of my questions' is an arsehole thing to do, which is absolutely fair for me to be mad at. It's like the second-worst thing one redditor can do to another. 

Likewise, it's also totally unfair to accuse me of lacking specificity in reply to you (as if you deserve it) when we have to deal with the [meta] matter before hand. I'm sorry but I haven't in any way acted in bad faith here, this is not a tactic for me, it's a standard I expect others to meet. I don't edit my replies in such a way to weaponise them, either to you or to anyone else. And I won't allow you to do it either. What you're doing *is* a tactic: you could have said 'Hey I changed my reply, did you see it?' before condemning me as an incompetent. This tells me everything I need to know about you as both a person and a 'professional'. 

So, gwan and fuck right off."

Streetwear
 Baseball caps have made a strong resurgence following the apparent fall of the flat brim cap.
Depending on who you hang out with it's either all super loud streetwear or its a laid back thrift store look. 
"sock sneakers, dad sneakers, loud logos"
Juul
"Supreme. Dad shoes. 90s branding shirt (ie Hilfiger , Guess , Fila) and fanny packs across chest. "
"Very brand-focused streetwear; Supreme, Bape, and the like. The prep phase of a few years ago has pretty much passed by now."
Athleisure 
Basketball shorts
"The streetwear fuccboi look. Adidas track pants, oversized tops, and hyped-up sneakers."
"It depends on where you live. Here in Sweden(atleast in my experience) most teenagers wear Hugo Boss, Armani, Versace, KENZO  and GANT. Usually buying a t-shirt/sweatshirt/hoodie from these brands and mix it with black/blue jeans and white/black shoes.

I keep seeing brands like Supreme, Fred Perry and Lacoste less and less. Levis is still ""famous"" here. Also, Hollister and FILA are getting more popular here."
"Balenciaga, Off White, Supreme, Palace"
"In the Scandinavian countries, high fashion and throwback/nostalgia has really took off. You either have people going around looking like woodstock from the 70/80‚Äôs, or the more modern people going for ¬´hyped¬ª looks with minimalist brands and the occasional gucci, versace, etc. Also, long hair is really in right now, and bonus if you‚Äôre wearing a random baseball cap."
Can someone please tell me what is going on with teens and their socks? When did wearing massive crew socks with shorts become a thing? 
"Fakes. Let's be honest here. Fake Supremes, Yeezys, etc. I see helluva lot more fakes with teens (who are prone to flaunting it as real too) than people older than them."
"In Australia right now, denim jackets"
"Supreme and Ultraboosts, bruh"
"Obviously depends on where you live but I'm a teenager in the UK and athlesuire is a a big trend at the moment. Also bulky Nike trainers, and socks with slides for some reason. "

All I know is that I‚Äôm getting old."
Expensive Clothing brand fakes and pinks along with pastel colors.
"Vintage clothing from all eras but mostly the 80s and 90s. Boyfriend jeans, Guess, Tommy Hilfiger, Fila, Champion, Dad hats, Vans, chucks, dad sneakers, etc. if it‚Äôs not vintage its street wear so like skinny jeans, Yeezys, boosts, airmax, new balance, oversized Ts, shit like that. Oh and fanny packs. "
"Sneakers;

Variations of ripped jeans;

Sweater with shorts combo;

Bomber jacket;

Hi cropped pants;

Good amount of accessories, namely bracelets;"

"I'm a senior in college and my little brother is a junior in high school so I feel like I have a decent opinion on the topic. This is all from what I've seen in my personal life so YMMV

It's pretty much in three different camps from what I see. 

1. Streetwear is huge right now, and stuff like vans have gotten super big with the streetwear crowd. Not my cup of tea but I definitely enjoy some looks. I like a lot of Kanye's tops (the kind of boxy muted earth tones are dope)

2. The kind of grungy look is still big where I live (midwest). My brother wears a lot of big flannels/skinny jeans/vans and so do a lot of his friends. I would say a lot of my friends dress pretty similar as well. Thrifting is still real popular. I'd also lump in somewhat of the SLP aesthetic (think Harry Styles) with loose patterned short sleeve button ups and skinny black jeans.

3. Everything else - A lot of guys just wear whatever clothes they have. Random hoodies jeans etc the usual.

Also in the summer I feel like a lot of people just wear shorts and t shirts cause its comfortable.
"
"Athletic wear has always been teen couture (adidas track pants/shoes), comfortable clothes that are also form fitting "
"It‚Äôs really strange that some of the brands around in my youth such as Fila and Donnay have really come back in.  

When I was at school in the 90s, you‚Äôd be ridiculed for wearing Fila and now the kids want it "
"Streetwear, cross body bags, dad hats, ""ugly"" sunglasses, dad shoes. Glance over Supreme, Balenciaga, LV - you'll get a quick overview of where the trends are situated and how big fashion houses are taking it to heart"
"Up here in the tiny village of Vancouver, BC, for boys it's still wearing your pants around your thighs and underwear low enough for half your ass to be visible."
Vans and superstars. Just... Vans and superstars...
Crop tops
Socks n sliders.
Denim Jackets for sure
"Here in Austria, you see guys wearing loosely-fit/baggy clothes in daring, but tones down colours, pants rolled up to show your ankles or tennis socks. 2nd-hand is popular among these people.

Then there are the ones wearing streetwear, including skinny and/or ripped jeans, baseball caps or snapbacks, sneakers, slim or long fit tees. Sometimes even wearing a waist pouch bag from one shoulder across your chest or a gymsack. Brands like Gucci, Adidas, Armani, Tommy Hilfiger, Champion are popular among this group.

At the moment, fashion is inspired heavily by german rap artists."
"Heavily branded tees, with long basketball shorts, high socks with sliders."
"Champion, Fila, Nike and Adidas, socks with slides (adidas or nike), track pants, a real focus on comfy clothing when just hanging out with friends. Levi's are in, especially with denim jackets. Athleasure is pretty big, especially when casually hanging out with friends. For the more fashion forward, vintage stuff is in. Jeans with rips, like pretty much every era, is in. I rarely see dark indigo denim, its usually black or light blue. Since I live in the PNW we see a lot of rain jackets and north face/Patagonia stuff. Jansport or Falraven Kraken (excuse my spelling lol) backpacks. Athleasure has definitely made fashion more comfort-orientated for us. 

I know some older folks here will find it sloppy and in poor taste, especially sweat pants and socks and slides but because its so common with us, we just find it pretty normal. We don't really consider it lazy or sloppy, as long as its the tapered sweatpants. And socks and slides are truly the most comfortable footwear possible, so we are pretty open about it."
Brandwear lmao
"Actually teen fashio doesn't change much.

The basics revolve around skate&surf clothing (It has been like that for almost 20 years).

In the last 5-10 years sport brands slowly got into the mix. So you have a strong athleisure influence now. 

Regarding trends, which change super fast, you can kind of get a sense of that by watching some youtube videos of popular youtubers. Super hyped stuff like supreme and yezzy sneakers. 

So I'm guessing the base is the same but mixed and matched with some hyped stuff. "
"I‚Äôm a middle school teacher and see the whole kit and caboodle. For a portion of brave, young males, skinny jeans. For another larger population, baggy jeans, rarely with a belt.

College aesthetic too tbh
What is Juul ? E-cigarettes ?
did you say fanny packs across chest??
I never see bape worn nowadays tbh
"I don't think that's trending right now, at least where I live. Supreme and especially Bape are not nearly as sought after as it were a few years ago. Not quite sure what you mean with ""prep phase"", but derbies, (oversized) shirts and dress pants are definitely still trending."

The truest answer here
Filipinos taking over fashion
How can teens afford that?
What? In Stockholm most teenagers either wear Ralph lauren top to bottom or the vintage looking clothes.
"What? Where in Sweden do you live and how old are you?

In Gothenburg, around 15-19 most popular brands are probably Gucci, Dondup jeans, LV, Belstaff. Lots of non-logo stuff also. Oh and maybe a year ago everyone wore these Limitato tees with a photo printed on front."
"Would add Les Deux, Stone Island, CP Company and most likely vans shoes. Also slim jeans"
Gant is the only true regular from what I've seen here in Stockholm. 
"How about countries that actually matter?

Yea we get it. In Sweden its all designer black clothing just like it is every year."
for some reason i find it hard to believe that teens can afford balenciaga.
You forgot Gucci logofont tees! I had to go into Harvey Nichols in Bristol last weekend and it was alive with teens in Gucci tees manhandling all the Off-White.
"I think, at least where I live, the long hair trend died like 2 years ago. People got tired of it, now most people cut it shorter again."
Since 2008 when Nike started making the Elite socks with the stripe on the back. When I was in HS kids used to wear 3 pairs at a time staggered so you could see the different colors.
I recall that being an important part of bro style when I was leaving high school in 2007.
Denim jacket with Sherling collars
"Yeah, I see this a lot. Pale, pastel tones have come into fashion, as well as lighter stonewashed denim colours."
also a resurgence of mainstream people wearing nike TN's instead of just lads and crystal pistol kings
u still living in 2016 bruh

I think 5-panel/camp caps will be coming in again. A lot of streetwear brands have been pushing them again this year.
I agree.
For a while it was faux-prep (think Vineyard Vines) and the abercrombie bro look before that

it's just cuz it's maison margiela 
"ya there were definitely some weirder than others lol. being an average height guy with 5:5 ratio body, socks sneakers definitely helps because of how streamlined it looks pairing with a similar colour pants.

Either fakes or money from their parents.

"Not really that much. Here in NY I can buy a shitty Hugo Boss or Versace t Shirt at C21, TJ Max or Marshalls for less than $20. I imagine that as long as the shirt has a logo on the front the kids don‚Äôt really care what the shirt really looks like. "
"Forgot about RL! Yeah ive noticed that alot of teenagers in Stockholm wear RL and the other brands from Johnells.

The brands I mentioned are the ones most people in √ñsterg√∂tland wear. "

Here in Germany many ""highschool"" (althought that doesnt really exist here) students work a 450‚Ç¨ a month job on the side, and since theyre still living with their parents who still buy all necessities for them, they can blow those 450‚Ç¨ on whatever they want. If you then make an effort to save 100-200‚Ç¨ of that per month for clothes , you can purchase a few designer pieces a year

"
"I ain't seen kids in Balenciaga. It's been a while since those were a fad with the kids. Personally, I love that old chunky shit. I'm on that Achilles High number."
Those socks are so thick.. how did they even fit their foot in their shoe??
Palwave
"Dressing androgynous makes sense to me for young guys.

Most of them don't look typically masculine. Muscle mass isn't completely developped, facial hair are scarce.

What are you gonna do? Try to look like your dad and fail hard? Maybe, but also maybe try to do your own thing and borrow from women style like countless non-typically-masculine icons have done, like Bowie or Prince."
"They definitely are. I mean here before they became trendy, people even here on MFA would ask how to carry stuff if you're carrying more than phone/keys/wallet. The answer (at least in streetwear today) is these waistpacks/fanny packs/small shoulder bags"
"It sucks, cause I really did enjoy basic curved-brim hats that you‚Äôd find at stores with titles of states, coffee shops, a small brand, or something like that. 

Then all of the sudden, a year and a half later, all these brands start putting pizzas on the middle of hats and sell them everywhere, and some with these edgy quotes like, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt feel.‚Äù or something, and then ‚Äî it just made caps more boring and obnoxious now. 

Plus, I feel like people over accessorize now, with hats, glasses, watches, necklaces, bracelets, even really show-y shoes all in one fit ‚Äî it‚Äôs a lot going on. 

Anyways. "
"^ so true. 

Back in middle school and early high school (2006-2010) it was all about Hollister, AE, and Abercrombie. Abercrombie was as preppy as anyone around my way got.

2011 was when more peoppe caught onto streerwear. The skate kids and African American kids were already hip to all that stuff though "
"I live in Edinburgh, seems like the most you see here is women wearing Fila disruptors and that's it really "
"I like going to the jeweler

I put rocks all in my watch"
"Margiela may have influenced the other designers, but it was definitely Balenciaga that created the hype"
"CP track was the comfiest CP I've ever had compare to achilles, retro and bball, plus it increases my height too :P"
both of those suggestions look really boring
There is some actual utility in them. I hate having anything in my pockets and having a sling or day pack is super helpful. 
I truly dont know what to say about this... nothing I can think of to say can truly express how fucking idiotic that is. 
"I've just finished high school, and at least where I live, all of the ""hype beasts"" were wearing yeezys, supreme, assc and shit like that. I don't see a lot of people wearing bape apart from rich asian students "
Bape in streetwear has died down and is not as big anymore. 
"I'm in Edinburgh, in Scotland. Only time I see people wearing OW, Gucci, Yeezys, BAPE, Supreme etc is on rich Chinese students at the uni"
or you know.... a job?
Real Versace for 20?
"Ikr, I love Lacoste, makes quality stuff "
Yea when Hollister is increasing in popularity that means I've immediately discarded your people.
not so sure about that one either
Supreme isn‚Äôt expensive if you can manage to buy items when they drop. It‚Äôs only the reselling that‚Äôs expensive.
"no, they just wear fakes."
"Lots can. If you work part time, or get money from your parents, it's not really hard to save up a few hundreds."
Supreme for retail isn‚Äôt that expensive 
No one does this though. Kids don‚Äôt care enough to spend 750 on a baggy shirt
Buy bigger shoes bro 
Size up
"Im not your pal, bud"
"I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs so much about having or not having masculine features, but more of what just happens to be cool in the scene. 

When I was in high school in the mid 2000s, we would buy women‚Äôs jeans to wear, because skinny jeans were a rare find in the men‚Äôs section. Now skinny jeans are fully adopted by the mainstream and what made you stand out and get called a hipster then is close to the standard dress now. 

I think the youth are just finding their own style to stand out with now, which doesn‚Äôt resonate with me anymore now that I‚Äôm older. "
"LOL, I just bought one off the street and I'm waaay older than a teenager. Damnit."
"You bring up a really good point. I agree and that‚Äôs the thing about fashion. While all these things you mentioned can all be available at one place, picking and choosing what to wear would make a difference. For example, if I wear a graphic or band tee and keep the rest simple with raw denim and CPs, I would look better than someone who would throw on a graphic tee, ripped jeans, NMDs, sunglasses and pizza logo ‚Äúdad hats‚Äù all at once."
"They'll be in for a while but just avoid the obvious meme ones. More muted colors and logos are fine. A simple plain one or something with something simple like an adidas logo = ok. A pink one with an embroidered rose or a cheeky phrase like ""Das a vibe"" = way too tired right now.

As far as other trends, I'm starting to see more trucker hats, 5-panel camp hats, structured 5- and 6-panel hats, etc. coming back, especially with stuff like cloth or leather straps in the back to make sure they're not full 2010-era colorful snapbacks."
"True true, depended on who you ran with tho. I never thought the Abercrombie double polo shirt color popped boys looked very fashionable "
">Fila disruptors

A god awful shoe"
"right, I keep getting the two mixed up, I was thinking about the black speed trainers, and thought it was either or"
"cross chest fanny pack instantly says ""coke dealer"" to me.  at least that's how it was back through the 00's"

Ok
"Piggybacking off this one, I live in an incredibly wealthy town and there are still only a handful of highschoolers there who wear hypebeast-level streetwear shit. I'd say <20 for a school of 1600 students with mostly wealthy parents"
"Oh I am too, I've been wearing one lately as well. I alternate between that and a camera sling bag. As long as it's not an [obnoxious Supreme number](https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/6-gettyimages-632101768-1498058824.jpg) and you're not wearing it with loud clothes you'll look fine. 

If wearing it across your chest seems too showy just wear it as a sling on your back.

Also you did it right by just buying something off the street. I see way too many for like $100 when in the end it's just literally a fanny pack."

...unless you *want* to look like a hypebeast fuccboi"
"But there are different ways to be over the top then mismatched hypeboi shit. Kapital has an awesome way of making layering, over accessorizing, and clashing patterns in an americana feel work. Same with parts of SLP but with rockstar flair, and some japanese fashion stuff like junya and other have that going on too. I feel like the crisp raw denim, and CP looks good, but super mundane.

Plus I loveeeeee raw denim, but only after the 17th visible repair, patchwork, and fades that are also fading. I like being a little loud. "
"Hell no. I was scared to walk into the Abercrombie store, I thought it was only for rich white kids lol.

American eagle was more welcoming, pacsun and Zumiez too"
I kinda like them on women

That's pretty much how it came to be - the UK hood look got co-opted and went mainstream

It's not that hard even at minimum wage if you are willing to put the hours in and have no other expenses

"Probably this year, maybe early next. They're already hiring staff so sooner rather than later."
But with expenses it‚Äôs impossible at that age 
"Like I said, you need to have no other expenses. I just graduated but I did this all throughout high school. Paychecks are 200 save some in my brokerage and then the rest save until you want something off Grailed or an ssense sale. Easy."
Interested what expanses you had when you were a teenager
People in that age range who buy clothes in those types of price ranges aren't the kids with no expenses. Most likely hitting the clubs every weekend.

"God that writing style is overly ostentatious. But, posh and aspirational target audience and all that.

But I have enjoyed this series of house tours by Mr. Porter."
"Never worn a RO piece but my man lives my lifestyle to the fullest. Wake up at 8, have a coffee, maybe hit the beach, always a nap. No clutter, all the mental space to nap. Seen his place before and I love it. "
"I met Rick randomly while I was visiting Venice! I was just drinking coffee and look over and see him like 2 tables over and I've never been more star struck! He's a nice dude.

https://i.imgur.com/EgaHMaw.jpg"
"I mean this is very cool and artsy, but at the same time it feels very dead and lonely. No family pictures on the walls (granted those were prob not photographed), big white walls with no character. The furniture pieces are choice. It's definitely simplistic. "
"As rick said ‚Äúgo to the gym buy less clothes,‚Äù I guess same minimalism thought applied to his home.

Edit typo "
The guy definitely has an eye for architectural design. I was not expecting him to name drop Le Corbusier and Italian Futurism. And those busts are fucking GORGEOUS (despite being of Mussolini). 
"Rick Owens looks exactly like I'd expect him to. 

I love him"
I do love this. Pretty open and a lot of lights and breezy. Something i am trying but failing miserably at Grad School Stipend.
Even the way he lays his towel down is aesthetically pleasing

"Iggy is 71, however, which is straight up insane because that is my parents' age and I cannot imagine them belting out ""No Fun"". "

"Yeah, and I don't like the worship. Although maybe I'm not used to these attempts to write ""intimately"" about these kinds of people."
I take this writing style over the more casual one that certain publications have adopted over the years. I feel it‚Äôs more descriptive and fulfilling. 
"Whatever do you mean, Mr. Afacnonymous? Its most enbiggining."
"Other than some of the references, I don't find it too pretentious. I've read much much worse, at least. There are Pulitzer-winning journalists who use ridiculous adjectives and obscure foreign words all over the place when a simple word will do, because I guess they're just bored of effective communication."
"Hah that‚Äôs funny. As I was reading this I was thinking ‚Äúman I really really like this article, I should read more of these!‚Äù. Does that make me pretentious wanna-be posh? Maybe :P"
8 its the perfect time to wake up imo. Not too early and not to late.
Holy fucked he's veined out in that photo haha
"Oh wow, well done you!"
Thanks for sharing
He seems smaller than what I imagined
">I mean this is very cool and artsy, but at the same time it feels very dead and lonely.

Rick Owens in a nutshell."
"> ‚ÄúI had a very formal vision in mind,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúA very severe formality. But whenever I do that there are huge places to sprawl. People say, ‚ÄòThe furniture is so severe,‚Äô and I go, ‚ÄòYeah, but I have huge mattresses that you just plop on top.‚Äô So it‚Äôs all about reclining.‚Äù"
"I read it as almost a monastery or a sacred place: very specific intent and purpose; nothing more than what is essential. Simultaneously decadent (materials) and spartan. 

Not dead and lonely, necessarily, but devoid of all things non-essential ‚Ä¶¬†almost like the sky from a mountaintop: an open expanse with nothing to interfere."
"It looks comfortable as fuck to me, clean and simple with beautiful textured materials and lots of books. I appreciate the lack of colour and relative sparseness of the interior.

It's also not that big a space, the mirror wall makes it look a lot bigger as do the low PoV and wide angles of the photos."
Must be a taste thing. I would hate having family picture-type stuff on my walls.
"Does Japanese minimalism culture give you that same vibe?  


I like the fact that he can manage to have understatement and extravagance at the same time, he has his very own way of balancing them."
"It's bare bones and not in a glamorous way either. 

Feels like a modest sterile place to live. Not high minimalistic to be honest. He's keeping himself hungry on purpose."
"I thought so too, but the line about brushing your teeth in a stark black marble sink is setting yourself to do your best I can understand.

I'd imagine creative individuals don't have an on/off tap for their inspiration/mojo/whatever you want to call it, so it makes sense that you'd deck out your surroundings in a way to coax out that inspiration whenever possible."
So leaving your pants at home when going to the gym?
he designs furniture too!
Is ricks stuff considered brutalist? Or does he pull from that? It seems to me that he does but I don‚Äôt know enough about architecture to be able to say so with certainty.
"I expected more style and severity. He seems like a simple guy, I suppose I'm more extreme and I projected a grander vision of his aesthetics in his home life. "
"when he said he wants to be your dog, he specifically meant mexican hairless"
"I saw Iggy the other week, that man is a machine. "
He's a pretty cool guy if you talk to him one on one. 
"I agree with you. I have what‚Äôs probably a very average reading level, but I really appreciate the writer‚Äôs ability to paint such a vivid picture (the images helped). The effort is worth noticing in my opinion. Also, as much as I don‚Äôt like Rick‚Äôs clothing aesthetically, I really like where he comes from (his entire perspective and influences along with his humble beginnings are always great to read about). I‚Äôd love to have a cup of coffee with him over any other designer."
It should really be a human right.
Na dw rick is like 8 feet
"Oh god you're right, this is a perfect description of everything about him and his work."
Or the desk at an office that follows 5s.
"It depends on the space. A space with more angles and interesting nooks might be OK, however in a home where most of the rooms are flat ceiling and rectangular it would feel more clinical and meaningless to me. And then again it really depends what I chose to fill the space with. 1 fantastic piece of furniture beats dozens of other just OK things to fill the space. JMHO. "
"Japanese minimalism is more in touch with nature, the materials are organic, the colors are different. This just reminds one of like he said, jail cell of sorts."
Lol typo should of been buy but way funnier this way. 
"I've been low key wanting some leggings, but I'm nowhere near large enough to wear them to the gym and not get beat up in the locker room"
"And it's super cool! I especially love the ""half-box"" as he calls it made of ox bone. Such a cool texture. "
Yes you could argue it is influenced by it for sure. Brutalism refers to architecture though
Are you talking about his apartment or his clothes? Brutalism has a very specific meaning so I‚Äôd say no if you‚Äôre referencing what he‚Äôs done with his apartment. 
"I wouldn't say so but I find futurist and brutalist share some similar asthetics, however brutalist is significantly darker."
yes he has said his main inspiration comes from architecture 
I'm crying here!

With the amount of redditors on STEM I'm surprised they are not more common. 
"Right on!

It's more that I'd look less like a fit dude with the stones to wear leggings, and more like a scrawny guy who never outgrew his angsty emo teens, lmao (the fact that I may or may not be lifting to the new Fall Out Boy album doesn't help, but no one knows that but me!)

Maybe I need some short shorts instead."
"Just bought this Suit Supply suit.

Ignore the shoes and shirt. The suit has been tailored already, but I got it in the mail which is why it is a bit wrinkly.

Thoughts?"
"Love the color though I would consider it a seasonal option. Regarding fit, it does look a tad bit tight around the chest, the rest looks fine. In length, the pants are shorter than you regularly see given there isn't much of a natural break. Regarding arm length you want about half an inch to maybe an inch of the long sleeve shirt poking out from the coat. Personally like the shirt, when it comes to brown shoes with that shade of blue I'd go lighter brown than darker."
"Decent fit, different shoes might make it better. Something like white sneakers, boat shoes or loafers would be interesting."
Looks really good
"It looks like it's a bit big on you. I can't tell for sure but it also looks a bit too wide in the shoulders.

Also, it doesn't work with those pants or shirt even if it fit a bit better."
"I would either untuck or go for a looser tuck. Maybe a cuff or hem on the jeans, but looks good "
"With that being said, as long as the event isn't super formal such as a wedding you'd be fine with that fit."
"Thanks. Regarding the pants, you can see my socks though if I am standing straight, there is maybe a half inch or more of exposure. Too short? "
"Yeah the pants are actually a totally different color than they look, the lighting in there was terrible and the camera was like an iPhone 4"
"Interesting. I've never got a feel for untucked shirts. Always kind of looked like an apron to me. I think I need to get more comfortable with a slightly disheveled look.

That blazer is just not the type that should be worn with any pants of that style.

"Gold bond, cedar shoe trees, soaking orthotics on occasion "
"When you find a question you know the answer to.  

So, step one: Don't wear the same shoes every day.  
Now your shoes have a day to dry out and the time for bacteria to die.  

Spray your shoes with an antibacterial/antifungal spray.  They should be in the health and beauty section near foot insoles.  Every time you take your shoes off put the laces inside the shoe then spray them both.  

If you're still having trouble, get a tub with a lid, some kitty litter, dryer sheets, and a couple of socks.  Shred/cut the dryer sheets and add some kitty litter, then fill a sock approximately to full and tie it off.  Leave that in overnight after spraying the shoes.  This helps desiccate the shoes and destroy the home for bacteria and fungi to breed.  

Still have problems?  Alright, you can hand wash some shoes.  That'll destroy other shoes.  Your mileage may vary.  

I've never had any problems past these options as a solution.  I know it works for work boots when you're using them for 12 hours a day and daily driver shoes.  Once you eventually solve your immediate shoe problem it should stay solved by switching shoes daily and then spraying them."
"Shoe trees are a must and letting them rest by having a rotation of at least 2 pairs. 

Clean socks and feet also help. "
"Wash your feet.

Seriously.

Soap them up and scrub.  If you've got a handheld showerhead, throw that shit on the laser massage setting and get in between your toes and everything.

You will be genuinely surprised at how clean they feel, and you will then think about how gross it is that they've never felt that clean before."
shoe dryer
"* Wash your feet daily
* Activated carbon insoles
* Wool socks
* Rotate shoes
* Shoe trees"
I try to air them out near a windoe
"If you're lazy, dryer sheets, but they're more of a stop gap to some of the things recommended in here."
"I bought this about a month ago - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B013TSRYUS/

I spray a couple times in each shoe after I am done wearing them, all of my shoes smell real fresh each time and not at all perfume-y. You‚Äôll want to wait at least 12 hours after you spray to wear them though so they have time to dry. Highly recommend."
Socks. Shoe trees. Good hygiene.  
"shoe trees, wanna know how i know they work? ive worn the same pair of socks every day this week because i put the socks on cedar shoe trees at the end of each day as an experiment. every morning they have a fresh woody smell"
Having a rotation is very important. Sometimes you have to let the shoe air and dry out. Having another pair to wear while the other one is airing out will help with the smell and will increase the lifespan of the shoe. 
What the hell
Ew
No judgement dude

"> shoe trees, wanna know how i know they work? ive worn the same pair of socks every day this week because i put the socks on cedar shoe trees at the end of each day as an experiment. every morning they have a fresh woody smell

some judgement "
"next 3 words are literally ""as an experiment"""
You're a brave person.
"i mean, they literally didnt stink"
This might give some insight into why fashion is cyclical.
I personally think it‚Äôs somewhat opposite. Clothing and style to me is aspirational - what am I going to be doing in the future and what am I going to be wearing when I‚Äôm doing it? What is it I am trying to portray and who is it that I‚Äôve become or want to become?
"That‚Äôs absolutely true for certain pieces. They remind me of where I was when I bought them. 

Sneakers without a doubt rely on memory because of the whole sneaker head culture. I remember going to sneakercons with my son and having a great time looking for steals. Or look at the phenomenon of streetwear lineups like Supreme. You can recall shared experiences while you wait to get your grails with like-minded fanatics.

In addition to the sub culture aspect, clothes for me also relate an emotional attachment that the OP also talked about. Like the denim jacket my father gave me which I still wear. So there‚Äôs definitely a sense of personal history behind pieces."
"I'd be more okay with this if it was more of a personal anecdote rather than stated as ""how people should (or do) form their style"". 
I have pretty much no personal connection to leather riding jackets but my black DR is one of my most worn pieces. 

I can see some truth to it, but it sounds like there's a bit of the authenticity factor that people like to talk about around here. As if exploring a style which doesn't directly connect to your ""summers spent in Santa Fe"" then your style is inauthentic. 

Feels very much like repackaged ""what your grandpa wore"" from the heritage/Americana trend that hit so hard."
Now that I think about it. A lot of the workwear inspired pieces are things my grandfather has and still wears. 
"I disagree with it as a rule. Yes it's the case for some, but I'm not sure why one would try to apply that as a blanket rule. It's saying that the emotions associated with memory are what primarily drive appreciation of clothing (which is then incorporated into personal style). I agree that happy emotions are what drive that appreciation, but they can come from anywhere; they're not exclusive to memory. I personally like clothes related in some way to surrealism, but that's not because I have memories of liking surrealism in the past."
"I'm sure this applies to some folks, but as someone who would rather wear a black shirt/sweater & black skinny jeans every single day forever & always, with no particular memories/emotions/ideas affiliated with that, it certainly does not apply to all."
"For me it was growing up poor. like poor poor. I always had the 'wrong' designer or producer for everything. Everyone had an Atari (I'm dating my self here) I had an Intelivision. Everyone wore Gap (I mean come on -- it's just Gap) and I had some off-brand that no one heard of. Growing up is hard enough without sticking out like a sore thumb because you are not wearing what everyone else is.

Well now I'm at an age and disposable income that I can wear what I want, when I want, and also give zero fucks what other people think. So in trying to find my own style, I have also come full circle from my childhood but without a doubt it has defined my clothing purchase experiences through the many iterations of growing up that I have passed through."
"Honestly depends on the individuals mindset as well. Growing up around a variety of cultures has shown me how easy/difficult it is for people to either assimilate to the fashion around them, or find their own style. 

To me the greatest irony is people thinking they have their own unique sense of style when all they are doing is following the latest trends. I'm not saying it's necessarily a bad thing, but saying it's unique when it's being mass marketed is ironic as hell. "
"Ideally there is a combination of a romance and sentimentality for the garments with a naturally flattering appearance in wearing them  


Too often people cling to the costume of a different person that will never fit them"
"I don't know if it's necessarily *memories*. Sometimes the coincidence is another trigger -- a sale, or the fact that you already happen to have an item that matches, or it fits a niche you need filled, or you've been hearing great things about a brand but you hated all of their styles until now...

But yeah, it's not total random, nor a perfect plan -- your personal style is going to grow a certain way at least partly by accident."
"It could work both ways. It's a case of the chicken or the egg.

Personally, I think that the memories follow the style, rather than style coming about as a result of memories. That style then becomes cemented and even further refined by the memories. There doesn't seem to be much memories associated with most things in my wardrobe, prior to owning them. It is after purchasing and using them that memories come about...as in, I wore this jacket to a particular location, or used this suit on some memorable occasion.

For example, there's a pair of slippers I used while walking through icy cold waters in a pitch black tunnel to catch sight of glow worms. Or that three piece suit and bow tie I wore to my wedding. A flannel shirt I wore for all my recent picturesque hikes overseas. They had no memories attached to them prior to their ownership. But now that I have used them in those scenarios, they hold some memories for me.

The only exception I might argue is my liking for beach shorts when the weather is extremely warm and the setting favours its use. In this case it reflects my childhood attraction to the warm sand of the beach beneath my feet, the warm waters of the sea around my calves, and the warm sea breeze on my face. There's a certain nonchalance and carefree vibe to that whole scenario that I really enjoy and want to remember."
"I think personal style is as coincidental as the hobbies you end up enjoying, or career that you work.  That is where the ""happy coincidences "" of style comes from.  Like, stylistic choices for practical reasons due to your trade, aesthetic choices based on your hobbies, and the era that grew up in.  It seems lot of that is lost on kids nowadays where sub-cultures have melted together, and any ""style"" can worn for the day..."
"Fashion and personal taste can definitely stem from positive sources and personal background. (Growing up as a military brat, I learned to get an appreciation for techwear and military inspired fits as they were easy for me to attain).

However, my general interest in fashion stemmed because of how uninspired i was by my surroundings. I wound up moving to a conservative, southern city that i hated so i didn't want to end up looking like the norm. I wanted to wear dope fits like Kanye or A$AP did, not wear vineyard vines and boat shoes like every other kid here."
"I thought I was semi-original for my take on fitted short-sleeved button downs with the sleeves rolled up a little, accompanied by a pair of ~5 inch shorts and a nice black pair of loafers.

Find myself flipping through old childhood photos and in birthday after birthday (5-10 years old) and what do I see? My father in oversized button-downs with the sleeves rolled up, accompanied by a nice pair of khaki/light navy shorts and brown leather loafers.

My father passed away when I was 13 due to kidney failure and he stopped ‚Äúdressing up‚Äù years before. Some part of me internalized his style from when I was a child and encouraged me to recreate it as a young adult. I would absolutely agree that positive memories connected to certain articles of clothing definitely create a lasting impression on people."
"Anything that triggers some sort of positive memory will draw us in.

Be it clothings, furnitures, ornaments or even a simple PC background.

Personally, i think a person style reflects their fashion taste. We simply dress the way we envision ourselves to look."
"Nah.

1. Being a poser/following trends.

2. Comfort

3. Deals. This Purple Label tuxedo is ¬£4000 and I can get it for ¬£200? Bought, even though I will likely never wear it."
"I'd say it's less actual nostalgia and more fabricated nostalgia from the fashion industry to convince you to buy more things. I doubt people were clamoring for the days gone by when their parents wore mom jeans, dad sneakers, and fanny packs, yet here they are from high fashion houses.

Another aspect of the cyclical nature of fashion is that silhouettes have to change so companies can sell more. If skinny jeans (for example) were always in style we'd reach a point where everyone had them and had no reason to buy any more beyond replacing due to wear and tear. 

It's an extremely cynical take on it, but I find it difficult to be anything but cynical and critical of large fashion houses and the sections of the fashion industry that pander to and/or copy them."
"Absolutely. My theory has always been that fashion goes through (roughly) 20 year cycles because there's roughly 20 years between your formative childhood memories and your emancipation as an adult with a job and expendable income. Memories from being 4-10 start influencing your choices at 24-30, when you have money to spend on yourself, post-college and pre-parenthood."
"I love this! Very ""dress for the job you want."""
I disagree that he is talking about an authenticity factor. I think he is just saying you gravitate towards items or style that brings fond memories or connections from your past. This could be something like watching movies or TV shows that you liked where a character you liked or related to always wore a black DR.
"Yup, my workwear stuff reminds me of things I remember my dad and grandfather wearing, though I'm more picky about quality and fit, and don't tend to wear things out as hard. But I'm sure that's part of what makes the style feel comfortable and natural for me. 

On the other hand, I make plenty of style decisions that are not nostalgic at all, that I have no past associations with, but rather just consider to be cool or interesting or practical."
I doubt the marketing would resonate if there wasn't anything there to evoke.
"I'd argue that such cycles are more about an exclusivity treadmill of social signaling - when the masses are embracing skinny jeans, the ""cool"" elite can't use them to telegraph that they are ""cool"" elite. So they move on to something else, which will also trickle down over time, eventually necessitating the next cool trend."
"Do you disagree that there is real nostalgia or good memories stemming from things like mom jeans, dad sneakers, and fanny packs? Because I feel like that is real personally, not just fabricated nostalgia. Although I would agree that they are also trying to create nostalgia by pandering to our fond/happy memories of those times and garments."
"Though cynical, there's definitely some accuracy to this statement. Companies want to make money. But I also feel that designers and people on the more artistic side of fashion keep trying to push the envelope and change the medium in which they work, thus causing changes in style and the fashion industry. This is why companies employ them, to keep making new ideas so they can keep selling these new ideas."
Who has nostalgia for the fanny pack?
"I don't necessarily have nostalgia for the fanny pack, but I have nostalgia for times in my childhood when the people who cared for me wore fanny packs occasionally. It doesn't seem like too much of a stretch."

"Do it slowly.

Avoid the temptation to buy ""everything you will ever need"" all at once. Strong chance you estimated your life's needs and personal taste incorrectly and you will want more of one item and less of something else pretty soon after you *just* bought a pile of clothes.

Buy only what you will wear and [wear everything you own.](https://coubsecure-s.akamaihd.net/get/b99/p/coub/simple/cw_timeline_pic/92e8324094e/f8e0003484e9b86f4a0f3/big_1515162704_image.jpg)"
"Find stuff you‚Äôre comfortable in opposed to what‚Äôs in. If you see a shirt and you like it but maybe your friends don‚Äôt? Buy it anyway (given it‚Äôs not a stupid dumb price that you know it isn‚Äôt worth). Prime example is I‚Äôve got a Red & White striped shirt with a WNDRR (the brand) embroidery on the chest, my lawd do I get called Where‚Äôs Wally a lot but it‚Äôs a comfortable shirt and I like the look of it. Don‚Äôt be afraid to experiment with different looks you wanna see yourself in! If you really care for your appearance there‚Äôs a lot of trial and error to be had. Best of luck! :) "
"Go to a thrift store, I wish I started this when I was younger. You can find some expensive clothes cheap."
"Don't buy it unless you LOVE IT. if you are meh about it, you will never wear it.

""I like it but......"" Means, don't buy it."
"How old are you as a young adult? Have a think about what you do the most, are you playing sports? Working in an office? Sitting in class? That should give you a little guidance on what you should be putting more of your cash into (if you don't needs shirts but are always in the gym, don't buy shirt but stock up on sports tops and shorts).

For the most part I would say stick to the basics, blue and black jeans will still look good in 3 years, those green bootleg chino's not so much. Stay away from low end replicas, just because your local store sells a version of the the hot new kanye sneaker, doesn't make it worth your money at all.

I would suggest going shopping alone if you are confident about what to wear, or go with a friend with similar style interests if you are unsure. 

Shopping in store will save you a load of time with returns and sizing issues, a M in one store could be an XS in another. But also you get to see it properly, as clothes online can be slightly different in colour and shape depending on the editing and model used. You can defiantly try something on in store then have a look online to see if you can get it at a better price.

One of the things that I do today that I reaaaallly wish someone told me to do when I first started spending money on clothes is, for anything that feels even slightly pricey. Try it on and take a picture of it, then walk out the shop. Wait a week and if you still want it and it still looks good then get it. I have bought soooo much stuff that I loved in the shop, wore it once then never wore it again, and if I waited I would have saved a ton of money.

Lastly if you are buying your own clothes you may be or will soon to be washing your own clothes. Speak to your parents or any responsible adult about how to wash your clothes properly, I was ruined thousands worth of clothes by not washing them properly. If you are unsure always read the label.

Enjoy shopping! And if you have any questions just shout."
"My advice would come down to two things, one of which has already been mentioned:

1. Buy and wear what you like.

2. Buy and wear clothes that are comfortable.

And that's it, really.  Your personal style will develop over time as you do this."
"Make sure it fits right. It‚Äôs never going to look good if it‚Äôs too large/too tight or long/short. If you are unsure where to start begin with something affordable like UNIQLO where you can afford to make a mistake or too. 

Also if you‚Äôve never shopped at a store before don‚Äôt buy 5 or 6 things on your first go, take a few weeks to see how the clothes hold up after a wash or two and if you still like the feel/fit."
"1. Prioritize fit.
2. Qualities ‚â† quality. You can pay a lot for a shirt with good \_qualities\_ (e.g., nice details), but it doesn't mean it is better \_quality\_ than a lesser value shirt. This is not always the case, but it's good to keep in mind. For example, a shirt by Engineered Garments costs $250 and has nice qualities. It is also high quality, but not necessarily 250&#37; more than $100 shirt.
3. Uniqlo and J.Crew and good quality and price (on sale for J.Crew)."
"Don't try too hard. You can be wearing the trendiest outfit in the room, but if you feel uncomfortable everybody will notice. Be yourself and wear whatever you think looks cool. Eventually, you'll develop your own style in confidence."
"Don't cheap out. Buy discounted stuff when it's out of season, but don't go on Amazon and look for $12 shirts. Because... you will get $12 shirts. I would suggest hitting the better brands at the outlet malls once a quarter, looking at the discount rack in the back, and finding stuff you like there. I always make sure I check out Banana Republic and Express, because I always find good stuff on discount sale there.

Buy stuff that fits. If you are skinny, buy slim fit. If you are fat, the buy stuff that won't make you look like an overstuffed sausage.

Don't buy too much all in one go. I am very specific in what I wear in that it's all quite similar, but it took me a while to build out my own personal style. Additionally, nobody needs to own 30 shirts and 50 pairs of pants. I own 10 shirts (5 for summer, 5 for winter), 3 pairs of pants, and some varied outerwear. It all follows a logical, consistent style. Buy one set of items  that fit into an idea you have for what you want to look like, then slowly expand it outward.

Buy the stuff you need. You need more casual and work attire than formal attire, so buy for that."
"1. Dress around your body. E.g. if you're skinny, wear skinny jeans, if your slightly larger than normal, wear blacks and dark colours, if your tall. Avoid vertical stripes.

2. Keep it simple, have some decent plain t shirts, a couple of simple jackets, I personally go for some smart shirts and blazers to layer, meaning you don't need to spend a fortune to have lots of options.

3. Have something for a few different occasions, some smart Oxford brogues and a matching colour belt, polo or shirt with blazer and jeans for smart occasions, night's out, dates, whatever, then some plain t shirts and shirts to layer, to match with jeans and vans or converse for day to day, a cheque shirt is a classic when paired with dark jeans and black vans or white converse (low tops not high tops)

4. Make sure you feel comfortable and confident with whatever you have on, noone looks good if they look awkward or they are constantly having to adjust those jeans that are slightly too big etc.

5. Slogans on t shirts, never.

6. Research some famous looks, take components you feel would suit you and try different looks out, just make sure nothing too crazy, celebrities tend to go over the top, so take what you like and tone it down a little if needed.

7. Know your sizes, get someone to measure your waist, inside leg, chest and nec, if your still growing repeat quarterly.

8. Shop at well know retail places, topman, next, newlook etc, these places generally understand what's currently fashionable, meaning you don't have to.

9. Sign up to some Pinterest fashion posts, check it now and again for the odd thing you like and add it to your roster.

10. The 1st things people (women and your peers) notice is your watch and shoes, these should always be well considered, you no longer have to spend a fortune to get a great timepiece, also keep your shoes clean.

Hope it helps, good luck!"
"If it doesn't fit you well, it's worthless. Unless you can tailor it to fit you well, in which case, it's worthless *until you do that*."
"From the perspective of somebody who didn't have a lot of money to spend growing up but still wanted to get into clothes; when I was first shopping for my own clothes, I spent a lot of time at the H&M's/Old Navy's of the world because I didn't have very much money and I wanted to try different things. 

Obviously, the quality is going to suffer, but as a kid, I didn't know exactly what I wanted to wear, and buying inexpensive clothing let me try different things without having to set myself back financially. Some types of clothes just don't work unless you're willing to put money into them, but I figured out my choice of sweater/t-shirt style/jean cut using fairly inexpensive clothes and have refined my tastes from there on out. 

I wouldn't get too caught up in the brand hunt young, at least before you have a chance to try out multiple styles you're interested in and get an impression of what works for you."
"I would recommend to start investing in staple pieces as soon as you can. Sport coats, jeans, shoes, jackets, heavy coats (especially heavy coats)... I'm never really concerned with having to buy t-shirts again, but I'd be pretty frustrated with having to buy anything from the list above over and over. This is mainly due to price and because I can justify buying one really good thing and having it for years rather than having to buy the same thing year after year. I guess it's personal preference, but the quality is noticeable at that level. Also, buy things you'll wear. I know it seems silly to say, but there are plenty of people out there, including me, that will buy something and never wear it. Don't be like us. Haha. And, lastly, know your styles and fits. You'll be much more confident in clothing when it fits you and when they line up with how you think you should appear to the public. "
"Don‚Äôt chase fad clothing. Make quality purchases (items that won‚Äôt break or wash out after 5 washes). Understood that budgets may be an issue, but the initial higher price is worth the squeeze if you‚Äôre not going to be shopping often. Do your research first and ensure fit/proportions are correct to your body vs what‚Äôs shown on a model"
"The difference between looking good and bad is entirely dependent on fit. I would focus on how the specific items should fit you, and aim for the best of that. Secondly, stick to the classic looks at first that you know you can be versatile with. I typically recommend staying away from trendy items initially, but once you get a good grip on your style you can incorporate small items in. This is mostly to keep your style away from being too trendy, but also shows you keep up with the world. 

Having said that, go buy some cheap shirts at Target. They have Goodfellow & Co has some for 7.99, and has some good jeans/chinos as well. I have not been displeased once with their products and they are cheap, which is perfect if you're just starting to try new looks or build a base while you save money."

"Get a gf. Let her do it. Haha kidding, but it happens..."
"**Fit** makes or breaks the look.

Personal opinion but please, don't show others your underwear. Pull up the pants. "
"1) TRY IT ON! Try everything you purchase instore on, with out exception. Also try on clothes you have no interest in. Often times, something that looks cool on the shelf does not compliment you well at all. On the flip side, sometimes things don't catch your eye initially will surprise you when you put them on. 

2) It can be helpful to take someone shopping with you for feedback and for suggestions that you wouldn't have thought of.


3) The more you spend, the longer it will last *generally*. But that has diminishing marginal returns, so typically the best bang for your buck is mid priced stuff.

4) Start slow and take your time picking things that fit well and can be worn with more than one outfit. I read somewhere on this sub that if you cant think of three outfits you can make out of a piece your considering, then don't buy it.
5) Never pay full price. subscribe to /r/frugalmalefashion . Clothes are always going on sale. There is rarely a time you NEED that piece right this second. When you see something you like, tuck it into your memory bank and keep an eye out for a price drop 

6) Window shop regularly. Go to the mall with no intention of buying anything. Seeing the selection gives you an idea what is in right now. Try it on when you see something you like. That way you know if it what size you see it go for sale online.

7) Read the side bar and refer to it as necessary."
"If you've got the time, check out style blogs, guides, mags and forums like this one right here. Read up on them. Figure out what pieces they consider essential - most will, in fact, have an article/post about THE X ESSENTIAL THINGS EVERY MAN SHOULD OWN IF HE WANTS TO BE A MAN AND COME OF AGE BUYING YOUR FIRST BLAZER IS LIKE SLAYING A WILD BOAR YOU MUST DO IT TO BE ACCEPTED INTO THE MAN-TRIBE. Ahem. Don't fall hook, line and sinker for it. Every one of these people/groups/faceless corporate entities has a signature style - mfa and The Essential Man are mostly basic, hypebeast and r/streetwear like are streetwear, Die Workwear and Mr Porter are classic menswear etc etc.  Figure out what you think about the clothes they talk about. Go outside, and look at people. Who's wearing the ""essentials""? What sort of people are they? Do you want to be (or at least look) like them? 

Good. Keep looking. You'll start to develop an ""eye"" for fashion. Learn to look at outfits, not just individual pieces of clothing; you'll start looking at things you passed over and think about how it would look with what you already own, or would like to own. Look at overall styles, trends, and aesthetics. Think about what *you* would like to look like; do you want to be completely individual, do you identify with a particular subculture, do you just want to fit in and let your personality do the talking? All of these are fine, if you can pull them off.

The people telling you to ""just buy basics"" and ""just wear what you want"" are both right. It's alright to do your own thing, so long as you know what you're doing."
"Pay for your use! Gonna use it many years like s good coach or a watch it doesnt need to be new and hot - buy it on sale.

"Buy your wardrobe in pieces so that you can figure out what you like.

God forbid you drop 600 bucks on a new wardrobe and it turns out you don‚Äôt really like it.

So, with that, but clothes that you can wear over and over and over again and still look good. This usually means something conservative like chinos, jeans, t shirts, polos, button ups.

Stay away from hyper trendy things or graphic tees.

You can wear a white button up a million times and come across as stylish. You can‚Äôt wear that one Supreme shirt a million times without looking tacky."

"Depneding on your age, and how much you have to grow/lose ( height, or working out, weight loss..etc) I would not spend a tremendous amount of money.

Experiment, and make mistakes early and often. I'd rather you make mistakes on things that are cheap and when you young, then to have never experimented and not know what you look good/don't look good in."
"The stuff your mom has been buying is probably too big...  You likely aren't going to ""grow into it"" as you have been lead to believe your entire life.

Fit over everything else.  If you really like the shirt on the rack but the fit isn't right don't buy it.  You will end up not wearing it and it is a waste of money."

"Fit. No matter how good the brand, how great the discount or how cool you think it looks. If it doesn't fit, it's wasted money.

You don't need to splurge to look good. Buy smart, not more.

Learn what can be fixed and what cannot. The shoulders are the hardest and most expensive of shirt fixes. Hemming, taking in the sides and reducing the length of arms (within reason) are not that expensive. The waist of a pair of pants is also hard to fix, length and taper are not.

ALWAYS put your current wardrobe into consideration before you buy anything. You probably don't not need 6 different blue shirts.

You can never go wrong with basics. The basic bastard is pretty decent at pointing these out."
Avoid trends. Don‚Äôt be basic 
"I take a lot of inspiration from other people who's fashion sense I like, whether that be my friends, celebrities, or some dude on the street. I try to put together what I think is cool but reasonable. Start slowly and gradually build a wardrobe that you like as opposed to binging and buying everything you think looks cool and finding yourself with a bunch of clothes you don't really like."

"Not enough mention of this: Read the stuff in the sidebar and the wiki! There's a lot of great info for beginners there, much more than you'll find in the good responses here.

The more time you take gathering info and observing, the less money you'll waste on mistakes or dead ends. Though to be honest, everyone makes those mistakes from time to time when shopping. Also, try a lot of stuff on, even stuff that you thing is bigger or smaller than your size - a lot of beginners have false beliefs about their size, and correcting that is the biggest step toward dressing better!"

"I would think carefully about who you are and what you want your clothing style and approach to be.  Then think about what you actually need and would actually wear.  Not what you think you may like or you might wear, or what someone else says is good.  Personally, I overbought things early on and had grand ideas of how I thought i'd dress, but over the years my style and approach has evolved into something I'm now happy with.  Unfortunately, you'll likely go thru a costly trial period trying to figure out what you like and who you are and it'll probably evolve over time.  You'll likely waste some money, so try to buy used, 'cheap' brands or on sale when you can."

"Perhaps not the advice you want but honest.

We don't really know because we don't know your own style or anything about you.

There are people that can pull off graphic t-shirts without looking like a man child, especially when they put some effort into it.

It also depends on how you groom yourself. Beard? goatee? all of these also impact your style and what you can pull off.

Without actually seeing anything the most I would suggest is:

Go basic and start off with noting too busy. v-necks are nice if you can pull them off and add a sense of style without a lot of effort.

Accessorize: When I'm not working my thing is watches/bracelets, when I am it's bow ties (never pre tied). They again add a little something to your image.

Shoes: Invest a casual pair, a nice pair, and a comfortable pair for walking/hikes. 

Depending on your age you might still grow taller or if you're going to college you can either gain/lose weight (Freshman 15 is not a myth).

Finally: Fitness.

I was incredibly out of shape when I was in high school and carried myself poorly. When I went to post secondary, I started eating better and because I walked everywhere the weight slowly came off. Now I actually work out and my posture has dramatically improved which means I can pull off more clothing styles because I'm not slouching or have man boobs.

Some will fit better and some will fit worse. Clothing exists in a bunch of different shapes. The most average body types will have the most clothing available, though, adjusted a little bit because a lot of brands favor slimmer or more athletic fits."

"True. It's been said that developing personal style is a process of making expensive mistakes. With thrifting, you make *cheap* mistakes. 

The downsides are that it's kinda hard to nail your fit since *everything* is different sizes, and there's an awful, awful lot of crap out there. Check tags for fabric composition, and look up brands you find on the internet."
"The time spent finding your size in a thrift store is better spent elsewhere. Time isn't free, another thing I wish I appreciated when I was younger."
"Eh, depends. I've grown to love some things that I thought were boring, just because I can wear them with pretty much everything in my wardrobe. Similarly, I love a lot of things I don't wear so often because they're a bit out there and only work with a couple of things I own. 

I like flashy stuff like mod shirts and plaid trousers though, so if you luuuurve plain shirts and chinos then go right ahead. If you're talking about statement pieces like hype sneakers and graphic tees, then deffo only get stuff that *speaks* to you."
Wow! Thanks for all of the great advice! 
can you tailor big ass chinos
"> The difference between looking good and bad is entirely dependent on fit.

Bit oversimplified. If your clothes look dumb or you're out of shape, no amount of fit will make you look good."
Is that still a thing? I used to see it alot but not much anymore. Living in NYC if that matters.
"Depends where you live.

Just research the basics and staples for a young mans wardrobe and go from there. Don't buy things that are in, stick to timeless classics, but honestly you'll only look good if you're confident in what you wear.

"
Or copy Armani and just use an all-black uniform
PacSun is pretty crap quality for the price honestly
"the homeless look, like the ripped shit. those super wide pants people seem to be wearing. the whole ankle showing thing. "
Loud prints *ducks in cover*
"Genuine question, what happened with the OCBDs, and will I get a slimmer fitting one if I buy it in Asia?"
Abercrombie and Fitch? Its been a while but I remember it being fairly pricey.
"Buy, just don't *invest*. You need something to wear. Just buy a lot of uniqlo/A&F/cheap stuff."
"yeah, just buy cheap stuff for the time being(at budget stores or thrift stores). my legs aren't even that big, but I have like 8 pairs of pants that don't fit me anymore "
"Bingo.

I got in shape and nothing fits me in Tops. 

One size up it's draping around my midsection.

""Slim fit"" is usually too tight in the shoulders.

One size down it's tight in shoulders and too short in sleeves and length."
"Seriously. Clothing was always difficult for me, as I'm very tall, and naturally skinny. Adding a ten to twelve  inch drop from chest to waist made things much more difficult."
We call him Wally down here in Straya! 
Wally in Britain. I think it's just Waldo in the USA.
Not in the UK he's not.
"Sangiev has a great video on YouTube called ‚Äú5 Steps To Personal Style‚Äù I‚Äôd suggest watching. Really goes into detail about how to really find yourself. My personal taste is everywhere (no shame in rocking an all white outfit, or Green Polo Ralph Lauren Shoes) but it‚Äôs all dependent on your own comfort zone. If you can wear a lot of colours and feel like you‚Äôre rocking it all power to you! If you prefer an ordinary Black & white look that‚Äôs great too! Just don‚Äôt be afraid to experiment and you‚Äôll find the look that really suits you. :) "
"I'd say this is true, especially with items that are super versatile. E.g., I got an aquamarine T-shirt from J Crew factory that I was meh on, but right before I decided to take it back I tried it on with dark-wash jeans and it worked perfectly. You can't bring your whole wardrobe with you, and sometimes you get an item because it's meh but it seems versatile at the time. Only later you might realize that it fills out a specific outfit that you love."
"Maybe, but try a smaller size..."
"I can respect that, I guess I meant that comment under the terms of the rest of my comment though - stick to classic looks initially."
Black is the new black
The stuff you are mentioning have been popular for several years now lol
They changed them from how they used to fit. They are a little more boxy and very long. This makes them look bad untucked. I don't know about if you buy one in Asia.
"Asian here, it's no different. "
they are half off pretty much all the time with extra sales every now and then
"Shop for discounts or clearance. They just had a 70&#37; off clearance yesterday on their site.

I managed to grab a nice sweater from $78 to $16 this way."
"definitely check it out, I just got 5 pairs of shorts for $15 each, and in another order some shorts, swim trunks, chinos, and a linen shirt for $10-14 each. make sure you use the A&F club code, for $20 off $50 on your first purchase. apparently you can reuse this code every time you shop, but with every purchase they send you another code for something like 20% off $50 or $10 off $50, and occasionally you'll get multiple codes that stack. I've just been using those, because apparently some people have been blacklisted after using too many $20 off $50 codes

uniqlo's prices are pretty good without any sales, unfortunately with A&F you have to sometimes wait for a good sale. I have a somewhat athletic build and A&F's shirts and pants work really well for me, but I think uniqlo's t-shirts might fit better. it really varies by item- some stuff from both places fits perfectly and other stuff fits strangely"
"No it's quite cheap on sale. Better quality stuff than Target/H&M too. $20 for stretch jeans is amazing, and the athletic slim/skinny/Rustin/whatever they call it is my favorite. "
Might be an alias he uses so he can be harder to find.
"Sorry didn't know, thought it was only in my language"
"Sorry didn't know, thought it was only in my language"
"Erm, yes he is?"
Yea but I already have a bunch of oversized clothes from when I was a fat fuck
"Doesn't mean it's not a trend, bell bottoms were popular for a whole decade, now look at them"
"Maybe here, but some of it, especially the ankle showing thing have only really just become a ""mainstream"" sort of trend. "
"I used to fit a perfect medium. However, when I tried one on recently, the fit is way too big on me.

Now, I fit a perfect small. Do you think they changed the fit, or the sizing system? 

I always buy a small for button-downs in J. Crew, and now Uniqlos seems to fit relatively similarly."
"In Asia, every item is labeled one size larger. Not too sure about fit though. "
Sounds like a good deal then- I'll check them out one day!
No need to apologise my man. :) 
"Hahaha, no ""sorry"" necessary."
"In the UK it's ""Where's Wally"" not ""Where's Waldo"".

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where%27s_Wally%3F?wprov=sfla1

What a weird argument to be having."
"Ah. Go to a tailor, see what he'll charge you. It might be more expensive than a new pair."
"It's still bizarrely long in my experience, definitely designed for tucking only. "
"They also (mostly) ditched the ostentatious branding. I had really disliked the brand from the moment I first encounter it (15 years ago), so I was pleasantly surprised to see the change and almost bought a few items."
"thought you meant it's not wally , never mind"
sheeeit. Maybe like 20 bucks or something is good idk i never tailored my shit before lol. thanks 
"That indeed. I do like my OCBD‚Äôs a little bit long for more of a drape effect. 

"
"Yeah, it depends how far up you need to slim them. I don't think you'll get waist and ass for under $20 -- those are the trickier adjustments."

"A pretty light-hearted docuseries covering different topics in fashion.  Episodes range from denim and t-shirts to fedoras and suits.  It's hosted by Kyle Ng, founder of Brain Dead.  The overall feel of the series is very hypebeast-y.  Still a fun look and some of you might enjoy it."
"I tried watching this a few weeks ago. I was excited as the first episode was denim and I love me some r/rawdenim but he just glossed over anything useful and the whole episode felt like it was about nothing. 

Never watched the second episode."
"I only know Ng through videos he's made for hypebeast, maybe highsnobiety too iirc? He seems like such an airhead. Honestly not really interested in this show."
"It‚Äôs super cool! The episode on raw denim was very interesting, save for the last segment."
The show probably has a different audience in mind. I agree with you
Hah. I thought the same. Like what did I watch? My fianc√©e was trying to see if I could guess who we was going to talk to when he was talking about an American brand...
"I don't know how I feel about the title here as ""clashing"" as opposed to adventurous color pairings that don't really clash. A lot of those color pairings are very natural. Isn't the word ""clashing"" typically used to reflect a harsh interaction?"
"The writer of this article has a very odd comprehension of the word ""clashing"" and seemingly doesn't understand color theory. Pairing colors with neutrals or two colors that are ADJACENT on the color wheel is NOT clashing them."
"It seems like the author is using the term ""color clashing"" as a manly alternative to ""color coordination"" to open the door for those whose fragile masculinities have been too afraid to go beyond neutrals.  

I don't get why the author references Pitti - *the single most colorful peacock-y-est menswear event* - while citing these *arguably understated* examples as ""a bold new direction""."
"Yes, nothing ""clashes"" so much as is slightly atypical from typical pairings. 'Wear orange with blue hued garments' is not advice on how to mix opposing colours as much as it is a suggestion to try something slightly less ordinary."
Why not boxer briefs?  Best of both worlds.   I like Under Armour. 
Calvin Klein Modal - 3 pack for $25 at Costco 
"Recently picked up a 3 pack of [David Archy Micro Modal Boxer Briefs](https://www.amazon.com/David-Archy-Underwear-Separate-Pouches/dp/B07C38YPTB/ref=pd_sim_193_1?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B07C38YPTB&pd_rd_r=de8236cf-74ad-11e8-8b6c-a104f1cb213b&pd_rd_w=OumL9&pd_rd_wg=EVsyo&pf_rd_i=desktop-dp-sims&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_p=7967298517161621930&pf_rd_r=61JAS2M3MJA9CY26ZXHD&pf_rd_s=desktop-dp-sims&pf_rd_t=40701&refRID=61JAS2M3MJA9CY26ZXHD) and, aside from ordering a size too small (I'm size 30 in pants, but their size M fits me better than S), they're fantastic. 

They breathe wonderfully, and are by far the softest fabric I've ever worn in my life. It feels like nothing at all. Additionally, there are two separate pouches. Not only are your jewels bundled up nicely and not sticking to your thighs, but your 3rd leg is cozied up in it's own compartment. For someone asking for medically-necessary support in that area, I'd highly reccomend giving these a try."
"A little more background: Hey gentlemen, after a visit to my urologist, he recommended that I stop wearing boxers and to start wearing briefs for a while (to help with epididymitis - which can be painful, and support helps with that). Having only ever worn boxers for the last 20 years, it will take some getting used to. What's a good brand of briefs to try that are both supportive (that's key) and really comfortable? Thank you for your help and recommendations!"
See [the recent megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/8sivft/_/) with all of its price bins.
Uniqlo Pima Cotton and Airism boxer briefs are great. Another brand people often swear by are Calvin Klein boxer briefs.
"Ex officio, meundies, saxx are all pretty good imo"
"I only buy made in usa and choctaw ridge (RIP) and ramblers way (basically RIP) were the best i've ever found.   
.   
REI's house brand was made in the USA but switched production overseas in '17.   Depending on the store you go to you can still find them made in usa... even their non-usa version are probably the one i'd recommend most for simple-looking briefs. "
"Kirkland boxer briefs from Costco are extremely affordable, they have very good support, and they don't look ugly."
Ex Officio from Amazon works wonders. Airy yet incredibly comfy. Pills after laundry though.
"[C-in2 ](https://www.c-in2.com/collections/collections/style-briefs), [AussieBum](https://www.aussiebum.com/underwear/billy-brief-black/2179), and  [Under Armour](https://www.underarmour.com/en-us/mens-ua-original-series-printed-boxerjock/pid1307038-473) are my go to brands. If you don't like the brief cut, you may want to try the UnderArmour BoxerJock series. "
"I switched over to wearing nothing but Saxx a few years ago, absolutely love them and their lil sack for you sack. They're a bit pricey though, but have sales every now and then. "
"Hey mate, I feel you. I got a varococele, which hurts to hang. Check out Duluth Bullpen boxer briefs. Saved my life. Or just my nads."
Calvin Klein are my personal favorites for girls and boys alike 
Hanes has some micro mesh boxer briefs that are pretty cheap for the quality. You can get a 4 or 5 pack (i can‚Äôt remember) at target for $15 and I reeeeally like them. 
"Calvin Klein. Always. I only wear Calvin, and there's no other brand I would go for. They've got all shapes, materials, models, colors, everything. Best underwear brand"
"If you want good quality briefs or boxer briefs for a low price, I'd recommend visiting your nearest Ross, TJMaxx, or Marshalls. You can get upscale brands for cheap there. If you do settle with briefs, go for contour pouch. Those are the only kind that won't squish everything together."
"Meundies are pricey, but they are comfortable. Plus some podcasts (joe Rohan, Hannibal Burress) have promo codes to get 20% off. "
"Thanks! Yeah, he suggested something with good support. But I will check Under Armour out!"
Thanks!
Link? 
Thank you!
"Pretty awesome, basically what Sheath offers but 1/3 the price. Thanks!"
"Compression skivvies, under armor"
Thanks!
Thanks!
Thanks!
Thanks!
Thanks for the reply!
Thanks for the reply! Good to know!
Thanks!
Thanks for the reply!
"As a fellow Saxx fan, you should check out Sheath. They‚Äôve got an extra pouch for the main member...no-stick-anywhere."
"Sorry you have that pain. Thanks for the recommendation, I will check those out!"
Thanks!
Thanks for the reply!
Thank you for the reply and the advice!
Thanks!
"Yes, those of us with truly large units must support them properly.  The regular folks just don't understand.  Do you also find that Magnums are just too tight and really hard to get on?  "
"Modal is one of the most comfortable materials I've ever tried, until it gets saturated. At that point the garment will basically never dry out until you take it off so if you have problems with swamp ass, this is not the one to try."
"General internet advice, Google things first then ask if you can't find it. Just to try, I googled ""Calvin Klein modal Costco"" and it's literally the first link."
Thank you!
"Good god man! Thanks to you my twig and berries shall stick no more, curse the DC humidity and heat. I'll definitely check them out, you can never have enough undies"
You Welcome. Socks and underwear are paramount to comfort imo. 
Is this a meme?
Good to know! Thanks for the info!
"I was asking because I was on the Costco site last week and didn't see them.


They are $26.99 now but free S&H

e: I was wrong, I was looking for the mesh CK on Costcos's site and couldn't find them. "
I'm very excited that I was granted the opportunity to go 0-2 in this fit battle. 
[Here's the head to head of main pics](https://imgur.com/a/9jtxBW4). There's plenty of alternate and details so always check those out too!
"Interestingly I find this round to be a touch weaker than the first...Still, there are several close matchup. If anyone cares to read my thoughts, they are here as follows: 

KonnieTheBlack vs CatPee - I do not find either of these fits to my taste, truthfully, but I would select Catpee as I am a fan of his sneakers and must do my dutyto vote against harness boots! 

92414 vs Dom_Kennedy - 92414's fit in this round is undoubtedly my favourite of the battle. This is the perfectly executed fit of the summer, wearing the shirt from ******** that I think perhaps everyone should have purchased! It is well balanced both tonally and visually by sneaker choice. Opponent's fit is conceptually interesting, but visually is a bit off, I think mostly due to the combination of unbuttoned tuck and high trouser waistband. For this reason, I select 92414!

Theteenagegentleman vs Imnotfocusedatwork - An excellent and very evenly matched competition! I am a great fan of gentleman's pinstripe trouser as it seems to bridge a gap between his classic tailoring and modernity that is well balanced with this shirt and excellent trouser rise. Opponent fit is similarly well executed, coordinated, and accessorized - this fit is made in detail, I think! If I must choose, I narrowly select the gentleman, but I do so reluctantly ;) 

Nipplemonger vs Hamish5178 - I am generally a fan of Nipplemonger's fit but am not a great fan of the patterns or fit of the garments as used here...Combined with the white shoes and white t-shirt, they seem somewhat of a stark juxtaposition....Opponent's fit is perhaps a bit slim for my taste, but is supremely well done in photography and execution! Seersucker trousers are a great deal of fun, and tonally very nice with the Wallabees! Thus Hamish is my winner! 


ItalianBelgian vs Bond_Jamesbond - These are both well executed, but I must select Bond_Jamesbond in this case as I feel this is the best fit of his I have seen! This is the perfect fit of trouser for you and tonally this fit seems like it has the possibility to be a final iteration of your aesthetic goals! Bravo. I am a great fan of Italianbelgian's fit as well, but it is simply an unfortunate matchup! 

Rabiddemonweasel vs MrNar - Rabiddemonweasel's fit is supremely well executed and contains several pieces of which I am a great fan....Unfortunately for him he is against MrNar, who I think seems the clear choice to win this entire battle...MrNar's fit is simply sublime as is his photography. I simply do not see how anyone could beat him! ;) 

Blovetopia vs Innerpiece - I did not think today that the most difficult decision I would have to make would be in a battle of fits! Blovetopia's fit is, of course, excellent as usual. Until I had zoomed in, I would have thought him to be the sure winner, but I am enamored with the shorts of Innerpiece! With this jacket this is perfectly executed case of ****************** ********************** ******. Even more closer than the previous battles,  but I must select Innerpiece! 


HonourablyDisagree vs ShitItsTheFuzz - This is a very close battle, I think. Both are rather simple fits that are extremely well executed! I am a great fan of HonourablyDisagree's trousers, and of ItsTheFuzz's shirt....Narrowly, I think I must select my friend HonourablyDisagreee in this battle :) 

Warpweftwatergate vs Chashew - Chashew is wearing a jacket with which I am in love! If I were to think of a garment that was designed for you personally, this would be of what I would think. Opponent Warpweftwatergate's fit is also quite fun, but looks just slightly off to my eye due to combination of navy trouser and black t-shirt! I am sorry Warpweftwatergate my friend, but this round is for Chashew! 

bmash vs smurfminiman - Smurfminiman's fit is essentially perfectly executed, except for matchiness of socks and sweater, but somewhat lacking in imagination....I find the interaction of Bmash's parka and shawl lapels to be just the slightest bit odd, but overall am a great fan of this fit, due in large part to an admitted weakness for big white coats ;)

Now that I know how to edit I have added my thoughts on few fits I missed!: 

KamoteJoe vs TheGreatOne3476 - Oh my, I do not know how I could have missed this! Both of these fits are extremely well done, with KamoteJoe beautifully coordinating pattern amongst these various pieces, and radiating undeniable sense of cool! TGO's fit is slightly more interesting in execution and silhouette to my eye (though I am not sure it would be so had you not included that motion picture!) and thus I must narrowly, narrowly select him as my winner! 

SonofJacobs vs PrimeVeridian - Though simple, I must select SonofJacobs again as my winner, as I simply do not think anyone executes fit as well as he. SonofJacobs I do wish you to know that if you continue in this tournament, I may not continue to vote for button down on top of shirt ;) ;) "
italianbelgian vs bond__jamesbond is hard 
"/u/rektunicorn - You went hard against probably the one with the coolest wardrobe. REALLY well done. 

/u/konnietheblack - whoever your photographer was, keep em. That alternate photo belongs in a magazine

/u/k1ngkhan - Love your fit and the memery of the details pic is amazing. 
"
"I'm starting to believe this entire thing is just a way for /u/Smilotron to farm karma.

In all seriousness this was a really great and close round, I think we might see some of the heavy hitters go out "
/u/k1ngkhan trying to meme his way to victory
"PANTSLESS STANDOUT FITS IN NO PARTICULAR ORDER

* Mr. Nip holy shit! I love the way the light cascades down your pants
* Blove dropped an absolute banger. Those pants are amazing.
* Rektunicorn's cohesion is great, love the noragi (?)
* I think my favourite pictures this whole round is a tie between smurfminiman's alt pic and konnie's alt
* italianbelgian and bond look like they're on their way to meet each other at a beach-side business meeting
* KJo vs TheGreatOne is a great matchup. KJ's mix of patterns is great and I love all the little details, but TGO's whole ensemble works so well
* HonourableyDisagree and theFuzz both dropping mad summer vibes
* KignKhan keeping the sports theme!"
"these are my thoughts on the matchups (my opinions on who SHOULD win, not necessarily who will):

* konnie v catpee - konnie is probably winner here, even if unremarkable and a rehash of past fits.  it could be freezing where catpee is, but a jacket over a hoodie seems like an odd pick for a summer fit battle.  konnie's layering at least seems to make some sense.

* innerpiece v blove - closer than i thought, mainly because blove's fit feels like it's missing an overshirt or light layer up top to balance out the pants with the potato sack drawstring.  innerpiece's may be a bit of a yawn comparatively, but i like it.  well executed, though it's mildly disappointing that he bought common projects.  i still pick blove.

* nipplemonger v hamish - probably surprises me the most with my vote.  i would have blindly picked nipplemonger, but i like hamish's more.  i think it's the double pattern of nipplemonger's that i'm not sold on.  it makes me think about my grandmother's drapes (but i usually think about those regardless).  NO ONE has used seersucker (fact check please) in this tournament, and hamish seemed to nail a perfect summer fit with with the wallabees.  nipplemonger's was more adventurous, to be sure, but i give the nod to hamish.

* changbang v filthy casual - i will stick by my pick of changbang winning.  filthy casual looks like he didn't try at all.  feels like i'm watching an old navy commercial.  changbang...don't really know what to say.  pretty safe techwear fit i guess, but sometimes it's kind of hard to know what the hell you're doing.  feels like i'm watching chameshi nampa try every style under the sun.  i would pick chang here.

* rektunicorn v clothesonwhite - rektunicorn.  seems to be a cool guy, makes his own shit, rarely falters on his outfits.  probably performing at his PEAK right now.  clothes on white fit not bad but pales in comparison to most of his other outfits.  let's just say white got rekt.

* sonsofjacob v prime viridian - jacob is growing into a real man with that chin stubble, although this fit leaves a little bit to be desired, especially from a youngster with so many textural options in his armoir.  prime viridian though--good until you hit the shoes!  take your hands out of your pockets, first of all.  switch to some espadrilles or strap sandals or anything else.  i don't care.  jacob wins even if he hit the safe button.

* bmash v smurf - if i told you bmash would wear black derbies, black cropped pants, and tuck a black shirt into those pants, would you believe me?  i like the color of smurf's sweater, and so that wins in this otherwise-monotonous romp.

* bond v belgian - sometimes bond looks cgi to me.  his head looks like a lego movie character here, but this outfit is what i need MORE OF! bond looks great here, and i would love to take a sniff of him up close.  belgian though is the man.  he's super relaxed and is on his goddamn yacht off the fucking coast of naples.  belgian carry me home 

* teengent v notfocused - tough!  i picked teengent to win the whole enchilada, but notfocused really came through in color, accessories, fit, everything.  and he's very handsome.  i am going to go AGAINST my champ and vote for notfocused.

* chashew v warpweft - i am voting chashew here.  nice 80s outfit for sure.  he's really out of place in this decade imo.  i think warpweft has had many better outfits than this one, though i'm pleased to see mustard getting its rightful due this s/s.

* chameshi v pisoff - chameshi oh no what the fuck did you do man.  this looks like something shaney would throw together.  cannot get behind it.  pisoff's fit is neither here nor there...page 38 of your typical j crew summer catalog.  i'll vote for him i guess.

* kamotejoe v tgo - this would be a hard one i knew.  however, it wasn't in the end.  kamotejoe is the easy winner here.  his stuff has becoming boringly spectacular because we all know he'll do something creative and succeed (though maybe not [ALWAYS](https://i.imgur.com/isD2jLl.jpg)).  tgo sorry man, you look like snufkin's assistant, using your satchel to store his freshly-caught brook trout.

* dom v 92414 - dom got lucky here.  not what i've come to expect from the fellow and a beatable showing, but 92414 reusing this fit is DETRIMENTAL!  i don't assess his chances as positive.  i pick dom

* rdw v mrnar - i pick nar here.  the denim with the patches work exceptionally well in a sea of white. i think he could have gone all white here, but it may have been too easy.  rdw's is not bad but not tourney worthy imo.

* filth v khan - these guys are both so good looking i'm not sure what i should do, frankly.  filth has been a great addition to this sub because no one can really replicate his style with the same degree of ease.  he's very much like dom in that regard.  i enjoy seeing his stuff each week, so he will be my choice.  that's not slight to khan, who made a very nice showing on his own.

* honorably disagree v fuzz - another toughie. i am surprised that hd brought such a nice showing with those wonderful pants.  i'll give him the nod because i like the seasonal components of his outfit a bit more."
Whoa face reveal for /u/CatPee? Man this feels like a GW moment or something.
"Even if KamoteJoe doesn't win, at least he'll have his own paramilitary group to fight against the filthy democratic voting system!"
"* **KonnieTheBlack vs CatPee** - meh, I flipped a coin and CatPee won. 

* **blovetopia vs innerpiece** - I'm really not a fan of Blove's shirt, give the win to innerpeice. 

* **hamish5178 vs nipplemonger** - Double patterns is too much for me but it's streets ahead of the a very boring fit - Nipple Monger wins.

* **thechangbang vs filthy_casul** - I'm feeling the Summer with Filthy's fit - Filthy_casul wins. 

* **ClothesOnWhite vs rektunicorn** - I can't believe I'm going to vote for a white guy in a noragi but I'm going to - Cultural appropriation FTW.

* **sonsofjacob vs Prime-Viridian** - They're linen pants, why are they so tight? Sonsofjacob wins.

* **smurfMiniman vs bmashh** - bmash wins but I'm not crazy about it.

* **italianbelgian vs bond__jamesbond** - Both of these are really nice. Give it to Bond, but it's a tough choice.

* **theteenagegentleman vs imnotfocusedatwork** - Very strong showing from imnotfocusedatwork. I'm calling the upset and takes down the teen who is lost in a different generation.

* **warpweftwatergate vs Chashew** - Pretty good fits all around. That jacket rocks, Chashew with the win.

* **PisOff vs chameshi_nampa** - Chameshi_nampa is missing the mark on techwear here, PisOff wins. 

* **KamoteJoe vs thegreatone3486** - In the battle of blurry photos I give the win to KJ, although it is a very close race.

* **dom_kennedy vs 92414** - Both well executed, San Berdadino's zip code wins because those shoes are cool. 

* **rabiddemonweasel vs MrNar** - Favorite battle, MrNar wins a very tight race. Can I pick one of you over Konnie vs. CatPee?

* **filthxcollins vs K1NGKHAN** - mustache & tiny stool > soccer ball in the battle of accessories. filthxcollins wins.

* **honourably-disagree vs ShitItsTheFuzz** - STRIPE BATTLE FUCK YEA. Both great fits, slight edge to ShitItsTheFuzz.

Thanks for playing. "
"/u/thegreatone3486 I tip my beret to you, may the best man win!"
"Based on all the feedback on here, maybe I should've just worn suits the entire time lol.

Good shit u/imnotfocusedatwork . Love the colors and the details! "
"Overall I really appreciate the diversity of fits here. Fashion can sometimes be thought of as something to conform to, at least I saw it that way earlier in life. It's good to know that isn't always the case. Here are my picks and some musings.

KonnieTheBlack vs CatPee -There was something off about the jacket in each picture. Each vibe was unique but I'll give this to KonnieTHeBlack

blovetopia vs innerpiece -Innerpiece by the shorts, they were deceptively unique.

hamish5178 vs nipplemonger -hamis5178. Clark wallabies and seersucker is a combo I never thought of

thechangbang vs filthy_casul -I chose the changbang here, but I wonder if other sneakers would be better. Both pictures were great examples of the outfit going with the environment.

ClothesOnWhite vs rektunicorn - ClothesonWhite here, man what does your wardrobe look like? 

sonsofjacob vs Prime-Viridian - Sonsofjacob. Loose but not too loose. Everything lays and flows well.

smurfMiniman vs bmashh - bmashh by the shoes. To me, they seemed more of a statement than on smurfMiniman.

italianbelgian vs bond__jamesbond - Italianbelgian something about the outfit works here, I can't place my finger on it.

theteenagegentleman vs imnotfocusedatwork - imnotfocusedatwork's jacket. Man. Nicely don.e

warpweftwatergate vs Chashew - warpweftwatergate's yellow shirt and the mustache are weirdly juxtaposed.

PisOff vs chameshi_nampa - Gotta vote when someone brings out their inner chad.

KamoteJoe vs thegreatone3486 - KamateJoe here. Literally hat and shoes of the same color and everything else something wilder.

dom_kennedy vs 92414 - dom_kennedy  very thematic the whole way through

rabiddemonweasel vs MrNar -I know I'm in the minority here but those shoes--> rabiddemonweasel  

filthxcollins vs K1NGKHAN - The battle of the object you rest your foot on. The jacket swung my vote to K1NGKHAN

honourably-disagree vs ShitItsTheFuzz - ShitItsTheFuzz. Again the shoes did it for me."
/u/pisoff starting with preacher curls and finishing with hammer curls for that pre-photo op pump. 
"Very good round gentlemen. A lot of people stepping up their game as the competition drags on. I love the creative push fit battle brings out. Some of my favorites are Blove, CoW, Rekt, Imnotfocused, and KJ v TGO is insane. /u/sonsofjacob, well met and let the best man win! "
/u/konnietheblack \-- where the hell did you go to take those photos?
"Love the quality of fits in this round. Closest matchups imo were White vs Unicorn, Joe vs TGO, Nar vs Weasel, and Hamish vs Nip. The ***** brogues and shawl-like coat that bmashh wore both looked amazing, but don't think the jacket fits with the rest. Dom vs 92414 was interesting as well given how stylistically different the two outfits were. I think Dom will win because his outfit appeals to the MFA community, but 92414's fit is really good in the space of summer streetwear. I'm also a big fan of the fits by Fuzz and focusedatwork"

"Yeah tbh I took a long time picking out the right sneaker, but ultimately I would have made the wrong decisions with some of the slimmer silhouettes I was considering (vapormax, NMDs, Flyknit Trainers). I kept going back to a chunkier running shoe. Decided my Karhus were too dark/colorful/flashy in the summer and with the Earth tones I'm mostly wearing, so I settled on the lighter grey sneakers you see in the fit."

"Retail price is the same as SLP on sale season (at least in my experience) so I don‚Äôt really see them as a good choice unless:

-	Your size is very popular and sells out pretty fast
-	You want the classic styles or colours that are only available through resellers/grailed/ebay


Also, the lion suede colour looks the same as SLP‚Äôs cigarette suede, wish they would‚Äôve gone with their camel colour so it would look more like the ochre wyatts from 2013. That would‚Äôve made them an instabuy for me"
Hows the arch support and gait of these?
Price on these?
Something great about SEF: They created their goodyearwelt line boots. 
Thanks for sharing! Interesting that you ordered a half size down compared to SeF. I'm size 38.5 for SeF but the smallest size for FtF was 39 so I ordered that. Hope it isn't too big!
They look great judging by this and the other review of this brand. I would've gotten a pair if I didn't got some slp and sandro boots on discount. 
I could never pull these off but they look fantastic!
You pull off the Chelsea very well. Great looking boots! 
"We'll drop the Luca in the camel suede option shortly. Lion was a limited edition colorway that'll feature in our Chelsea boot lineup soon enough.

Honestly though, if people want to wait and buy SLP in the sale season or used on Grailed etc then that's cool, but we're another good option for people. Most of our styles and sizes are in stock, we have a good range of boots (who else makes a decent 40mm fringe boot?!) and the price is very fair for the quality which people are learning. We know our stuff and we're here to stay, not just another fly by night ""brand""."
"That's the point. The popular SLP models sell out very fast. The Wyatt and side zip are ones that sell out very fast and you'd be very lucky and reliant on luck to find deals. 

If you buy these, and they apparently are very similar in quality and makeup, you don't have to worry about deal hunting thag consumes your attention, for weeks or months. And no worries they'd be sold out. 

Also I want to point out: your size is very popular and the style is very popular. You mean the vast majority of shoes that are sold? I could probably buy a red python Wyatt in size 14 for 70% off, but that's also not what most people are looking for. "
"I think the attraction is having a similar boot readily available,

Finding my size in both the boot and colour I want on a sale is both unlikely and time consuming, it‚Äôs just not worth it to me

These boots are perfect as an alternative"
I'll probably have to buy Santiags off these guys seeing as SL don't make them any more and there are none in decent condition in my size on grailed. 
"Apologies, I'd responded with my alt account haha,

I have a pretty standard instep so didn't think to include it in my review as it's not something I've had to worry about when buying boots in the past, but these have been incredibly comfortable, even after being on my feet all day. I'm not sore or anything once I take them off."
"I've added to the original post, that's what I get for not proofreading -

They retail at ¬£350, but there was a 10&#37; discount code floating around when I ordered which brought the price down to ¬£315"
"You‚Äôre right, all the Made to Order lines for SeF are Good Year Welted, however honestly I think that throws the silhouette out. The way blake welts disappear under the arch gives the boot it‚Äôs sleek look,

I‚Äôd rather wear the Blake Stitched RTW story et fall stuff than the good year welted MTO Boots"
"Yeah, the KTT thread for SeF generally recommend going half a size up because of how slim the shaft is

Hope you enjoy them as much as I do! I have my second pair coming in tomorrow so I‚Äôll do another review type thing for them some time next week"
"They‚Äôre definitely my new favourite boots

Oooh how come?"

Being pedantic though, these aren‚Äôt Chelsea‚Äôs, they‚Äôre sidezips, but From the First are adding Chelsea‚Äôs to their line up soon which I‚Äôm looking forward to"

Amy plans for a Cuban heel boot?

I think that would make me consider buying from you, it would also be great if you offered jodhpurs "
"Okay. Got ya. I wonder where they get their suede from? SWF gets theirs from CF Stead. 

I don't think it's like either owner are shoemakers. It's not like the case like woth beckett simonon or grant stone's founders who are from a lineage of shoemakers (Nicholas' family owned an Argentinian shoemaker that has 60 years of history, and the father of the GS founder was at Alden for over half a century). These two are both fashion fans from what I know making shoes with shoemakers. So I wonder how they're limited in that regard. "
"> The way blake welts disappear under the arch gives the boot it‚Äôs sleek look

This."
"I mean, I got some slp and sandro on discount so not needing another pair. But they look great!"
"40mm Chelsea boots dropping next week. Embrace the extra 10mm, we'll never do a 30mm heel as there's so little difference. "
They‚Äôve mentioned plans for a cowboy boot which will probably be very similar to SLPs Santiag
"Haha I know, the owner of SeF lives in Sweden and boots are made in Vietnam, FtF lives in the UK and boots are made in Italy

Not sure where they source the suede from or how they‚Äôre limited, it‚Äôs an interesting question for sure"
"Well hey lucky you!

Thank you, got my second pair coming tomorrow, fucking hyped."
Fair point on the 10mm difference! I‚Äôll be on the lookout next week!
"Im just interested in why you would say they're better. CF Stead suede is suppose to be very very good. 

Yeah. I mean distance isn't necessarily a problem but more if they have the knowledge of shoemaking. Rick owens said in an interview that if you want to make clothes, learn how to make them by your own hands first. Not from a sketchbooks. So I think the same applies for shoemaking with all the nuances in how shoes are made. 

That's why the recent stories of story et fall being bad for gait came out. 

But to their credit from the first do seem to want to find factories that would be up to their stansards. So maybe they found one that's just really good at what they do. "
Did you post this at /r/goodyearwelt yet?
"> But to their credit from the first do seem to want to find factories that would be up to their stansards. So maybe they found one that's just really good at what they do. 

Completely agree with Rick on that. Get hands-on and learn your trade, don't just trust the factory, learn from them and always ask questions.

Yeah, the factory we use in Italy is family owned and run for over 40+ years so they know their stuff. We visit at least twice every 6 months to check on production etc. They're great at what they do and nearly everything we need to get the final product is produced locally, even down to the box!"
"The suede is softer to the touch and the hairs (not sure if that‚Äôs the right phrasing) are longer which gives it a texture that the SeF boots lack (though that would be personal preference I suppose)

Yeah I agree - not sure on either owners background, just know where they live and where the factories are located at the minute haha"

I've recently subbed here and am trying to improve my overall appearance. I have picked out a few new articles of clothing that I like, however, I'm finding a common problem with shirts.

I'm on the short side around 5'7"" but slim with broad shoulders. So I'm in between most medium and large sized shirts. The issue is that large shirts tend to be too baggy, where as medium shirts fit well to my body except tight in my shoulders.

For now I've gone with mostly mediums because shirts look better more slim fitting even if it's tight in my shoulders.

Is there anything I can do about this? Are there some brands that may fit better for me?

"I don't have specific recommendations, but my advice is casual/dress wear socks can be the same. Just stick to a solid color, no pattern, and get numerous pairs of the same sock. Navy is a good option, but it really depends on what pants you have.

Exercise socks should really be their own separate kind of socks. "
"I have five pairs of socks, all from Darn Tough:

* one no-show
* one black
* one charcoal
* one brown
* one brown with some pattern

That basically covers everything. Those socks last long enough that I can send, say, the grey ones in to be washed and wear the black ones in the meantime (I only have the one pair of no-show because I wear sandals a lot). I've only recently gotten any pants in navy, so I might add a pair in that color.

Exciting? No. But it covers everything."
"Probably darn tough.

But look into other casual socks from this thread: [https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/8y041c/your\_favorite\_for\_socks/](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/8y041c/your_favorite_for_socks/?ref=share&ref_source=link)"

LL Bean has some great boot socks and thick wool socks as well.
You don't need your belt to match your sneakers. Stick with brown leather. There's a belt thread that showed recommendations for different price points that came up recently here.
I don‚Äôt really have a feeling one way or another about grey belts bro.  I wouldn‚Äôt go too matchy matchy myself but it‚Äôs not a major concern since from the sounds of it you won‚Äôt be tucking in your shirt anyway lol
"We generally don't recommend dress shoes that cheap -- they're usually going to wear very fast and just aren't very well made. Most dress shoes will also be at least a little uncomfortable if you wear them a whole day long.

It seems that those clarks are wingtip bluchers, with... contrasting white sneaker soles. So they're only kinda dress shoes.

If comfort is more important than getting a decent quality dress shoe, maybe try Cole Haan on sale... But again, don't get the ones with the thick, ugly contrasting sneaker soles, those are terrrribleeee."

No noticeable shrinkage for me. Avoid machine drying them and you'll be fine.

Is there a general style you're going for?"
I think you are looking for a bauhaus style watch.  Most of these style watches are pretty comparable in the low-mid end.  They are pretty much all going to be meh quality and quartz movement.  I would just pick based on aesthetics as opposed to looking for some heirloom piece because you aren‚Äôt going to find it until you get up into the more baller German brands.  I think skagen is a good shout and also braun is worth checking out.

Pleats will really help with thigh room
Do you know what the temp and weather of the new area you are moving too is like?
"I guess if you're moving to a new area, you'll figure it out pretty quickly. Like everything else it's highly dependent on your personal preference and where you live. I'm not much of a short person, and even when I lived in really hot and humid weather, I still wore jeans most of the days. NY summers are fairly warm, but I stick to mostly wearing jeans on most weekend outings, with a few pairs of shorts thrown in for really hot days.

For tops, I try to stick to tees during the hot days for most casual activities. I love dressing up or down tshirts, so I have different tees at different qualities and price points. Tees are easy to wear, easy to change (if you sweat too much, but can't shower just yet, just swap out tees), and really versatile.

For summer dinners or events, I try to stick with linen shirts for the breathability. Linen shirts and dark wash jeans that can be dressed up or sometimes chinos if it calls for that. 

Footwear is basically different pairs of sneakers during daytime, and chukkas or loafers for more formal events. I'm not much of a sandal wearer outside of the home, so I stay away from that. Also sandals in NYC is gross.

Finally, summer calls for a lot of headwear, mostly baseball caps. I'd love to venture out sooner or later, but this is the best time to bring out sun related accessories like hats and glasses."
"Don't know about that hat in particular, but wool hats can be stretched. Your local hat shop might do that for you, or you can buy one of these: Killer Hats Heavy Duty Hat Jack Hat Stretcher, Large-7 1/2 and Up https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001XON4E6/"

"I would wear some kind of a beanie, not a bandana. Or hats, when outside."
Looks pretty versatile to me. 
"Jeans I think would be fine, but I would be worried that with Navy chinos/slacks it may look like an ill matching suit"
"You're not going to find anything known for durability at that price. That's basically the very minimum possible price for a shirt. Look around at thrift stores and sale sections at stores like Uniqlo. Make sure to wash your shirts on cold and hang dry them, which will lengthen their lifespan a lot."
uniqlo‚Äôs are $30 but on sale can be had for 19.90
"I've gotten some stuff I think around that price range from Kohl's that's not too bad.

If you go up to $30 though and are patient you can get stuff from Charles Tyrwhit that'll be much better. Be aware that their slim is more of a regular fit; you'll want the extra or super slim."
"You gotta get out and try some stuff on.  Just googling 'Fashion for Guys built like Andy from Pawnee' won't be enough.  Read through [this fit guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/ehrtv/shujins_comprehensive_fit_guide/) then go and try a ton of stuff on.  Different guys will carry their fat on different parts of their body.  Also not all overweight but not fat people have the same style. Everything is about how the garment fits your own body.  Grab a bunch of cuts and similar sizes, maybe a size up, maybe a size down, and just see what is comfortable.  If it looks baggy or flowy maybe opt for something cut a bit tighter.  If you are completely unsure you can snap some pics and post in the Feedback and Fit check thread.  "
Just let them dry out and give them a brush with the suede brush.  Don't sweat it too hard.  Maybe keep some shoe trees in them if you have them. 
Suede is pretty tough. People online makes it seem like it's tissue paper.
Those honestly serve a couple different purposes. I have a pair of Nike Free x Metcon that may run that line. They're super comfortable.
COS has had some in the past. Maybe check them out. I've also gotten one from Muji before.
If you can wait on a sale or go for factory seconds you would probably like Allen Edmonds dalton boot.  They‚Äôll be repairable going forward as well.
"It's fine to wear them, yes."
"Maybe search printed/print shirts. That might pull up something, but it's a very niche aesthetic. Brands like Undercover and Raf Simons have had plenty of prints on their shirts, but that's quite pricey."
what music video is it from?
That looks pretty jank.
"Very odd. Considering it's supposed to be like the stitching on the bottom boot, I would ask Wolverine about getting them replaced."
Look like seconds to me. Shouldn‚Äôt be an issue with durability since plenty of shoes do not have stitch channels but that along with the mark in the welt would get me to exchange if these were bought as firsts. 
"For an undershirt, a deeper v works well, in a color similar to your skin tone."
"more about the undershirt than the shirt itself, though both obviously do play a factor. Wear a tighter undershirt maybe, or if you really don't want it to be visible, tape that shit down..."
Thicker fabric would help. Do you wear under shirts?
"I have puffy ones from gynecomastia in puberty, so I know your pain sort of"
"Thicker isn't necessarily higher quality, just different. Try to stay with oxfords and twills rather than broadcloth and poplin, that should help."
Air Force 1s are dope but if you‚Äôre asking this they probably aren‚Äôt for you.
Stans are about as versatile as it gets. 
"The only pointer I'd give is this: Stan Smiths are slimmer and sleeker. They look normal with any cut of trousers. Air Force 1s on the other hand are bulkier and chunkier, which, in my opinion at least, means no skinny or slim trousers, they really work better with slightly looser trousers. So definitely think about what your style of trouser is, but as u/PaidRubenShill said, if you're asking, they're probably not for you..."
"They are sanforized and have recieved a wash already at the least (unless you're buying raw) so they shouldn't shrink any at all. 

If they are raw, expect around an inch in the waist and up to two in length."

"Yes on the business environment.

Ah, it's kilted...

I'd probably keep them to non-suit scenarios -- a traditional tassel loafer can work with a suit, but the kilt adds a serious element of goofiness... I'm generally not a fan of them in the first place, but I'd keep them to the plain business use."
"If breathability is your concern, then I would say that swapping them for the canvas ones would be best."
"Yes, that is fine."
Totally fine bro.
Yes i do this
"Something light and simple like linen trousers and a linen shirt of some sort. Maybe some seersucker. Loafers or white bucks or something simple like this for shoes. 

I dont exactly go to ""raves"" or anything though, but do go to outdoor live music events often."
"I would definitely say no loafers or bucks, and probably no linen or seersucker, because most festivals you'll get dirty. I'd suggest simple sneakers like vans or converse, something cheap that you won't mind getting dirty, and some shorts and a tee shirt, or shorts and a printed shirt of some kind. Bum bags or fanny packs are also my go to, because you don't want your shit to get stolen. Obviously, if you go to more calm and mature festivals, go with their advice. "
"Converse 70s lows, shorts, and a linen popover. Cheap and breathable.

I don't really hate seeing any particular clothing items there, except maybe fursuits."
"I don't really pay attention to other people but if I'm at an outdoor concert when it's hot I'm probably looking at some canvas sneakers, shorts, and a tank. It's a concert. Gotta be laid back and enjoy it."
What's your budget 
adidas stan smith
"They're a half-step up in formality, but how about [these](https://www.meermin.es/en/unlined-string-loafer)?"
"Much more expensive, but Common Projects Achilles Lows are completely worth the price. They'll last you forever, and if you make sure to wipe away dirt every day, or every time they get dirty, they'll look pristine for years. If you don't want to spend retail, you can find some colors on sale, or you can find slightly used pairs on Grailed or something for a good price as well. Even if you buy them after their previous owner had them and wore them for a year, if they were kept in good condition, they'll still last you forever."
"Linen is inherently breezy, so if you live somewhere tropical where it's warm all the time it would be fine in winter, but if you live somewhere cold you'll be miserable once you're outside. I'm sure you can find flowy pants in wool or cotton, but you may just have to wait a bit longer until stores introduce their FW collections."
"I sweat a good deal as well. First of all, for suits, especially if you'd like to be more adventurous, get a seersucker or linen/linen blend suit. Second of all, Uniqlo has great AIRism undershirts, very breathable and lightweight, but will keep that sweat from drenching your shirt or jacket. Changing at work is a decent strategy if it's really too hot. And if you can get away with it, maybe ditch the suit jacket for most of the day, maybe get some suspenders or a nice tie to still keep it interesting and formal. Get a mini fan at your desk to cool you off. Lastly, make sure you are also wearing a lightweight shirt, and get your trousers in a wider/looser cut, to help your legs breathe. And for real lastly, depending on how strict your dress code is or if you think you can pull it off, try some slightly cropped trousers and no socks, maybe with crisp white sneakers to ventilate the ankles and lower legs and feet. "
"Have you tried Botox yet?

Also antiperspirant on you back and pretty much wherever. 

That said, get your suits half lined. Go with lightweight 3 season fabrics as well. 

Finally keep a stash of undershirts at the office."
That is fine.
their size chart offers chest and arm measurements. Compare against those.
"Definitely get a medium if you're 5'10"", I'm TTS medium, and I'm like 5'9"". Also, if you want that slightly oversized fit, not too much, I'd even say consider a large. In my experience, Carhartt doesn't run that much too big, it's basically negligible. And of course, if you really can't decide, order both sizes and return the one you don't want..."
Have your tailor remove the belt loops and add side tabs
I would just wear a belt. 
"If you're wearing a suit you can also try suspenders/braces (proper ones, with buttons)"
Don't know much about the others but I have the 70s and they are really good quality. Much better than converse 1s if you could get 70s on sale I'd say jump on it

Ideally, you'd get a green suede belt to pair with that, but blue or brown suede will do in a pinch... or anything but black leather.

There's some bunching going on behind the neck which is probably a result of the sleeve pitch being off compared to your natural posture. A tailor could adjust by taking some material out of the collar, or completely repitching the sleeves.

That said, it looks like it has some structure to it. And the two pockets on the left breast break up the vertical dimension a bit. So it's not for every body type. Are you tall? Short? Skinny? Fat? Wide? Muscular? This looks like this would be ideal for a tall guy who wants to look wide and rugged, but can't quite pull it off without a little extra structure."

"Throw that red shirt away. Wear a white/light blue/pastel shirt, and don't wear a tie unless you're wearing a jacket. The black pants aren't ideal (though ok I guess, especially if you go with a white shirt), tan/navy chinos or grey dress pants would be better.

All or any of those things, if you buy, you'll probably have the opportunity to wear again. "
What kind of fine dining restaurant?

"It's pretty difficult to find ultra narrow soles on sneakers. Hugo Boss and Lanvin have a few models with slim soles. From personal experience, the slimmest soles I've even seen on a sneaker were on D&G & CNC high-tops, Y-3 Kazuhiri and on their boxing-low range. Generally, Italian brands go for the slimmer soles. See Carshoe, even some from Cesare Paciotti, for example.

"In a situation like this, not even an extra-strength antiperspirant deo spray will help. You need a special treatment for sweating. I use Driclor solution and it's worked wonders for me. Apply before bed time on (VERY IMPORTANT) perfectly cleaned and dried pits. Beware: it will sting like a m\*\*\*\*\*\*ucker. Sleep without a t-shirt on. In the morning wash off with soap and water then restart applying normal deodorant (minimum strength is ok at this point).

Not much to worry about except to lean towards straighter cuts rather than slim or tapered. You might consider pleats on occasion. Tailors can take a waist in 1-2‚Äù if you need to size up.

"Red's simply too severe a color to have as a dress shirt. It'll look tacky and trashy. The closest I'd go for are maybe a burgundy casual shirt, or a very light, basically pink dress shirt. Notice how both are softer colors. "
"Dress shirts are meant to be tucked in, so have a longer length. Often also a bit of a scoop hem. Casual shirts that are not meant exclusively for tucking in are shorter, sometimes a straight hem, sometimes slightly scooped. If you're in college and aren't getting this shirt for formal attire, get a casual shirt. It should be shorter to begin with, but if it's still too long, a tailor can shorten it for very little. Lastly, there are some really nice boxier shirts with a bit of a cropped body, Prada makes some, but if you're not looking to spend that much money, you may have some luck looking through ASOS or Zara, especially if you want some type of print.

"1) Shoe creams add moisture to shoes and nourishes it kind of like leather conditioner, but it also has a layer that adds color (which can hide light/shallow scratches and scuffs) and adds that polished shine which helps makes it water resistant. If you want to add better water resistance, you‚Äôre better off with shoe wax, which has a higher concentration of wax that helps not only with shine, but sealing it from the elements.

2) Saphir if you want to opt for higher end wax/cream, Kelly‚Äôs shoe cream/wax polish for a  cheaper option. Kiwi wax is also a good option.

Some shoe creams/waxes come with a sponge applicator. All you would have to do is dip the sponge into the cream and apply the cream to the shoe in circular motions. If your cream/wax doesn‚Äôt include a sponge, using a clean rag to apply your cream/wax works well too.

After that, you would use a horsehair brush to buff the shoe so it‚Äôll develop a nice shine. Wipe off any excess wax/cream with a rag.

"What do you mean general statement?

I guess it's general in the way that in most situations where black pants are appropriate, they're better substituted with something else. They're simply harder to pair, harder to pull off, and like a red shirt, more severe and potentially cheap-looking. The other options are easier to wear, more versatile in both formality and colors, yet actually interesting looking.

">Right, but when I say height as a measurement obviously that's referring to body length and sleeve length. 

But...

>Definitely get a medium if you're 5'10"", I'm TTS medium, and I'm like 5'9

So... no.

>Depending on your height, your body length and sleeve length will be affected. 

Vaguely. But it's perfectly plausible for one person at 5'9"" to wear a 32"" sleeve, and another to wear a 36"" sleeve. More important, it's downright *likely* for their sleeve and body lengths to vary by an inch, which is a full size difference in length. Actually, sizes here are separated by 1cm sleeve and 1.5cm body -- less than an inch. Any guesses you make here on improper measurements are crazy likely to be incorrect.

The more significant differences in these sizes relate to chest size. I'm not aware of any correlation at all between height and chest size, but, presumably, it's a very loose correlation. You talked about being ""decently slim,"" which is crazy if you were talking about chest sizes.

So again: height is not size. Height is not a clothing measurement. Weight is not a chest size or a fit or really anything at all -- muscle is denser than fat, and people come in a huge variety of shapes, which is why nobody gives a shit what you weigh. Don't talk about height and weight with regards to clothing, they are aggressively irrelevant.  
HEIGHT AND WEIGHT ARE NOT CLOTHING MEASUREMENTS."
"My suit fits very well, but the main button around its waist is off center (almost midway between my midsection and my hip), and it feels weird to expose that one off center button. Maybe that's normal though?"

"Ok you're totally right. And I can't argue with that. And if I was tailoring a suit, I would need to be more specific. However, it's a Carhartt longsleeve.

However, especially if you have a large mall near where you live, you could check department stores or jewelry retailers there, like Neiman Marcus or Macys maybe, idk... "
ha! i had no idea this was a desirable look
"This sub doesn't hate shorts in general, just cargo shorts. And jorts are, uh, controversial I guess. But chino shorts are fine."
"Yeah I disagree with the poster on boat shoes and Vineyard vines. In Florida Sperry's boat shoes and vineyard vines are pretty much staples, especially if your going somewhat upscale. If you want to get a bit more diversity in brands, Sebago makes great boat shoes for a little bit more price. I prefer Minnetonka moccasins but penny loafers also can mix things up a bit and def fit the scene. For sneakers, look into Nike Stefan Janoskis in white.

OP I think everything you described is perfect for whatever college your going to in Florida and wouldnt be out of place. For bottoms, to diversify, get some nice lightweight jeans in a nice light blue color and cuff em to show ankles, easy nuff. Lightweight joggers in khaki scream a bit streetwear but a nice alternative. If your worried about shorts, just get them in different pastel colors like a light blue or salmon. 

I love TOMS, the sub gets controversial for them because of their business models but fuck it I think they look good and also perfect for Florida.

Get some linen shirt button downs if yah feelin dressy, OCBDs of course are also nice. For tees, stick with those prep brands, especially if theyre the kind with the small logo in the front and graphic on the back. 


Although TBH a majority of the time you'll be inside in the AC anyways so you can bit a bit more relaxed in wearing heavier stuff but just dont expect too much layering. Other than that get some university gear like shirts, hoodie, and sweatpants and for those low effort days."
"Hey there, I just graduated from a university in New Orleans. My style isn‚Äôt preppy, but I can make a few opinions/recommendations about how to deal with the heat while at college. You may or may not agree with me on all of this.

Regarding shorts, I believe there is nothing wrong with well fit shorts, especially in college. I think most of MFA would agree. Personally, I avoid chino shorts and look for linen/cotton or twill fabrics. The key to shorts is the length. Above the knee, but not too high above the knee. 

Regarding pants, get linen/cotton blend or lightweight cotton for the summer. Jomers is a good option.

Espadrilles (Toms) would be a good option for new shoes, but just for the spring/summer. I wouldn‚Äôt wear them in the fall/winter. Avoid the Toms brand though. Espadrilles are supposed to be cheap, simple shoes and Toms has wrecked that idea, in my opinion. There was a thread on espadrilles just last month. If you find that thread, you‚Äôll find some alternatives to Toms.

Avoid getting new boat shoes (Sperry‚Äôs) ~~because they look silly if you aren‚Äôt on a boat. I wore them for years, but then one day I realized it‚Äôs just weird to wear them all of the time. There‚Äôs much better and more unique/stylish shoes~~. Just don't get more than one pair.

You might want to get a pair of canvas Vans or leather Nike trainers. You‚Äôll hear a lot about Nike Killshots on MFA. You don‚Äôt need to get Killshots per say, but look for shoes in that style.

Lastly, please avoid Vineyard Vines. I‚Äôve never seen anything special/unique from them. If you like prep, you‚Äôre better off with J.Crew or Bonobos on sale.

I hope that‚Äôs somewhat helpful. If you look through some of the discussions from the last couple of months, you‚Äôll see lots of discussion about summer wear. 

Edit: more on boat shoes. I sailed for my university‚Äôs sailing team. I still don‚Äôt see boat shoes. Most sailors wear sandals or sailing boots, depending on what they are doing and the size of the boat."
"I'm also a soccer player of similar height/weight who lives in the south and just graduated a southern college. If you want to keep going prep, I think shorter inseam shorts look really good (especially if you have those nice soccer legs). Think 5"" inseam. Linen shirts, shorts, and pants are all good ways to add texture but stay cool. Sadly, there's not too much interesting stuff you can do because of heat besides that. "
"I‚Äôve got a few athletic plain shirts from north face and Columbia that really help in the heat for going to class, and they don‚Äôt look like just work out shirts"
"Just so you know, chinos are characterized by having a cotton twill weave, and chino shorts would be the same as ""twill shorts""

I also disagree with your boat shoe point. I find them to be quite comfortable and they work well any time that it's warm out."
"Agreed re: boat shoes, I don't think there's a strong association with boats despite the name. That said, if OP already owns a pair then he might be better off getting a different kind of shoe e.g. a penny loafer."
"Really? I thought twill fabric is more visible diagonal weave and chinos have a tighter, less visible weave."
That's a fair point!
"They do have a twill weave, but it may be finer than on something like a twill suit jacket. The diagonal lines are still visible but you may need to look closely depending on color, lighting, and weave size."
"The burgundy tie, or a dark red, would be a nice choice. A silver/grey tie would work well too. I know you said solid tie, but [this tie](http://www.brooksbrothers.com/Dot-Slim-Tie/A638,default,pd.html) in the black/white would look really good I think. You could also trend from the burgundy to the more purple realm; eggplant color.

As for pocket square, I'd go with white personally. It's classic and you can spritz it up a little, if you want, by the way you fold it. The blue pocket square could work if you go with a grey/silver tie."
"Black silk necktie, white linen pocket square. It's a great look that only really works at night where you aren't wearing a tux."
"Black, burgundy or navy tie would work. I agree paisleys are hard to pull off - imo, you get what you pay for in paisleys and the best ones come from brands likes Drake's. Most cheap paisleys are awful colors and patterns.

For the pocket square, either go white linen or something that **coordinates** or **complements** the tie, but **doesn't match it**. [Here is a guide to pocket squares I put together with examples](https://imgur.com/a/aZbHo). In your case, with burgundy tie, my instinct is a white linen PS with burgundy piping, if you want to avoid a plain white square. I would not do a light blue PS with a burgundy tie and a black suit/white shirt, as that just doesn't really go at all."
I don't think black tie and a blue pocket square would be too much. Just make sure the groomsmen aren't wearing blue too since you mentioned not wanting to look like one. You see plenty of black tie weddings where people will dress it up with colored suspenders or accents so it should be fine
"Get a [wedding tie](https://putthison.com/weddingattireformen/). There's a nice selection at [Kent Wang](http://www.kentwang.com/ties?cat=68), I own the glen plaid one and it's subtle but just enough texture to pair well with a solid-color suit.

For the pocket square, go with solid white."
"White linen, black silk. Blue has zero place in black tie. Burgundy or crimson maybe as a pocket square, but perhaps best only w a cream dinner jacket. "

"Wear whatever, you‚Äôre not James Bond."

That guide you put together is impressive! 
The outfit you are suggesting is just way too low on the formality spectrum.

Nice! Sounds like a winner.
"Thanks, and good luck! When starting out, I'd recommend pocket squares that contain the colors of some of your favorite ties. Have lots of blue ties? Get PSs with blue polka dots or blue patterns. Lots of burgundy work ties? Pick up one with some dark red in it. Etc.

Or buy one with lots of colors going with your favorite ties. For example, most of my ties are navy, burgundy, and forest green (I love forest green) so [this Kent Wang one is probably what I wear most](http://www.kentwang.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/thumbnail/0dc2d03fe217f8c83829496872af24a0/8/5/8575880370_fb7bed0267_b_1_1.jpg).

Lots of summer blazers and ties in bold primary colors? [Try this](http://www.kentwang.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/thumbnail/0dc2d03fe217f8c83829496872af24a0/1/3/13037706104_656bf82a1b_b_2_1.jpg). Lot of deep, dark tones like dark navy and burgundy? [Something like this](http://www.kentwang.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/thumbnail/0dc2d03fe217f8c83829496872af24a0/2/1/21911246058_032aeac8e0_k.jpg) would cover all your navy, burgundy, green and gold ties."

It‚Äôs inspired by my relationship to my longtime collaborator, the artist Aaron Aujla, who is the co-owner of Green River Project.‚Äù (Green River Project, a New York‚Äìbased design studio, collaborated with Bode on the one-off furniture examples presented today alongside the clothing‚Äîthese items included an exceptionally attractive bench, inspired by railcar seating from the filmmaker Satyajit Ray‚Äôs 1966 feature Nayak, for which Bode found the upholstery fabric while sourcing textiles in Wyoming.)

>Bode‚Äôs source-points are often close to the heart: her family, those she admires, all people. Aujla‚Äôs story is that his grandfather traveled to Canada in the 1920s on a forged passport, before India gained independence from British colonized rule in 1947. Part of that freedom came from a cottage industry‚Äîpromoted by Gandhi‚Äîof Indians producing khadi, a handwoven cloth, at home and in their villages. Khadi ‚Äúcreated employment, a stronger economy, and self-reliance,‚Äù said Bode, noting that, beforehand, the British were buying Indian yarns, making clothes in England, then selling them back to India. The end result for this collection, she added, subsequently infuses Anglo-Canadian (Aujla‚Äôs family remained settled in Canada) into majority Indian influences, ranging from, say, lightweight khadi bowling shirts to a suit‚Äînodding to the English‚Äîdone in toweling material and lined in blue-green stripes against textured white. Also in Bode‚Äôs story: rugby shorts and shirts; waffle-knit short-sleeve shirts; Bengalese embroideries; pants that repurpose the cloth and graphics once produced by government-subsidized mills in India; and souvenir T-shirts featuring the Indian flag. Tying it all together: the 24-spoke wheel at the center of that banner symbolizes Gandhi‚Äôs call for Indians to become more self-sufficient by looming and crafting their own clothing. Nothing, then, is askew in Bode‚Äôs architecture.

>She‚Äôs demonstrated her immense skill‚Äîhere as much as ever‚Äîbut there is one ongoing question that fans and followers continue to ask: What is her balance between one-of-a-kind and reproducible goods? As Bode grows, she is figuring it out, and has found a navigable rhythm for the moment. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre still largely focused on vintage textiles,‚Äù she says, ‚Äúand then we work to find something that is reproducible from them. We have mills and producers in India, actually. And, when buyers come, they shop on the rack, and say, ‚ÄòHow close can you get to this piece?‚Äô Some want each piece exactly the same, and others want only one of a kind. We‚Äôre calibrating it, but it‚Äôs working.‚Äù And that, it feels, is starting to be the foundations of her business‚Äôs story‚Äîall of which we will continue to watch with fascination as Bode moves past the two-year mark."
"Never heard of this brand, but it's really a very fun lookbook.  It reminds me of an even more outlandish STORY MFG. style.  The boxy Havana and bowling shirts and the wide-legged, ornately-adorned pants are all things that can be paired with more muted pieces and worn by just about anyone.  "
"I love a lot of the pieces.

I am tired of blue/brown/black, and I especially in summer, I want color!"
Where can I find these type of stuff but affordable?
A lot of interesting pieces in this collection. 
Those pants are incredible. Legit considered picking up a pair until I saw prices
"""pretty much everywhere....it's gonna be loose"""
"She just showed in NYFW and apparently was a big hit. Indie label I think. I liked some of those pants, but sadly not at $700"
"She's been at it for a few collections now. Big hit as you said - picked up by several retailers. Her work, along with brands like By Walid and Loewe, are the harbingers of a more playful, and heritage oriented future in western menswear. I hope it catches on. "
"Reddit mobile wouldn‚Äôt play sound so I just watched lanky guys pace around a parking structure with serious model face in silence.

Thanks for the laugh."
9:25 why didn't he get Elias Riadi for those Astroboy viebs lool
"Loved this show, Jun can do no wrong lol"
Hmm pairing this with thrift stores would work nice. But i still need to find the right fit for my arms
"I do this too and highly recommend it.  It was very easy to learn, and now it takes 15-20 minutes to take in the sides of a button up shirt unless I make a mistake.  I recommend practicing on thrift stuff to learn how to sew exactly where you want and how the machine works.  Button up shirts are easier than t-shirts, because the fabric doesn't stretch or deform nearly as much, so I recommend starting with those while learning how to sew."
"Really nice series of videos.

I have access to a stitching machine, I should try this one day."
"So I hear sentiments like these, and then I hear the opposite end of the spectrum where people say that even after much practice anything more complicated than a hem is still super difficult to get right (with tapering being very difficult), and that it's still worth the cost and time savings to have a tailor do the job unless you intrinsically enjoy doing the tailoring yourself. Not sure what to believe on this topic."
I'd love to be able to tailor stuff. I should really give it a go as I'm picky as hell and feel like the tailors I go to dont have that great attention to detail.
How much was the initial cost of buying all the necessary tools/material?  
I need to pick up a sewing machine.  I wont do my own clothes (at least to start) but my 3 year old is a little monster.  He wears 5-6 clothes and the shorts and pants are always far too long on him and look ridiculous.  I want to pick up a machine and start hemming them so they look normal.  Ill have to taper as well as the leg openings will be large that high up on the leg but this would easily be a worthwhile investment in a year for sure.  
"nice, I just bought a polo shirt today that I like other than the way it fits in the body. I think I might do this with it, thanks for posting"
"Do you have any advice/videos on shortening a t-shirt? I'm short and pretty thick in the gut. It's hard to find a shirt that doesn't hug my waist without being down to the bottom of my zipper. The George brand T shirts from Walmart (https://www.walmart.com/ip/Men-s-and-Big-and-Tall-Men-s-Stripe-Tee-up-to-size-3XLT/288033491 but not big and tall) are really the only ones I've found that fit decent, but they are still a little long and lacking in style options.

I'd love to be able to find a shirt that fits my shoulders and waist that I can shorten."
"Any brand recommendations for a sewing machine?  I just spent a lot of money on new clothes and most of them fit pretty well, but I have just some caveats that I want to fix."
sometimes i get confused about my looks 
"Thank you for this. I've been doing pants for 9 months now, but had not yet ventured to shirts. This is helpful."
I have a question on the zig-zag stitch: in the case of shirts (tee or button-down) do you do the method where one stitch is in the shirt and the other is just off the edge of the shirt or do you do more of the both stitches are right into the fabric with one of those stitches close to the edge?
"You can take in overly wide sleeve arms using a similar, fairly simple technique.  Redoing the sleeve length at either the cuffs or the shoulders is very difficult and time consuming though.  I shortened the sleeves on a dress shirt by taking off the cuffs and then reattaching them, and it basically took an entire day. "
"Aye, that's the problem I've had with a few of my shirts I've had taken in - once the torso is slimmed and appropriate, the sleeves suddenly look weirdly billowy."
What problems do you have with your arms?
"Most of my shirts don't have a zig-zag stitch though.

It looks like they have two straight stitches running in parallel, and they seem to have the edges of the fabric hidden in the middle of both stitches (probably to keep the fabric from peeling.

I've never stitched in my life, but that looks harder to do overall."
"Can't agree with you more! The best thing is to scour the clearance racks at Target and Kohl's and pay next to nothing for your clothes, then tailor them to look awesome. 

Usually all the normal sizes go quick, so you can get a killer deal on the shirt that's too big and won't fit anyone and they won't take the time to tailor it. "
Thanks! And yes you should!
"Really depends on what you're trying to do. Take in the sides of a shirt? Easy as hell. Removing the waistband and slimming the seat in jeans? Doable but a pain in the ass. I posted this here because at the end of the day most people just want their shirts to fit better and not be so boxy, which is incredibly easy to fix."
Well the tailors you go to probably do have a lot of attention to detail but the problem is their expensive...
"Damn near nothing. I use my mom's sewing machine, and you can walk into a thrift store and get a decent machine for like $20. "
"Yeah man, keep us updated if you give it a shot. And if you need a machine seriously start by checking a thrift store or on Ebay first. Target and Amazon have them but make sure you wanna commit before you spend $80 on one. "
"Yeah man, let me put something together for ya. Can you do me a favor and PM me tomorrow and remind me incase I forget? "
"Anything made by Singer in the last...80 years should be fine lol. Otherwise just get whatever one is most cost effective. Check the best selling one on Amazon (I'd link to it but I'm on mobile and...well to be honest too lazy right now) but that one is solid. I was just about to get that one but I use my mom's and she passed away so I'm pretty attached to it now.

Definitely don't start on your new clothes!! Get some cheap undershirts to practice on or even like a few dish towels for a few bucks. I would HATE for you to ruin your new clothes. I'm pretty proficient with sewing now but I still make mistakes damn near all the time. The only thing is I spend maybe $10 bucks on a t shirt so if I mess up its not the end of the world. "
"I struggle with pants, any advice?"
"Good question! I do it so that one stitch is on the fabric and the other is just off of it. As you go along a few of the stitches won't be perfect in that some will both be on the fabric or neither will be but it doesn't matter, as long as it's not for more than a few stitches. "
"I do the torso and arms in one go, if the arms are too baggy. Just keep the stitch going past the armpit, and blend it into the original seam somewhere around the forearm."
He waves them in the air like he just doesn‚Äôt care?
"I don't use a zig-zag stitch.  You turn the shirt inside out, and then sew a straight stitch the appropriate distance inside the existing stitch tapered to the shape you want. After sewing and checking to make sure it fits properly, I cut out the extra fabric.  When you turn the shirt back right-side in, it looks like you described.  [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcDRcgDYVlQ) is a decent video that helped me get started, but it's the same basic technique as the one in the op.   I take a little more care than he (the video I linked) does in the measuring and shaping now, but still use this basic technique to take in the sides of a shirt."
"They're called ""flat fell seams"" and while they take a little practice they're not that hard to do if you've got okay fine motor control. Easier than most video games imo. And they don't require a specialised or heavy duty machine."
Absolutely.  Great videos by the way!
"Yeah man that's what I'm saying, I've heard that even tapering the sides is pretty damn tough to do properly. Still at some point I might give this a shot, if for no other reason than I'd enjoy learning a new skill."
Do you know what to look for in one? I imagine theres a lot of broken ones too. I'd be interested in tailoring my pants. 
"Question for you: I don't have any place to put a sewing machine sadly, how well does those [portable machines work](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07C3LW5R1/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_rnUrBb7JH17H8)?

Or is there a tabletop portable one you or anyone would recommend? "
you realize your time is worth something right?
"I'm probably going to just return it actually(it doesn't fit as well as I thought when I tried it in-store), but I'll try this on another cheap t-shirt first. I also have a sweatshirt that fits me really well in the arms+chest but is way too baggy in the stomach, I want to fix  that eventually. same with a few button down shirts

I'll check a thrift store first for sure, thanks for the advice"
Definitely! Thank you so much!!
"Which part phases you? I start by flipping the pants inside out, removing the hem, and then pinning about where I want the pants to taper. Make sure you're taking equal amounts from each side, not all from one. I do one leg, use white chalk to mark all the pins, then move the pins in a little to hold the front and back leg panels together slightly inside of where I'll be sewing. Then, using a straight edge I draw lines connecting all the marks where the pins were. I sew the pants with a straight stitch and then lay the finished leg over the other, and mark the appropriate spots to transfer the lines over and do it again.

The hem is where it can be tricky, but it depends on the type of pants and whether you're just doing a straight stitch or a half blind stitch. This video covers most of what I described:

https://youtu.be/9OSTz4EsBzY"
"Awesome! And as a follow up to that have you noticed any issues with threads coming loose or anything of the sort to note? I'm planning on starting off by tailoring my shitty fitting scrubs first and want to make sure if I need to bring backups in the event of a ""wardrobe malfunction"""
"Yes, yes he does."
"I remember watching that video when I got started as well haha. He actually does use a zigzag stitch, he just calls it an overcast stitch. It's the exact same thing however. 
"
Thank you I appreciate that! I'll be adding more to that playlist soon like changing the ugly white shirt buttons on a dress shirt. 
"Remember when you were a kid and you had to cut out the outline of the gingerbread man? It's exactly like that, it's honestly that easy lol."
"Tailoring pants is generally more difficult.  You usually have to pick apart the waistband seams and the taper needs to be very even.  Often the belt loops will be in the way and need to be picked and reattached.  Jeans can be a huge pain in the ass because the stitching is often visible and everything needs to be perfectly matched and lined up.   
 The only thing that is fairly easy on pants is hemming dress pants.  If that is what you want to do (hemming), make sure the sewing machine you get has a blind stitch setting and blind stitch presser foot.  "
"You're right you do run the chance of coming across a broken one but what happens more often than not is grandma passes away and no one knows how to use it so they donate it. You can check on Amazon too, they're like $90 on there. 

The fundamentals of a sewing machine haven't changed much in 100 years so a machine from the great depression will work just as well as one from the 70s and one from 2018. 

Pants can be a bit tough but I've done them multiple times successfully. What is it that you would wanna do to them maybe I could help you out?"
"I don't have a place to put it either lol, I use mine on my kitchen table. You definitely don't need a special table or location in your house to use it. "
"If you want to be pedantic and take that route, not everyone has the option to work as much as they'd please, so only certain amounts of my time per week directly corresponds to money. You also could multitask and spend time you'd otherwise spend watching TV to sew and watch TV. You'd come out saving in that scenario too. Either way it's a good skill to learn and can save many people some money."
"Hah, true!"
"Solid idea, definitely practice on some cheap shirts first."
"For what you wanna do with your shirt it would be pretty easy actually, roll your shirt to the level you want it to be at, and then roll it down by about a half inch or so, and sew a straight stitch across the new level you want it to be at. Does that make sense? "
Thanks for sharing! I can taper pants fine but the waist is what trips me up...
"Haven't noticed a single issue with ripped seams or loose threads or anything like that. You should definitely tailor your scrubs, I was considering getting a job as a pharmacy tech and was going to do the same actually. As you know scrubs fit like garbage bags so nothing would make you stand out more than a tailored pair would."
What about tailoring the shoulder seams to fit just right instead of looser and shortening the sleeves so they end mid-bicep.Are those possible and easy?
"Thanks I'm going to save your thread, because I have a lot of shirts that have muffintops when I wear them. Thanks for the response!"
i wasnt necessarily talking about money. im not wasting my free time sewing shirts to save a couple bucks
"I read this to my mother, who has been tailoring my pants for me, and she knew exactly what you meant... Lol... So she's going to help me do it."
"Ohhhh... I dare not go there... I just find pants that fit in the waist and either fit in length or are slightly long, and I can hem them where I need. Sorry, I thought you meant just plain ol' tapering. 
I would imagine there would be plenty of tutorials on YouTube covering it, though."
Tailoring shoulder seams is difficult and time consuming.  Shortening sleeves on a short-sleeve shirt (either from a long sleeve to a short sleeve or making an already-short-sleeve shorter) is easy once you learn to sew straight.
"You're welcome. I was in the same boat as you, billowy dress shirts were the Bane of my existence. Learned how to tailor and never looked back."
Then this post isn't for you :)
"Some people think it's actually fun, and is more than just a chore for saving money. "
"Haha not everyone's time is worth anything. Like those posts where dudes be like ""i go to 3 thrift stores every week look at this shirt i found wowowoweeee"". Yeah man i got kids, a full time job, i cant be thrifting 3x a week on the off chance there's a used brooks brothers shirt in my size that isnt jacked up for 10 bucks."
"Awesome! Good luck, and let us all know the result!"
"True, tapering pants is tough but it's doable. Just need some patience and Coors light lol. I'll put something together for pants too ü§î"
Will a tailor do the shoulder seams or tailors don't bother with that?Also is shortening short sleeves shorter possible if it has a ribbed armband at the end like a Polo shirt?Thank you for your help.
"A tailor can do shoulders, but they generally charge a lot for it relative to other alterations.  And you can't take things down more than a size (maybe two) or everything gets out of whack.

I've never tried shortening a sleeve with a ribbed/elastic armband.  You could just cut it off and hem the sleeve fairly easily.  If you wanted to take off the armband and reattach it, it is probably possible, but I've never looked closely at the construction, so I don't know how easy it would be to pick the seam and then re-attach the armband.  I've done it with dress sleeve cuffs, and it was a huge pain in the ass."
I'm fragrance addicted and I love it 
"Here's my face (I shot a quick video). Do I look better clean shaven or with a beard? How should I style my hair/beard to not look trash? I'm 28, and people in the office thought I was the new intern or right out of college. They legitimately thought I was 20.
"
style and fragrance works best 
How do you guys trim your eyebrows? I don't want to reshape them but they look very bushy atm. Any advice for doing this the first time? 
Has anyone had experience with Black Label grooming? I saw their hair products on a Facebook ad and brought the craft clay and black mist. I find they work quite well but I'm still a little worried it's a scam and I'm paying way too much for it. 
"Skipped the gym for about a month due to scheduling issues, illness, and my back being a bastard. Plan for next week is to go 3x a week every week unless I have an injury or illness.

I want to pick up a sport or some sort of competition to get me interested but nothing is around that's affordable. 

Weight has been okay. I had a quick loss due to moderate dehydration (food poisoning probably) but gained back to around where I was pre-illness. I'm currently on track to meet my goal weight in November. I'm down 10 lbs from January, but been losing faster overall recently. 15 lbs left.

Aaaand my partner commented on my body, said that I'm definitely more muscular than when I started seeing him...so that's nice.
"
"What are you into?

Inb4 CdG.  Gotta get that 1.7k Rick cologne "
Oh fuck I relate too much
Try growing out the beard and see what it looks like. Nothing wrong with your hair 
"Beard. That said, I also have a beard."
"To be honest you don't look 28 in either case... I guess enjoy it whilst it lasts?

But I think the beard looks better. Might look very nice if you grow it out a bit more and make sure it is conditioned and 'styled' down and tidy, not scraggly."
"I'm personally a fan of clean shaven on you, but overall I'd have to say my favorite is short stubble (although I don't know how that looks on you).

r/malehairadvice could probably help you with styling. "
"I ask my barber to do it. I can‚Äôt trust myself, one slip and you could do permanent damage. "
"I did it for the first time the other day. I bought an eyebrow grooming kit, it comes with scissors, a comb, a brush and tweezers. I basically did some trimming using the scissors and the comb, and then used the tweezers to pluck some hair that was ""out of the line"". 

That said, the next time I'll have them done at the hair salon and watch it very carefully how it's done right."
"Look around the area, especially local facebook pages. I thought the only events in my area where big state level or regionals but turns out there's several much smaller ones throughout the year. (For powerlifting anyways)"
"I'm still a beginner but this is my rotation and what I would like to add

Summer - Got Dylan Blue 

Everday - Got YSL L'homme

Winter - By The Fireplace and Jazz Club

Going out - JPG Ultra Male

Want to add Prada L'homme, CdG Blackpepper, Creed Virgin Island Water and Rasasi Hawas. I also need to try out some of the Zoologist stuff, CdG Man 2, Amouage Sunshine (the woman edition) and a Bleu de Chanel "
[deleted]
The second picture is me with short stubble. 
"Yeah, I'm not interested in power lifting. "
"Where is the A V E N T U S?

I like most of the CdGs, though some weren't my style. Wonderwood and Man are pretty neat.  You might want to try TdH and AdG as well if you haven't yet.  

Your tastes are completely different than mine, so I can't really give you any tips other than that. "
"I think you look fine with one, you just need to maintain it better. Trim it and use some beard oil and it‚Äôll look good. I do think the stubble look suits you though."
"I guess I picture short stubble a little shorter haha

Either way i think it looks good, can't go wrong imo"
"I‚Äôll look out for those Cdg‚Äôs. Aventus was nice but not my favorite, especially the price point I can‚Äôt help but feel like there are much better stuff.

The fragrance world is still completely new to me so can‚Äôt say I really have a taste yet. Please do share what your favorites are"
That beard picture was with me using beard oil. I'll make sure to get it professionally shaped. 
"How much growth was there and did you trim it? My beard (when I had it at least) required a trim like every 2 weeks, so I just did it myself because that was too often/costly to see a pro (unless you‚Äôre friends with one that‚Äôll hook you up). But yours looks a little unkempt in that picture and it goes a long way toward the appearance of your beard."
I never trimmed it. All I did was shave the neckline as I wanted to grow it out as much as possible before giving it shape. 
"> I never trimmed it.

That's probably the reason you were told you didn't look good with a beard.

Those are fucking gorgeous. Damn.
These are neat dude
this thread is really dead now days huh?  Expected to be -50 at least by now. 
Thanks!
"yeah dude, its pretty much just yelling into the void "
"1. Suit Supply. They have a ton of options and style he can look through, although if he prefers American manufacturing, he'll likely have those styles crafted locally or through a US plant like Southwick.

2. Grey is fine, but I'd also include deep navy. Both are versatile. A Super 120's wool in a standard twill/weave should be fine for most of the year. He may need to layer in Winter. 

3. Made in the USA? Southwick ($$) and Hardwick ($) make decent OTR suits. Either way you'll need tailoring. Full made to measure should start around $1000...

"
"1) Do not go the website route with many choices. It is easy to get overwhelmed by hundreds of options when you don‚Äôt have direction especially with men‚Äôs suit where the variation in the options isn‚Äôt that great.
2) as far as what to get. Go with grey (medium or charcoal) and blue (lighter or navy) with that most shirts match interchangeably and there is no guess work. Their also appropriate for most situations which do call for a suit. 
3) as far as brands suit supply makes nice stuff off the rack but their sourcing and where they‚Äôre made probably wouldn‚Äôt work for you. Jack victor makes nice good quality suits in Canada, you could look into that and they do made to measure as well. 
4) for local custom suits and some articles that may help check out articlesofstyle.com great content and they are ny based and have an American factory that makes their suits "
"When it comes to tailored clothing, the most important thing is fit. If he‚Äôs going to be wearing this constantly, then he should seek out a tailor who can fit him the best. Frankly, unless you fit perfectly off the rack (and it sounds like neither of you are an expert in judging this) then I‚Äôd skip that and go find a tailor in NYC that can do bespoke. 

The tailor will be able to not only fit him properly, but also advise him on cloth, construction, drape, silhouette and much more. You‚Äôre not paying for a suit: you‚Äôre paying for expertise. I would look at Martin Greenfield or Leonard Logsdail for real bespoke and CEGO for shirts. 

You should research the difference between bespoke and made to measure. Many places that claim to be bespoke are actually doing made to measure. 

Also, it‚Äôs important to note that many places on the cheaper end of the scale do half-canvas construction in the jacket rather than full canvas. Southwick does only half canvas I believe. 

Many of the made to measure places you‚Äôll come across will probably be manufacturing in China. Frankly, they‚Äôre going to be a better value. Reason being that labor is cheaper, but so are import taxes ‚Äî for the moment. Provided the fitter is experienced and skilled, your money can go further and better quality fabrics can be obtained for significantly less than if it was made elsewhere. ‚ÄúMade in China‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean poorly made like it might‚Äôve used to be. You can get any level of quality from China that‚Äôs on par with the best from Italy, England or America ‚Äî it‚Äôs just not romanticized. 

If you‚Äôve got the time and money, visit a lot of places. Get personal recommendations from friends who wear suits and have good taste. Just keep in mind the more personal the relationship you have with the tailor/fitter you‚Äôll probably have a better experience. YMMV if you‚Äôre dealing with a random salesman at a shop. "
"[Epaulet](https://epauletnewyork.com) is a great option, US made."
"Honestly in 2018, are suits a requirement. 

Last suit I wore was in 2018. Zegna. It was a cringe worthy mistake...wore it to a job interview with an Hermes tie. 

Now I just wear an untucked dress shirt and chinos with boots. 

Only people that wear suits are the cringe college kid interns"
"Thank you, this is great information. I'll suggest deep navy. I'm glad to learn that there are some wools that would work. He's definitely happy to layer in winter so that should be fine.  


Southwick and Hardwick with tailoring, check! I'll see what he thinks about full made to measure vs. OTR with tailoring. It seems like the price difference will only be a couple hundred dollars if we're looking at a made-in-the-USA OTR suit, yeah? Hmmm."
"Ooh, that's a good point. That is exactly my problem with men's suits - I see the small differences but don't understand what they mean / have no emotional reaction to them lol.

Thanks for the [articlesofstyle.com](https://articlesofstyle.com) link! This looks like it's the kind of thing he would be interested in, I can tell already. "
"Thank you, this is extremely helpful - and matches with some of my experiences with getting bespoke women's clothing. I think I'll try and push him that direction. The research I've been doing so far seems like it's ultimately probably not worth it to go MTM - if he's going to be buying multiple suits at once and investing that much $$$ into the purchase, then wearing them every day, why cut that final corner?

Regarding made in China, I think my husband's concern is mostly with labor practices and not with the quality - but perhaps it'll bear further investigation given what you say. But I think that he'll really resonate with what you're saying about the relationship with the tailor/fitter. I know that one of the things that he most enjoyed, when I introduced him to buying clothes at the higher end of the scale, was having personalized attention and concern.

If only we had friends who wear suits and have good taste! LOL. Very few folks we know do, and those who do wear suits frequently are more the Men's Wearhouse type. So your comments are incredibly helpful. Thank you very, very much."
Thank you! That's interesting - they source fabrics from Southwick etc. but then do custom suits? Huh!
"Depends on where you work. I used to work in the Canadian Civil service, yes, people still wear pinstripes "
"If you think the only people that wear suits are cringe college kids than you have false view of reality. Even been to any major city? Wearing a suit isn‚Äôt cringe, you probably just can‚Äôt pull it off. I actually like the look of a tailored suit and it definitely isn‚Äôt cringe when you are wealthy. America is becoming extremely casual and that‚Äôs not a bad or good thing, but suits will always have their place. If dressing well is cringe to you, why are you even on this sub?"
There‚Äôs some fantastic brick and mortar suit stores in NYC. Having a tailor there will make things a lot easier. 
"Re: Bespoke v MTM, to be honest I've done both and MTM is just a much better value proposition to me, depending on the quality of the MTM of course. I wear suits every day for work, and often wear cotton suiting for casual occasions. 

It requires finding a MTM operator whose pattern fits your body type the best, but if you can find one that suits, then in my view MTM makes much more sense if you're going to be wearing suits every day and thrashing them a bit. 

The idea of chasing the perfect suit is a trap, in my view. Bespoke will bang on about being perfect for your measurements, but at the end of the day everyone's bodies fluctuate in size and shape, even on a daily basis.

In answer to your queries:

1. I think it might be good for your husband to look into the different styles of suits and what he likes best. I favor Italian neapolitan suiting with softer shoulders and minimal lining. Your husband might prefer a french style, or english style, but he should look into those options. Given he doesn't want to wear a tie and is wearing it 'around' day to day, I think neapolitan might suit due to its more casual styling than other styles. 

2. I don't know what it's like in NYC, but if he is going to be wearing suiting effectively as 'casual' clothing, I would think grey is way too boring and businesslike. I'd personally go with a blue, but if he's going bespoke or MTM they will have many different fabrics. Go see the tailor/fitter and sit down with them, and rather than suggesting 'blue' or 'grey', I am sure he will be drawn to a particular color when he sees it. Fabric wise, I would tend to favor a lighter summer weight, then in winter can layer with an overcoat. 

3. It sounds like your husband is fairly discerning - go MTM or bespoke, he won't like off the rack.

4. I can't really comment, not familiar with NYC"
"Question: how do you find an MTM operator whose patterns fit your body type the best without actually buying and wearing suits from them? Do you suggest buying one suit as a ""pilot"", seeing how it works out, and then buying more from there if that works? That's how I usually buy women's clothes ‚Äî¬†buy one thing, get it tailored if necessary, wear it, then buy more versions of it if it's really that great. I think that part of the appeal with bespoke is being 'certain' that it'll fit.

Italian neapolitan suiting definitely sounds like it's a better fit for him than something fully lined. As I mentioned in the original post, he found this completely unconstructed/deconstructed/whatever sports coat that he loves - it has almost no lining - unfortunately after a couple years Armani isn't making it any more (of course) and even owning multiples it's getting awfully threadbare. So based on that I suspect he'll want to go that direction rather than something more formal.

Good call on the exploring fabrics rather than immediately deciding on a color.

Thank you!!"

"As somebody who hikes casually... Don't get hiking boots because of how they look. Get hiking boots because of how the feel and how much support they offer. A good pair of hiking boots for me may feel slightly off to you, but slightly off after a few hours of hiking translates more to foot discomfort/pain. "
"This is what you‚Äôre looking for: https://www.sorel.com/ankeny-mid-hiker-%7C-010-%7C-10.5-803298697316.html?

You can find them a little cheaper, but they‚Äôre waterproof, stylish, hiking boots that don‚Äôt look like mountaineering stuff.  Imho."
"You might look at something like Danner Vertigo or Jag boots. Or there's a brand called Forsake and another called Ridgemont Outfitters, they both have interesting hiking boots that could be worn casually. "
"I though the general sentiment nowadays was that hiking boots are overly cumbersome and unnecessary, and a rugged high top sneaker would be a superior choice in both weight and all day comfort. See:  
Nike Air Wild Mid  
Nike Terra Sertig  
ACG Lupinek Flyknit SFB
"
"You want cool looking hiking boots and DON'T want mountaineering stuff? 

But Danner mountain light/Viberg hikers and similar looks dooooooope!"
"If you insist on boots, something like the Danner Mountain Light, might be good. It's a nice classic looking boot. 

But I would wear trail runners. More comfortable and a lot less weight on your feet. Also significantly cheaper. "
"They aren't designed specifically for hiking, but I wear my Chippewa Apache boots basically any time I'm outside for a while. Good support, reasonably tough, look better with wear, and the lugged soles are ridiculously grippy."
I've been wanting to pull the trigger on some Danner Mountain Lights for forever. Maybe this year...
Checkout danners explorer 600 or 650. I own the a pair if 600‚Äôs and they have been amazing so far
"Timbs if you need waterproof, insulation, and the fashionable look for something that will work ok for hiking. 

Danner mountain lights/mountain 600 are pretty much the best. They give good support, long term comfort, relatively rigid, and they are long lasting. There are a lot of knock offs of the same  design that are fine for mostly city use. "
You may like the Nike Humara's. Not a legit hiking shoe though but they will probably do the job as well. 
[removed]
"Tbh I prefer trail runners or hiking shoes. Boots are unnecessary in most conditions I've found.

I love the La Sportiva Ultra Raptor but bright yellow and black with huge logo is a look that you gotta want, ha. 

Also look at the Adidas Terrex line for hiking footware that looks pretty good. "
Danner Vertigo 917s are super light and waterproof. I picked some up a few months ago and love them. They are my go to travel boot. 
"Why can't I find a happy medium that is both comfortable and stylish?

That's what OP is asking for. I would think you would understand that as a casual hiker (like yourself), I want boots that are functional for hiking, without being ugly as sin..."
You weren‚Äôt lying. These are dope as hell.
"I second Danner. My Jags are amazing. Lightweight, comfortable and they have taken a hell of a beating."
Danner Vertigo looks pretty neat! thanks!!
"From a functional standpoint, this is dependent on how much weight you're carrying. If it's a light day-pack and you're covering a few miles, then a trail shoe or rugged sneaker can be great since they're usually lighter and more comfortable than a full-on boot.

However, if you're carrying any more than 15-20 pounds on your back, you absolutely need an actual hiking boot. The rigid shank in the sole allows you to put your increased weight on the front of your foot, and the high ankle support is crucial to avoid injury. 

For anything more than a casual trail hike for a few hours, stop worrying about looks and get something functional (I like Asolo's myself). Otherwise you're practically begging for an ankle/hip injury"
i think the Air Wild Mid's the one! thanks so much! :)
Too heavy for walking 
I just pulled the trigger on a lighter pair - hoping they darken up a bit.  Enjoy!!
"I third Danner.  Love my Jags, they wont die."
"Wow what kind of fancy gear do you have?!! My pack at the start of a walk is usually closer to 20kg than 20lb. 

Seconding the ""get something functional"". Breaking your ankles is not worth looking cool."
"Lol, so was mine, but I'm trying to shed as much weight as possible. Strained the shit out of my hip up in Franconia Notch last summer and had to cut a trip short.

"I had a suit MTM, and I'm generally happy with it except for the pants. I asked for no pleat, yet they have a line down the front (and a smaller one down the back). The tailor told me that's normal and not a pleat, just an line from ironing. But I think it's impacting the fit. Around the ankle it's not as tapped as I would like. It seems boxy, almost like it flairs out a bit, which is all that much more noticeable because the rest of the suit is super slim. Does this look right? Would ironing the mock-pleat out fix this, or should I take it back to the MTM place?

Those are pretty loud. Some slim or skinny indigo or black jeans and a plain neutral tee would be fine so you pull the focus to your feet.
I would get some more versatile colors before you branch out to something like red.
"I have a pair of red pants that I wear maybe twice a year to festive events.  Red is a very bold color and pants are a big block of your outfit.  If you are just starting out, your money might be better invested elsewhere.  Frankly I don't think they work with that shirt."
"I think it looks great too! Maybe a little looser fit on the pants, but that's up to you."
Blazer looks great. Tucking in your shirt would make the whole outfit better.
Which fits your style better? 
"38.

You can only alter so much before it throws off the proportions of the rest of the item. It depends what you're comfortable with and what you want.

I like my pants to touch the top of my shoes but not have much of a break, if at all. I've found the leg opening I'm most comfortable with for my body shape is from 7.5"" to 8""."
"I have fairy big thighs compared to my waist. I've found 514s with a 1% strech work for me. I think I had 568s a long time ago, but like a more fitted style now. "
"That's not a pleat. 

But the problem is the leg hole opening is too big. That's what's resulting in it flaring out. The fact that it's pressed down the middle should actually be reducing the amount its flaring out. If you were to smooth it out it, the flare would be even more pronounced. "
The different color blazer is a little odd. Classic brown or black dress shoes go well with navy suits.
"I understand. I just really liked the color and texture of these pants, so I bought them while they were really cheap. I've been following the basic bastard wardrobe pretty closely until now, and it's been pretty great not having to worry about what goes with what. But alas, here we are. Can I ask you for recommendations on how to make these pants work?"
"Thanks for the response. I've already bought these pants for fairly cheap (\~$20), so I think I'll hold onto them for a while then. Do you have any recommendations for colors that work with red?"
"Thanks man - this was a week or so ago and I have actually since bought slightly looser chinos, so should be good :)"
Yeah i was thinking 38 too because my waist is probably around 34-36 and bringing it down from a 40 might be a bit too much.

Thanks! Is this something the tailor can easily fix?

There was a[ backpack thread ](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/8uaj1y/your_favorite_for_backpacks/)a few weeks back. Might be a good starting point.
"Get a Herschel Little America backpack (I have the larger size), they're great for school large main compartment that has a laptop section and two (I use them for sunglasses and portable battery) pockets on the side wall of the main compartment and a front storage compartment. The buckles make it really easy to close the backpack.

They are a little pricey ($99), but I seriously think they're worth it.  I bought mine at the beginning of highschool and it lasted 4 years but then one of the buckles fell off. But they have a lifetime warranty so I just called customer support and within a week, the replacement came in completely free (didn't have to pay shipping and I even got to pick a new color because they send you a coupon for the price). 

Overall, I think the quality is great and there is a ton of space to store everything you're going to be carrying around with you. Worth spending the money on, especially knowing that you have the lifetime warranty.

The color I have I guess isn't running anymore but they have a ton of different options:

Their jeans have A LOT of stretch and are super comfy. Get the ones that say ""Transcend"" and they will keep their shape. Nordstrom carries them (I believe they are going on sale soon for their Anniversary sale). Also, try Nordstrom Rack, you can get them for like half the price there. Pro tip: Nordstrom does free hemming for full-priced items, make sure to get them hemmed to your correct length. If it's on sale, I believe it's $10."
"You can get good looking clothes that aren't so tight they restrict your motion. Plenty of people wear some type of sweatpants or joggers in a fashionable way. Regular, not skin tight, straight cut jeans can be good looking too. You can go with a stretch blend, or with a different cut with gussets to help with that if you want to stay with jeans. Even in loose fitting jeans I'm not sure you will be unrestricted for a headkick. Jeans are probably the most restrictive type of pants. 

Regular cotton chinos, or wool slacks are free of restriction in comparison to jeans. Or go with another kind of pants like outlier, lululemon ABC, uniqlo golf pants, or old navy go dry performance that are more flexible but still appropriate for most situations. "

Btw: cowboy boots hurt like hell to be kicked with. I know from experience."
"I can tell you that I‚Äôve never been in a scenario where I thought ‚Äúhmm a swift headkick could really solve things‚Äù. Force yourself out of your comfort zone so you can move past it.

"Yes! Those are all great, especially AGs! "
"I've been in quite a few actually. Usually involving drunk assholes. I've always been able to do-escalate it, but it happens"
"Quite a few? Are you sure you are not a part of the escalation process rather than the de-escalation? 

I get that you are here solely looking for advice for clothes and this comment is unwelcome to you but 99.9% of us manage to go out, get stupidly drunk and do stupid stuff and still never get into a fight. Basically, unless you are looking for it - no, it doesn't happen."
"Look, I've got a mouthful of chipped teeth from catching one sucker punch. I'm a very polite, mild mannered guy. I do genuinely de-escalate, but there are irrational people out there, I've had knives pulled on me and I do the smart thing and run. 

Stuff like that makes you paranoid. I just want to feel comfortable and confident in my clothes, for me, being able to move is part of that."
That's awful. Hopefully you got some good suggestions in this thread to help you out. Myself I'd probably  go for denim joggers or twill sweatpants. Hope you have better luck in the future.

Where do you purchase pieces from the Y's line? I haven't found any on line or in brick and mortar stores."
"ed: all good now on the links

Solid post."
"Thank you for writing this. It's crazy to think that the cardinal loose and flowy look that pervades all across Japan can be traced to what Yohji has done. Though I'm generally not a fan of all-black looks, I've come to appreciate the beauty of an all-black Yohji look. I personally find the color black boring but his pieces allow for so much creativity within a limited palette. 

I always considered his prices to be unattainable in the west but I recently purchased [balloon trousers](https://i.imgur.com/Df8WL2p.jpg) which are the funnest things I own. One day I'd love to own one of his painted leather jackets. This is a wonderful post!"
"Great overview of the designer and one that I learned a lot from myself. Thank you for writing it.

> He had such a profound impact on Japanese fashion that most if not all current brands from all different lifestyles use his style of drape and flowing silhouette.

This makes so much sense! I've been fascinated with Japanese fashion for a while now and I could tell there was some kind of common thread going through the outfits I saw on Instagram, but I couldn't tell what it was. I've been trying to emulate it with my Western brand clothing but now that I know where it comes from my goal will be much easier to accomplish. I'm a woman and mostly wear brands like Elizabeth Suzann, Margaret Howell, TOAST, Arket and Uniqlo... I'd love to add some Y's to my wardrobe though.

Do you know if there are any websites that sell Y's men and/or women's in Europe (would like to avoid US import fees if at all possible)? I buy pretty much all of my MHL/Margaret Howell second hand from eBay but I haven't seen much of Y's there."
Great content! 
"The drape and silhouette in this album is really cool. Even as someone who dresses preppy and could never dream of pulling this off.

For some reason I think the women's wear is even more striking than the men's.  Especially on the Asian models, maybe because all of the black doesn't contrast as much."
Glad you included that photo from Dolls. It's my personal favorite Kitano. I really want to try out some Yohji but I don't like the color black :[
"I found a pair of Yohji trousers on Oxfam UK's webshop, believe it or not. I ordered them and tried them on. Unfortunately the sizing just didn't match up with what I expected. The fabric was absolutely gorgeous though, was gutted they didn't work as they would have been the perfect insanely-wide-leg-trouser."
"I like the style and his philosophy behind it. I‚Äôve always thought some of the pieces were really cool and like the aesthetic. Definitely like the comments about androgyny because I think our classifications of clothing are too rigid

There are a few things I‚Äôve noticed though. I don‚Äôt think I could ever see myself in this style, maybe a bit in between. Second, kind of like SLP, I find that this can be a style that you have to be careful with. It can easily fall into the territory of ‚Äúthe outfit wearing the person‚Äù instead of the other way around. I find you have to go full Yohji or have just some sort of look about you to pull it off completely."
"[As a Frenchman, my first thought when I hear about Yohji Yamamoto.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJdW0oqGX1c&feature=youtu.be&t=65)

Edit : sorry for shitposting

"
"May i ask an honest question?  What is the difference between these outfits and a poorly dressed man?  Im being serious.  The bagginess and fact that none of these clothes fit just remind me of that typical IT guy ( i am an IT guy lol) that wears things that dont fit well at ALL.  I realize that my style is my style and i dont have to like all styles, but i really dont understand this baggy look at all.  It is incredibly sloppy looking to me.    


With that said, how do you distinguish fashionable vs sloppy loose clothing other than a price tag?  What other characteristics do you use to determine that?  "
"First off, very well written. Second, I personally don't look the Yohji look, but it's deliberate and unified... It has a PLAN and I admire that. Third, your interpretation of the designer is much more palatable than the designer inspiration album. Some of the shots in your Instagram are perfectly relatable while still making an avante garde-ish statement. Well done. (Which designer (s) made shirts with man walking a tiger and what looks like a repeating eyeball design,?)"
"Yohji was one of the first unorthodox designers i heard pg when i started looking into higher end. Would love to rock his looser, longer silhouette but Florida is frustratingly restrictive for fashion. Yohji excels in layering, I hated myself just wearing jeans earlier."
"cool post / nice write up!

drape is such a hard thing to convey online. it's hard to translate the delicacy / fluidity of fabric via photography

I recently received 18ss yyph rayon pants, they're gorgeous!"
It's a little out of date but maybe [this (now-semi-outdated) guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashion/comments/3n12h4/wide_pants_and_looser_silhouette_inspiration/) to loose clothing i wrote a few years back would interest you.
"Everytime u see a yohji mentioned on Reddit picture a dumbass in baggy pants and Ramones writing a 2000 word essay that somehow doesn't show any understanding beyond ""dude... black and loose stuff lmao... drapes""

Just go to the sf thread or something these threads literally never have information that isn't lazily gleaned from more knowledgeable people"
I‚Äôve bought a few off Yahoo!JP through proxying services. The JP prices are far below the US prices in most cases.
YJP is usually the cheapest I can find it. 
"I would buy from YJP. It's the cheapest from what I've seen. If you want new, I would try to get them from Japan if you ever go since they have lots of Y's stores.  "
Things that aren't black or white usually go for the cheapest
"It's hard to say. When done right, it just looks ""right."" I'll try to explain why they look right.  

The inspiration albums have some advantages: the people wearing the clothes are on the attractive side. Also, some of them are models on either runways or photoshoots. So they had the luxury of casting the right model that can flatter the clothes, professionally styled clothing (make sure the clothes fall in the right place), a professional photographer, and a team who are focused on making those clothes look good.

But there are other factors. The cuts are bit different from your standard, sloppy, oversized, baggy clothing. For instance, some of the pants are cropped or tapered. 

The outfits are color coordinated. The silhouette is also dead-on for most of the outfits. Every item of clothing they chose were chosen deliberately to show a specific, flowy, silhouette. 

If you compare with to some random dude with baggy clothing. He might wear some beat-up sneakers with a chino where his inseam and waist size is 1 size too large-- so he has to cinch his belt in an unflattering way. He might couple that with a random, baggy t-shirt with clashing colors. His silhouette might look like a giant blob. Where in the inspiration albums, they would have a more interesting shape to them. "
"I mean did you even look at the inspo album? the cut, the drape, the way people wear it, hell even the confidence n the faces of the people wearing it. I mean you dont see that shit in an IT office, I work across the street from google, and I see more slim fit chinos and oxford button up then anything else.

I mean there is legit an actress, a couple models, and a member of Exile, a famed boyband in there. These people are definitely not poorly dressed. Its a narrow view of whats supposed to be good if that is poorly dressed."
sorry i couldnt write it to your liking. tell me what i can improve on
"Yeah, after looking it all seems a lot more affordable from there. Thanks!"

"I went to Marshalls and picked up 6 pairs of sperry no-shows, for only   6$. Will see how they hold up over time, but would recommend checking stores like that for pricier items on the cheap"
"I have size 13 feet, so a lot of no-show socks don't quite work for me. So far the best I've found are:
[Smartwool Men's No-Show XL](https://www.amazon.com/Smartwool-Mens-No-Show-3-Pack/dp/B00HDDYC6A?th=1&psc=1)

[Gold Toe Men's Micro Flat Oxford No Show](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01B5B7SVQ/)

I also have one pair of shoes that are super super low slip-ons where even those socks will show, and the only pair of no-shows I've found that are low cut enough not to peak up the edges are the [Sperry Invisible Liners](https://www.zappos.com/p/sperry-signature-invisible-liner-3-pair-pack-navy-white/product/8376900/color/513)"
Idk Uniqlo seemed very good for me.
Pair of Thieves socks from target are pretty cheap and SUPER low cut. They also stay on great and have neat designs which I like but doesnt matter at all because theyre no show.
"Darn Tough has recently added actual no-show socks (the ones they had before were still visible, just short): https://darntough.com/collections/mens-lifestyle/height-no-show  All the usual things to say about Darn Tough:  utterly amazing warranty, great materials, wool is the best thing ever, etc.  $14 MSRP, and you'll only ever have to buy like 2 pairs your entire life."
"Just bought some M&Z socks. 6 pack for $17 on Amazon, that's like $3 a pair and they fit very well, better than any U N I Q L O pair I've had.

suffice to say I won't be buying any more from U."
"Uniqlo does not work for large feet.  I have a size 12 and tried a couple different uniqlo ones and while they fit great at first wear, after a couple hours, I felt the tightening.  They ALMOST had it right - they just need to make them a smidge bigger."
"I've had good luck with Invisasox, very thin but they last pretty well. When one pair of mine finally got a hole they sent me a new pack. "
"These aren't even close to best value based on other posts in this thread, but I really love the Tommy John no-shows. 2-pack for $15, but they're good quality and I have no heel slipping when I wear them. 

https://www.tommyjohn.com/products/ultimate-liner-sock-solid-color-2-pack#?color=6&size=8"
"I've been a fan of Finish Line for no shows and casual socks alike. Really comfortable, they have the rubber grip on the back heel, and they don't peek out with any choice of footwear."
"The best in class no-show socks on the market are [the women's no show invisible socks](https://darntough.com/products/womens-solid-top-down-no-show-invisible-light?variant=854115909651).

They last okay, and are super comfy‚Äîand are great for experimenting with a pop of color without going full Dapper Sock Guy"
Muji. More comfortable than Uniqlo and seem to hold up better.
"Walk into a TJ Maxx. I've seen smartwool, darn tough, woolrich and other favorites at my local TJ Maxx, and my local TJ Maxx is usually awful."
"I am not as sure about the patterns right now, but [Jack & Jones](https://www.jackjones.com/gb/en/jj/clothing/underwear/socks/) in general has some really nice socks, whether it's colourful or plain ones, even the no-show socks are decent in their price category, I've bought quite a lot.

Probably more interesting for the EU crowd here, but they're cheap and damn solid. Can't really go wrong with 4 pairs for 10‚Ç¨."
"Muji at \~4USD, not even a contest for me. I typically wear no-shows and Uniqlos are unfortunaely too tight. I wish they made it in two sizes like Muji does (25-27, 28-30)."
Bombas ankle socks can usually be bought with a 20% discount putting them under $10. Super comfortable and durable. The blister tab on the back has been a revelation for me.
Stomper Joe no-show socks.
Honestly... myself and a lot of the people I see at the gym just wear Fila or Puma athletic socks from Costco. Which comes out to be like 5-6 pairs for 10-15 bucks. 
I often get Simply Unstitched from Nordstrom Rack for about $3 a pair.
Darn Tough.
"Walk into a [J. Crew](https://www.jcrew.com/r/search/?N=16+13697&Npge=1&Nrpp=60&Nloc=en). If they have Chup or Anonymousism on sale, go for that. If not, J. Crew's own socks on sale are pretty decent.

Their current website sale has some super cheap options, but their house brand socks are pretty easy to find on the low end of this range.

Also, note that, while it's hard to try socks on, it's good to go in store and feel the differences. Not all of their socks are the same."
"[Outlier Megafine Merino](https://shop.outlier.nyc/shop/retail/megafinesock.html)

Normally $25 each, but the 7 for $98 ($14 ea.) still works even though the site says until June 30."

"I really like the [Vela low-cut socks from OsomBrand](http://www.osombrand.com/shop/vela)

Kickstarted them when initially launching because they are made from 95% upcycled materials, made with a water-less process and they have a high focus on sustainability and responsible sourcing.

They've held up pretty well over about a year and are quite comfortable. Maybe a smidge on the warm side during summer months but definitely great imo."
[Stance](https://www.stance.com/men/). Best designs in the sock business.

Nordstrom Brand IIRC comes in at this level.
"I get all my socks and underwear from aliexpress or similar these days. Bamboo fiber makes excellent material. I've been wearing [these](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/autumn-winter-thicken-bamboo-fiber-brand-business-men-socks-male-high-quality-supermarket-socks-5pairs-lot/32806458280.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.3da24c4d1BiChx) and find them extremely comfortable and reasonably durable, and at under $3 per pair you really can't go wrong. These are as good as socks selling for more than 5 times the price."
"Some of [Darn Tough's ""Lifestyle"" socks](https://darntough.com/collections/mens-lifestyle) can qualify as dress socks."
"Although typically more expensive, [Falke](https://www.falke.com/uk_en/men/sale) has an always-standing sale page with louder socks in this range."
"Per pair, Kirkland Signature."
"Happy Socks.  Comfortable and have great, bold colors to contrast with boring suits."

They're super comfortable, come in multiple sizes, are odor-resistant, and, as far as I can tell, indestructible (coming from someone who regularly destroys socks). I kind of wish they didn't have the logo or the tech-y touches, but you can't see those during normal wear so they can function as both casual and semi-dress."

"As a fellow size-13-er, I second the Smartwool recommendation for loafer socks."
The ‚Äúno-shows‚Äù I got from Uniqlo just ended up being ankle socks. I‚Äôm a US size 12-13 if that means anything.
I have issues keeping them on at the heel and they're a bit too thick for me.
Are these really no-show? 
size?  I'm a size 12 and tried different uniqlo ones and none of them fit well for longer than a couple hours.
"I second [M&Z](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B01ET9F80Y/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1). I like them more than Ninja, Journeys, Uniqlo, etc., basically the best no show i've found."
"I had this very same issue. To add insult to injury, they didn‚Äôt even function as no-shows. They basically are ankle socks on me."
"I got a pair of loafers that shows even ""no-show"" socks, so I'm thinking of getting women's socks like those. But in Japan we remove our shoes before entering homes and sometimes restaurants/izakayas, so I'd be a bit self-conscious..."
What shoe size are you/ which women's size do you wear? I have an issue with no show socks just being a tad bit loose so women's sizing might work better.
"I'll share my Sock Strategy here. Aside from some no-shows, athletic socks, dress socks, or other specialized stuff, all my socks for casual-to-business casual wear are [these Uniqlo ones in the dark gray melange color.](https://www.uniqlo.com/us/en/men-color--socks-404045.html?dwvar_404045_color=COL13&cgid=men-socks#start=13&cgid=men-socks)

I buy a bunch at a time. I never have to spend time matching them- a great little time-saver. They go well with pretty much any dark jean or chino. They're not super-thick like an athletic sock but definitely not thin like a dress sock, and the melange texture makes them look a touch more elevated than just a flat gray sock. I just toss them as they develop holes.

As for the quality, they're fine. Comfortable, stay up reasonably well. If you walk a lot like me you'll wear through 'em, but for the price, they're durable."
"Yeah, I got 3 pairs, hands down the best socks I've owned for the price "
"Never will I buy any other socks again.  Never will I even wear other socks again, unless I'm in a desperate situation.  I'm a fanatic for this brand."
"I'm not a fanatic but they are very comfortable both in the heat and cold (this was a real surprise to me as I had never worn good wool socks before), they seem pretty durable and of course that unparalleled warranty. I won't buy any other casual socks."

"Sadly doesn't seem like the 7 for 98 deal, but still 3 for 59!"
"I have an insane sock collection. I started with a ton of Happy Socks, which though good, are nowhere near as comfortable or long lasting as Stance."
"Plain black socks, though. This is one of the few areas where you get some room for creativity in a semi-formal/business casual setting. Why go with all black?"

"Fun story about my ridiculous luck with socks -- I once wandered into a J. Crew with a friend and found a $1 sock bin. There were some nice J. Crew socks in there... and some Chup masterpieces, which the cashier suspected were placed there by accident. We took all we could carry. That was a good day."

Agree on the dark gray melange! They really do seem to go with almost anything.
Which color is that? 06 Gray or 08 Dark Gray?
"I have 6 pairs of their megafine lows- I  can attest that the material for the  megafine lows are super comfortable but I get the sense they‚Äôll get worn through quickly. I‚Äôm not sure how similar these are to the mega fine merinos but I thought it might be worth throwing in my experience. 

My only complain about he lows is that  they slip off my heels with some shoes but not others. They‚Äôre perfect with killshots but they don‚Äôt work with other sneakers (such as Stan smiths) or my llbean Blucher Mocs. In those cases they slip off the heel and you can see them in different places. These difficulties wouldn‚Äôt be an issue with the ultra fine merinos."
"I've honestly been getting happy sock fatigue (not the brand, but just all colorful socks). And I also realized I had no all black socks in my closet, just gray and navy blue. Trust me, my drawer is still mostly funky socks. I just wanted to chime in with a basic option."
"too fragile, cashmere nylon or straight cashmere is objectively better because it's a bit more durable but still incredibly soft. aka 3-6 month lifepsan vs 1-2

I have a pair (I guess two by my girlfriend stole the other) and haven‚Äôt had a single issue with pilling
"I haven‚Äôt had issues with pilling, although I have noticed that their socks with lots of colors will tend to have a lot of wool sticking out at the seams between colors. Usually just a razor is enough to trim it down but it is annoying. "
"IDK, my Chups are holding up well... although I guess I don't wear them too often."
"I've found the opposite. The Smartwool collab pairs I have pilled up pretty quickly, but I own a few pairs I bought 5 years ago that are as good as new. I think the secret with Chup socks is how you take care of them. Wash cold and hang dry. Safe bet for most clothes, I think."
"Maybe you guys can venture out to lifestyle stuff as well, since I'm sure everyone would love that, defo me at least"
"Ah my apologies, should have checked :)"
"Probably not big enough, sorry."
"I dunno man, they aren't comfy for me - yeah, they stretch, but they cut into my foot.  I don't have fat feet by any means."
"Yeah, the only places where I feel they don't work well is like white jeans, tan chinos- lighter stuff. But what's great about them is that they look fine with just jeans and sneakers but also nicely dress up a bit for stuff like chinos and derbies with an OCBD and so on."
"Oh yeah, good question! The 06, I'm fairly sure.

I bet 64 (called ""blue"", but looks pretty gray-ish) or 05 could work pretty well too. 08 seems too dark to be that versatile."
"I really do love them for late fall and winter wear. But I usually end up wearing through the heel after around 20-30 wears (could be my fault, maybe I'm washing them too often or not often enough)..."
"I like the idea partly just because we're a community of smart consumers with good taste, so even if they're somewhat off-topic, they're still going to be great threads."
"95 is also the grey color, but more of that pattern to it?"
"I have quite a bit of knowledge when it comes to pomades at least and combs, been having the same haircut for years with the undercut/pomp"

"I love loafers since I'm in a warm climate where they work as a three season shoe. Personally, I like the bulkier more American style that you can get from rancourt, bass, oak street etc. rather than sleeker European styles. They work great casually with shorts but really shine in business casual. Chinos, ocbd, and beefrolls are my uniform for sure. "
"Feel like in a lot of pictures, loafers look a little too sleek and pointy. Kinda throws off the balance of the outfit"
"I opted for Meermin's 'soft calf' loafer as a casual summer option. No break in required at all, comfortable from the get go. They run TTS. I like J.Fitzpatrick museum calf loafers as a dressier option, also TTS."
Think these are often overlooked by the young  crowd on this sub. Penny loafers are pretty much mandatory for business casual and in recent years they have become way more trendy then boatshoes. Don't let the frat bros take an incredible shoe out of your basic wardrobe. Not to mention once you break them in they feel like apart soo comfy!

The guy w/ shorts is the only exception I could find in the album, but he's lucky in having clear-ish body hair.. "
"I used to like them, lately I find that they don't looks good when worns with pants.

Personally i only recommend loafers with either shorts or cropped & taper jeans/chinos"
Lots of folks consider them gauche tbh 
"He mostly pulled from older, more verbose content from the sub. Has there been a prominent bit loafer post? Maybe someone should write one"
IMO they‚Äôre not versatile They‚Äôre what you throw on when you want to stunt whereas a good pair of simple loafers you can wear with anything - I have a pair of Gucci snakes and had a pair of the normal Gucci horsebits- I found that I had to wear solid colors everywhere else and never shorts with them or my outfit would be loud AF
Horsebit loafers are awful.

"They definitely have a break-in period, but once you get through that they're amazingly comfortable in my experience. Toss on some moleskin pads or socks and just wear them around the house for a little while."
"Because you don't have laces to dial in the fit like with a normal pair of dress shoes you have to be more careful with the fit of laofers. I made the mistake of wearing my new pair of tassles without socks (which I normally do) for the first time and that was rough, but after a 2-3 wears they are super comfortable."
"What brand did you wear? What kind of sole did you get? Leather shoes usually have a break-in. And leather soles with fiberboard heels are never as comfortable as boat shoes or sneakers. But they can be pretty comfortable, as long as you got the sizing right."
I couldn‚Äôt really do loafers on the regular but I got some camp macs with a rubber sole (no stacked heel) and they‚Äôre working out great comfort wise 
"Yes after breaking them in

I also bought some rancourt crepe sole loafers that were comfortable right out the box"
All depends on the brand. My Rancourt beef roll pennies are the most comfortable shoes I own and they've been that way since I took them out of the box.
My loafers now fit like a glove. Most worn shoe to work and I love to pair them with vibrant socks and I‚Äôm often complimented.

I really like American brands more than most European ones for this reason. Loafers seems so casual and comfy that the sleeker and [more chiseled](https://www.meermin.es/media/catalog/product/cache/image/600x800/e9c3970ab036de70892d86c6d221abfe/1/0/10148414860000SE-A_22.jpg) lasts from a European styling really don't appeal to me with loafers. Compared to [American takes](https://www.3akcii.com.ua/upload/stblog/1/5/5/55large.jpg)
"I think the sleek and pointy ones look cooler than the more casual, fuzzy and wider look. As long as their feet aren't so big that it creates a clown shoes look, which no one in the pictures really has.

"
"These look more like [Dress Slippers](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/70zm4i/i_am_getting_the_impression_that_dress_slippers/) because of how thin the sole is. I think they'd still work

These are apron-toe venetian loafers. I'd wear them casually. Especially with shorts to show off that band.
It's from soe shirt
"wouldn't sweat it that much. most dudes have leg hair. having tanned legs is a must though, pasty white milk bottles don't look great sticking out from under your pants."
Lot of folks will keep that opinion if horsebit loafers are omitted from op smh
"They're definitely tricky to wear, and a statement piece when worn well, but I don't think they're tacky, in the abstract."
I did write a bunch about them [here](https://www.reddit.com/comments/8ay05g).
"You‚Äôre definitely right. They gotta be worn with gray pants, (chinos or trousers) pretty much in order to work"
"I disagree. I used to think so, but I think with a gray unlined suit (think SuitSupply's Havana line), socks optional, they look dynamite. My work uniform is ""business casual"" which for most means suit without a tie, at the very minimum a dress shirt tucked into slacks. Horsebits work great in that context."
Those loafers are great! What particular ones are they?
"That's how I went. I got Cole Haan Nantucket loafers because they're comfortable, I had a $25 off $50 Zappos coupon, and they fit my far more casual prep summer style better than a stacked heel loafer does. "
He deserves it 
"I think the European loafers look better sock-less with casual, Italian style tailoring and the American and English chunkier styles look better with socks.  They are also easier to pull off with prep/ivy styles, imo."
"Absolutely. Something feels very dainty about a lot of the European lasts, e.g. the chisel toe and narrow aprons. It's not as bad as the continental European loafers, but I think even some of the English brands are guilty of this: [Edward Green](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0211/7958/products/P1080084_1024x1024.JPG?v=1524358164), [John Lobb](https://leffot.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/MG_3575b.jpg), or even C&J's deliberately American-style [Harvard](http://cached.bensilver.com/RS/SR/Product/82/8365b_R_20c9842d.jpg). Those styles, IMO, have a place in classic ""smart"" menswear but aren't terribly versatile or casual.

I recently picked up a pair of [Alden LHS unlined snuff suede](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0211/7958/products/MG_1755_1024x1024.jpg?v=1502846420), which I feel slot much better into a casual wardrobe than the European alternatives."
"Meermin has a bunch of their loafers in their Elton last, which has a pretty chiseled toe, I think even the one you linked isn‚Äôt as chiseled as they are. But yes I definitely agree for loafers the American companies seem to rock the round toe better."
"thanks for the help, I'll check out that guide"
"Not just the sole, but the thin seam and the smooth last. They're definitely loafers, though."
"ok thanks, shorts for sure, for pants probably skinny/slim chinos/jeans ?"
"Yeah I own a pair, they just seem out of place with denim where pennies work well. Probably the main reason For the preference here "
I mean you could say the same thing about crocs
"Traditional black with gray or black, but if you have a brown pair they'll go nicely with blues."
Hey thank you! They are Gucci horsebits from the Tom Ford era
"EG has the Picadilly, which I think is what you linked, but they also have the Duke on the 137 last. Much more American and casual in silhouette.

Also, I thought the point of the C&J Harvard was to be a competitor to the LHS? They are pretty similar in my eye, and don't suffer from being too sleek, chisel toed, or narrow aproned like the other two."
"> I recently picked up a pair of Alden LHS unlined snuff suede, which I feel slot much better into a casual wardrobe than the European alternatives.

the LHS are the platonic ideal of a casual loafer to me. especially snuff suede. I also have them in #8 cordovan but girl gave me shit for them being grandpa shoes and they're slightly too big for me.


i also have the C&J merton, which I wear to work with wool slacks sometimes, but they're defnitely more on the formal side."
Yeah. I'm partial to chinos. Gray chinos could work.
"> narrow aproned

It's not narrower but longer. LHS loafers have a shorter vamp/apron which is the difference I think /u/threeMileLongIsland is seeing. 

I think it's a solid pattern, but I like a shorter vamp/apron for casual loafers like the LHS personally."
"I've tried on both the Harvard and LHS. The Harvard's longer and has more of a pointy almond-shape than the LHS. I tried the Harvard on with a few different fits and I didn't feel that they worked outside of a an Ivy/European smart casual look (which I don't wear often). I ended up returning them. The snuff LHS, on the other hand, seem to pair well with everything from denim to shorts to casual menswear."
"> the LHS are the platonic ideal of a casual loafer to me. especially snuff suede.

I love them (and the snuff suede) so much , I'm thinking of rounding out my summer shoe collection with Alden's [snuff derby](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0420/0029/products/ALDEN-UNLINED-DOVER-SNUFF-SUEDE-29336F-2.jpg?v=1521522309). IMO, very few other companies do casual suede as well as Alden."
"thanks for the suggestion, I really appreciate it"
"Yeah, I didn't mean to imply the Harvard was narrow-aproned. But the last is definitely a bit longer/pointier than that of your typical American penny-loafer (I've tried them and the LHS on, side-by-side)."
I have those too. And the unlined chukkas in dark brown. Probably the most comfy pair of the bunch
"> Probably the most comfy pair of the bunch

The dovers or the chukkas?

Also, can I ask about you some questions about your Alden suede collection?

* Do you keep shoe trees in them?
* How did you size each pair compared to your brannock? 
* Did the suede stretch out a lot?  If so, did you size down to account for that?

I haven't had chance to wear my LHS (actually swapping them out wth a smaller size at the moment).

Thanks!"
"The chukkas are perfect 

I use shoe trees in all except the chukkas, don‚Äôt notice any wrinkling in the suede really.


I got the lhs and dovers off eBay, the chukkas in a store. Have never tried a brannock sizing thing, so can‚Äôt comment unfortunately 


Chukka 8,5 C/E - perfect fit
Derby 9 C/E - slightly roomy
LHS 9 B/D - slightly snug, mostly the vamp 
LHS cordo 9 C/E - slightly roomy


Also have long wings in kudu leather in 8,5 c/e and those are wider again.


Alden sizing is all over the place I think, the last and width matter a lot. 
In my experience with all kinds of suede shoes from different brands is that it‚Äôll stretch a bit, but not so much that I buy shoes extra snug to account for it. It‚Äôll usually only stretch where there‚Äôs pressure

"Was looking into serious running shoes recently and came across this debate time and time again: overpronator (flat foot) should use stability shoe vs overpronator don't need stability shoe (claiming there is no science behind the stability shoe).



But after every article or debate...there is no direction to point you into which shoe you should get. 


Like in the conclusion  of this article most people left it at ""So what should a runner look for in a shoe? Nigg‚Äôs research suggests that picking the most comfortable shoe is going to be your best option.""


But realistically, there are hundreds of shoes and when you try it on in store and pro runner shop, they are all more or less comfortable.


I ended up getting a pair of stability shoe and been fine since. Looking to pick up a neutral shoe and see how it goes.

Basically, there are ultra-marathoners out there who run 150+ miles a week ALL BAREFOOT and don't get injuries. This is what inspired the barefoot movement over the last few decades (also the book 'Born to Run'). However, these ultra-marathoners have been running barefoot their whole lives and learned at an early age how to run barefoot. Thus, people starting to run in barefoot shoes generally continue to run with improper form and get injured. That's why Vibram got sued and lost. 

Also, there are ultra-marathoners who didn't train barefoot their whole lives and still don't get injured. So who knows?

But are you less likely to get injured wearing $150 Nikes versus other comfortable shoes? I'm not sure there's great evidence that Nike's are much better, so the article probably has some merit.   "
"I ran for years in everything from specialty running shoes all the way to Van's. Honestly both felt about the same.

"I don't understand the need to 'shoe horn' (lol), people into one shoe choice.

I need to wear big thick soled Addidas to run and I have to also have inserts for the soles, because I have some disgustingly flat feet.  My GF has outrageously high arches and those bring their own complications."
Why are they so uggggly
"Am ultra runner, would not buy Nike. I do usually get top brands, but whatever is on sale. If you heel strike, get shoes with a drop (i.e. have a heel cushion). If instead you land on your midfoot or forefoot, you might be better with a low or zero drop (heel cushion the same size as forefoot cushion) shoe.

The rest IMO is all marketing. Science seems loose at best and far from settled, despite evangelists. I do have my favorite brands, but that's because they feel so damn good."
How the hell did you run in Vans?
"I have flat feet as well, but wear very thin soled shoes (border in minimalist) and sometimes remove my insoles. There's a ton more factors to consider than foot shape. I have a pair of Nike's I never use because the high is so high, I feel incredibly unstable."
"It's mostly a poor color combination. Fat sneakers will always look ugly, but the coloring makes them even more so."
Same way anyone would. Just start running. Humans been running for 2 million years with all sorts of shoes and without. 
Your feet are overpronating and not striking correctly when you run then.  You'll always been more.orone to stress injuries
I meant that they could‚Äôve very easily gone with a single coloring. If they were just decent looking like a pure black or pure white knit shoe they would not be nearly as bad. 
"I work out in Chucks Taylor IIs and do warm up and cool down runs in them. They're as, or more, comfortable than any ""running"" shoe I've used. Good form is more important the the ""right"" equipment. "

"Agreed.

I suppose some people want sneakers to be bright if they are running at night (reflective material would be better though), but I don't know why brands make so many ugly-ass colored models. It'd be interesting to know what generated the idea that sneakers need to be bold colored."

"I would consider an investment to be anything that will last a long time and age well due to the quality of the material, construction, etc. Things like suits, boots, or the AE shoes you mentioned. It could even be a belt. I consider the two Orion belts I own to be investments because in the past I would have never considered spending $50-80 on a leather belt, but now I am willing to save the money and make that purchase because I know it's a quality piece that will last a long time.

I can't figure out why all of the other comments are so focused on the definition of investment being something that gains monetary value over time. You made it clear that this is not what you meant."
Outerwear is an area worth splurging on. These items can be worn for years and years. Cheap versions are sometimes so sucky I don't *want* to wear them (besides when I absolutely have to) which in turn makes the asymptote of cost-per-wear (CPW) approach infinite cost and zero wears.
"The word ‚Äúinvestment‚Äù might suggest an item being a money sink, but to me, a wardrobe investment is simply something that you will reach for time and time again. And ironically this will sometimes include very basic items. So the choice is to either buy quality and keep it for ages, or buy lower quality (hopefully more budget friendly) and replace it with something similar when it doesn‚Äôt look so good anymore. The long and short of it is, everyone‚Äôs definition of ‚Äúinvestment‚Äù will be different. Expand or condense your wardrobe based on your budget, the climate and the overall style you want to achieve.

Just to put more info in, there are a few things in my wardrobe that have, or are predicted to persist for years:

- leather jacket (clean and lean cafe racer style like a Schott 641xx, bought second hand, more than 10 years old, already broken in and free patina from years of use)
- denim jacket (virtually any trucker will do, mine is a basic Levi‚Äôs collab but you can really splurge on raw selvedge denim ones from Japanese manufacturers)
- harrington style jacket
- minimalist thick wool winter jacket in grey, navy or black
- thick wool cardigan or sweater with defined texture and/or interesting hardware (eg. Inis Meain, SNS Herning, Inverallan etc)
- wool scarf (go louder and more interesting in pattern or colour to add interest to a winter coat)
- flannel shirt (choose a pattern and fit to suit, mine is cheap from UNIQLO but you can get Iron Heart ones, for example)
- plain solid-colour and Breton stripe long and short sleeve V and crew neck shirts
- light blue OCBD
- white dress shirt
- indigo and black raw denim (myriad of manufacturers, I chose two from Japanese manufacturer Tanuki, and I will wear them till I‚Äôm too fat or they fall apart...they just last and last)
- tan chino pants (take your pick of brand, mine is standard mall stuff and it‚Äôs still lasted me ages)
- navy and tan chino shorts
- solid coloured tailored beach or swim shorts
- plain white leather sneakers (numerous brands, I copped mine at Country Road for a song when on fire sale)
- brown Chelsea boots (choose your brand, eg. RM Williams, copped it at an outlet on less than half RRP, very minor defects on close inspection)
- brown oxford lace up shoes (I wear a suit only once a year and never anything formal, so I chose some Loake burgundy fullwingtip brogues instead)
- navy suit (mine is cheaper, off the rack, but altered in exacting fashion to fit perfectly)
- plain solid coloured tie to complement the suit (go with some texture rather than pattern), add a complementing pocket square (go slightly louder to add interest)
- sports watch (if you want to splurge, choose a brand and style that is always in demand and can be offloaded easily...my steel Rolex was bought second hand and worn for over 9 years, and today I can easily recoup what I paid for it)
- dress watch (same rule as above, mine is a vintage Jaeger le-Coultre, easily worth what I paid for it despite years of use)
- underwear and socks, goes without saying
- basic brown leather belt to match shoes (buy what you like, eg. UNIQLO on sale)"
Probably a quality mechanical watch.
"My investment pieces are all winter wear:

Stutterheim raincoat (I can realistically wear this all winter if I layer but sometimes I don‚Äôt want to wear a sweater

Billy Reid peacoats


My acne Isherwood denim shirt (warmer weather) and my Patrik Ervell denim shirt (colder weather - it‚Äôs incredibly thick and just now showing wear on the collar and elbows)

My Patrik Ervell bottle green puffer

Vince highline anorak

SNS Herning sweaters. I‚Äôm not sure how investment worthy they are but my todd Snyder knitwear has held up very well

I tend to spend more money than I should on items that I won‚Äôt wear often so I can have quality pieces when I need them such as:

Vince black hoodie that I use for traveling

Church‚Äôs captoe boots

Jeans and pants from officine generale Simon spurr Han kjobenhavn etc. 

Pants/jeans are not good investments but the quality is palpable and I love the colors on each of them 

A good shirt is worth it if it‚Äôs less than $75
"
"Assuming we're not talking about a monetary investment (as in hoping for the value to appreciate) and more about low cost per use (things that get used a lot and last a long time), I think a nice wallet is one of the best investments you can make. You'll use it every day for decades (if you don't lose it), and if you truly love it then every time you use it it will make you happy. 

I have a [Chester Mox no53 bifold](https://fromsqualortoballer.com/chester-mox-review-years-later/) that I absolutely love. Totally worth the price. 

Other leather goods like belts and briefcases can be good candidates too. I bought three belts seven years ago and probably won't need any more for at least that much longer. "
"Not sure what you are asking for here. Suggestion on something expensive that is worth it? Something to increase in value(basically nothing clothing wise)?

A decent leather bag(portfolio or whatever model) for work is something that is very expensive but that you use every day for many years.

Edit: to add. I'm not sure that I understand what you mean by saying you invested into footwear by buying a pair of AE. Again, you wont make money from them, so not an economic investment in that sense. Investment that you paid for a pait of shoes that you can use, sure, but that is any purchase...just that there are good and bad purchases."
"High-end dress shoes and suits and leather jackets mold to your feet/body over time, and that's a plus. But they also wear, so they're probably still worth more out of the box, if that's what you mean."
"Pretty much anything you buy for your wardrobe won‚Äôt be a true monetary investment. That said, in the spirit of what I think you meant, I would recommend quality accessories that aren‚Äôt subject to fashion trends. These can include: recraftable shoes, mechanical watches, full grain belts, quality glasses, etc... "
"Yes, nearly all clothing will depreciate in value.

As for reducing cost per wear, try:

‚Ä¢high quality tanned leathers (i.e. from Horween) for your shoes & belts‚Äî at the lowest prices you can find.  Avoid a lot of cemented shoes

‚Ä¢Wool & linen garments are also (generally) longer lasting than cotton.  I also highly recommend nylon & nylon blends.  Synthetic Cordura & Schoeller fabrics kick ass.

‚Ä¢Look for double & triple stitching.

‚Ä¢Really want some bang for your buck?  Buy a sewing machine & some Kevlar thread.  Learn to hem, taper, and stitch a simple hole.  YouTube guides make it easy.

"Having made an entire wardrobe according your needs.

Having the optimal space for everything you have will allow you to better organize your clothes, help with storing them better, etc"

"Investment items for me are:

Sneakers I would wear anywhere, are really well made, and I identify with (for me that's raf simons, speed trainers)

Dress boots or military boots

Nice fall coat / winter jacket

sweatshirt / crewneck that I can wear every day of the week."
"I treated building my professional wardrobe (a rotation of suits, shirts, and ties) as a proper investment.

Part of the reasoning for that is:

1. I am a researcher associated with a law office, and I am involved with cases, so I need good clothes to wear during the working day and in the instances where I go to court;

2. Suits are expensive enough that what I get needs to be comfortable and last (so, I wouldn't touch an expensive Super 140 because I need the fabric to not be fragile); and

3. By buying multiple suits that I can put into a rotation, the attrition on each individual suit is reduced.  So, yes, I'm spending money up-front, but I'll be wearing these suits for years without having to buy new ones, I will be able to send one to the dry cleaner without affecting the rotation, and dry cleaning will be able to happen once every 6-12 months instead of once every 3-4 months."
"Anything you can wear for multiple years without looking silly is a good investment. Quality blazers, suits and wool coats aren‚Äôt subject to huge changes in trend from year to year and they can last a while if you take care of them and keep your weight under control. By spending more money on quality items once, you‚Äôve saved your future self from having to buy cheaper versions of these items every year.

The converse of this is that, unless you‚Äôre wealthy and prices don‚Äôt matter, you shouldn‚Äôt splurge on items that don‚Äôt last as long, either because they wear out quickly or because they‚Äôll look silly and dated in a couple years."

 I always recommend buying expensive but well made iconic clothing. Shit you can wear for the rest of your life. I have some Italian made boots I've had for 15 years. Had them resoled 3 times. I think I paid $600. I keep them polished and the leather looks beautifully worn but not cracked. Brooks Brothers Golden Fleece suit I've had for 10. Paid $2000.

If you are spending the money on shoes save for something better than Allen Edmonds. Aldens are much better.
"Just examples:

* A denim jacket

* A solid pair of jeans.

* A canvas jacket

* Boots made using goodyear/Blake/stitchdoen/etc. construction

* The underwear that's perfect for you

* A hefty winter coat

None of these will appreciate in value, of course, but you'll get great use for value.
"
"Boots &  Shoes: just be careful. They can be addictive. I bought my first pair of AE a year and half ago. I have more than 7 dress shoes and 3 boots. They are absolutely amazing. If you can afford it you should buy the matching belts and by all means get the shoe trees.

High quality leather jacket is a very good investment and should last for years.

Grey/navy suits should also be high quality."
"I think the main garment that I don't mind spending more on than I usually would is a good coat, as a good quality one will generally last me for up to 4 or 5 winters. 

Maybe it's a bit of a self-perpetuating cycle, but even things like Jeans I'm reluctant to spend *that* much on, as they still tend to fade and will already look noticeably 'worse' after only a week or so. "
"these are usually econimcally speaking correctly classified as consumptions, not investments. unless you are buying collectibles and keep them in the box to flip them for a higher price in a few years. or maybe you buy a suit to get a job/make more commission etc. that is also an investment, because you hope to get back you money. common items would be: nice shoes, suits, ties, buttoned shirts etc. but the item is unimportant. your intent is what matters.

tldr: whether something is an investment or not primarily depends on whether you hope to make money off it or not. "
"I had a cull of my wardrobe about a year ago and it never felt so good. I only kept essentials and only the pieces I really loved/ I got down to about 10 tees, 5 work shirts, 3 casual, 3 sweatshirts, 2 jeans,2 shorts, 2 swim shorts, 5 trainers, 2 shoes and 3 jackets

Through doing this I have released what items I personally found worth investing in, which are below (pleeeeease adapt this to your style, what your version of work wear is and for your climate)

Sweatshirts- Worth the investment, for me I have 2 APC and 1 norse projects. They are all 3+ years old and still look brand new, still warm and comfy. Buying a lower quality would have meant that these got thrown away in the initial cull and would have lost shape and warmth.

Tee's - Unless you have a massive budget, are super brand loyal or have to have the latest collection, I wouldn't bother. I threw away sooo many expensive tee's, and kept the mostly plain ones as they go with every outfit. H&M ¬£4 lasts for 6 month, throw it and get another one.   Or wash your favorite T wrongly, stain or tumble dry it. And thats ¬£50+ down the drain, which will probably loose shape just as quick as the cheaper ones.

Jeans- No question, invest. I had about 10 years of buying average/below average jeans and they all me feel like crap. I then got some black Acne jeans and some APC petit new standard. They have lasted me 5 years so far, yeah the APC have had an inner pocket fixed but thats all. Oh and I always get my jeans taken up by a tailor as most stores do not do the size I need. That is a ¬£10 investment that lasts the lifetime of the jeans. I have never wanted or needed more or different jeans from the ones I have, 1 black 1 navy. Job done.

Work shirts - If you have to wear them I am guessing they are smart and you have 5 wear them 5 days a week. So you better get ones you like! I don't mean spending ¬£100+ per shirt. I mean going and trying on loads of brand, colours, cuts and sizes. That is the investment you need to do here. Not throwing money at them I ended up getting a 3 pack from Next of white and a 3 pack of light blue for ¬£45 per pack. Never needed any other shirts.

Casual shirts - I personally don't wear these often so they are not an investment piece for me. But if you don't need work shirt then just apply they work shirt to this. All I did was get nice, clean, plain, simple, well cut and fitting button downs. One in navy, light blue and a pattern. I thin 2/3 are Farah and 1 is Levis

Shorts - Depending on how often you wear them you could invest, but IMO they are not jeans and no not need half the attention that Jeans need. Just make sure they are well fitted and can be worn with everything. Any store that does the chino style shorts will be fine. Having a little logo on the hem of your shorts means absolutely nothing.

Swimming short - Least attention unless you have the body of a god and you live on the beach. 

Trainers/sneakers - You can live with these 3 pairs for the rest of your life and you would never look out of place. A white court shoe, from stan smiths to common project just apply your budget. Converse, I am not saying any more. Sports looking sneaker - this totally depends on where you live and the local style but think Ultraboost (personally best trainer ever owned), air max 1, air max 90/95, air force 1, adidas NMD etc.

Shoes - Invest for sure, 2/3 pairs. Black formal, brown loafer, then boot/desertboot/boat shoe. I have had shoes for over 5 years from russel and bromley, I wax them and get them re-soled when needed and they look brand new still.

Jackets - Depends on where you live and what you need a jacket for. If it snows 99&#37; of winter, I don't need to tell you to invest. If it's only every rainy then a rain mac of any sort will do, northface, stutterhiem etc.

The only other things I invest in are aftershave, nothing worse than looking good and smelling bad, and an umbrella! A cheap umbrella will blow out at the first bit of wind. I have had a Fulton umbrella for 7 years, cost about ¬£20-35 and it has never failed me once.

I hope this helps! Any questions just shout.
Edit: added underwear and socks

Underwear- invest for sure, feel good look good. There is a reason brands like CK have such a grip on the underwear market, they are quality and worth buying. Unless your 15 old battered, printed underwear is a no no. They can get pricey but what I did over a year is buy 1 pair a month and throwing 1 old pair out. Then a year later I have a whole underwear draw which is sick.

Socks- you wear them everywhere and if you have old crap socks then your best shoes feel crap. If you live somewhere hot get 100% cotton from somewhere half decent, if you live somewhere hot, then thick gym socks all the time. Do the same as underwear where you get 1 packet of socks a month for a year. I would stay away from things like happy socks or expensive branded socks as they are normally overly printed and will not go with your whole wardrobe."
"High Quality Leather jacket. I was looking at a couple of Schott jackets the other day, you can just tell they're second to none in terms of quality. "
I view an investment piece as something that increases in sentimental value and physical beauty rather than monetary value. Because of this I've invested a lot in leather outerwear partly because I love the patina an animal hide develops over time and also because it fits my lifestyle. I hope to pass them on to my son or daughter some day and for at least the sentiment to hold its value.

"Very few watches actually appreciate, and it can be difficult to predict what will and what won‚Äôt. Never buy a watch hoping to make money or break even. "
*takes out mortgage to buy a Patek Phillipe*
"I'd make the argument that even if one discounts the financial appreciation, a quality watch is one of the few things in men's fashion that can be passed from one generation to another, as with women's jewelry. So in that sense it can garner incredible familial and emotional value."
"That's only one side of how investment is defined, though. The OED also defines it Investment as ""a thing that is worth buying because it may be profitable or useful in the future \[...\] **‚Ä¢** \[count noun\] an act of devoting time, effort, or energy to a particular undertaking with the expectation of a worthwhile result*""*"
"This is probably the best answer in the thread. Investment implies it will age well. Specifically a nice leather jacket, nice selvedge or raw denim, a nice watch (like really nice like IWC, Rolex, AP, etc). 

Underwear and shoes may not appreciate in value, but it‚Äôs definitely something that‚Äôll get its value‚Äôs worth of wear. A suit is something that can last a lifetime with proper care, and you‚Äôll be really glad you have one when the situation arises. The same goes for a great coat."
"Can we stop pushing Naked and Famous already? Japan Blue is a better product for the same money, gives you an easy route to upgrade via other Japan Blue Group brands in the same cuts if you decide raw life is for you, and frankly the low rise and tight pockets on the N+F pants I own make them incredibly inconvenient to wear. I'd say pretty much the same of any other American raw denim. Too much money for too little payoff."
"AE and Meermin are always called entry level for GYW shoes, but they're some of the best value propositions in the category. I prefer Carmina and Alden, but if you're a normal guy that wears oxfords to work everyday, you can't really go wrong with a solid entry level GYW shoe. Just rotate them and show them some love. AEs can last well over a decade with proper care. "
"I would argue about a pair of nice denim. Sure we all know you can re-dye or repair them if needed, but I really don't think it's a good investment unless you are into sic fadez. A pair of Uniqlo probably can be as ""durable"" as an expensive pair of jeans or close. "
"I'd exclude leather jackets from that. No one outside of actual bikers or actual punks was wearing stuff like double riders before 2014. And the styles of those change over time. Sure, some of us inherited double riders from Dad, but most of us [inherited these timeless classics](https://img.etsystatic.com/il/00bf42/1165976968/il_570xN.1165976968_ezw8.jpg?version=1), if not [these bad boys](https://blog.gotstyle.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/10yr_mens_jacket_lg.jpg)"
"This. I spent some money on a private white VLC wool shearling bomber a few years ago and it was absolutely worth it throughout the two winters I‚Äôve had it. 

I looked very stylish. If not for my personal tastes shifting to the darker, more DIY aesthetic, I would‚Äôve kept it no doubt. 

I could‚Äôve had a Uniqlo one. I probably would‚Äôve liked it, but I would not appreciate the way I did my PWVC bomber. 

The tricky thing is when you‚Äôre starting fashion, do you really know what you like? Have you ever paid attention to the different kinds of clothes you‚Äôve liked? If not then maybe it‚Äôs time to do a little Style discovery before splurging on a thing like common projects Achilles. Or a rick Owens leather jacket. Spending money won‚Äôt make you look good, but spending money when you know what looks good on you and what you like can make you satisfied and develop a sense of style. "
"I think OP is asking for suggestions on things that are worth splurging on and not about items that will gain monetary value over time. Difference between colloquial usage and textbook definition of the word ""invest""."
"Yeah, I guess sewing machine might be added! Not only can it make worn out clothes last longer or be converted into something you'll wear again (long sleeve button up shirt with worn sleeves into a short sleeve, fitted button up), it also allows you to buy a lot more high quality clothes for cheap from the thrift and make them fit better. "
"So we are in the process of having our cellar converted into an office, a guest room and a dressing room with walk-in wardrobe space. Should be done by the weekend....I'm unfathomably excited!"

you mean sketchers and socks with soles? :P"
you are a college student that drops $750 on a pair of sneakers. christ almighty
it's all about rotation. saves you so much in the long run not to wear the same thing over and over. This goes double for shoes.
"This is why I tend to spend my money on items I wear less. They‚Äôll last for years and they‚Äôre there and look good when I need them

IMO on gear you‚Äôre going to run thru and wear hard you can go cheaper. I‚Äôm a big advocate of spending as little as possible on solid color button downs for the summer and buying shorts etc from target on sale. They‚Äôre going to get destroyed in the heat and activities and you can always just buy another pair next season "
"I disagree. Allen Edmonds are in a completely different price range then Aldens. And the durability is not that different. You're really paying a premium for ""better"" designs and slightly better quality materials. Either shoe will last a similar length of time, and both will probably look good. "
*stockpiles killshots*
"it's pretty easy to predict for pateks, there's always huge demand for them, and if you get them at retail, you can ALWAYS get more than what you paid. Obviously, I'm talking about 150k+ grand complications and repeaters, not 20k calatravas."
‚ÄúYou never actually own a Patek Philippe. You ~~merely look after it for the next generation~~ **simply will never be able to afford one.**‚Äù
"The sad thing here is I have to disagree. Yes it can and often is, but more likely than not style has moved on and that watch is likely too small or too big or something else. I wanted to buy a watch I could hand down to my kids then I realized they won't care outside of the ""it was my dad's"" and leave it in a jewelry box somewhere for fear of breaking it. Nah, I'm going to buy my boys a nice watch they can wear proudly if and when they graduate college or something. All my grand and great-grand parents stuff is currently languishing in a box somewhere sadly."
This is exactly the thinking I had when making the list. 
"it's just a suggestion, nobody is pushing anything. "
"Sure we aren't confusing N+F and Nudie? I don't own either and can only find Nudie jeans locally. They pop up in thrift stores from time to time, and in varying states. But at least from what I've read, N+F is definitely good quality for the price. Nudie, not so much. N+F may not be the best value proposition in some opinions, but they're definitely not bad at all. They do seem to have some novelty fabrics, not really my cup of tea, but some people like them."
"It doesn't have to be a double rider, and leather jackets hit mainstream appeal (including double riders) way before 2014. And personally, I don't think they will stop being stylish any time soon."

"Why would you not wear it for fear of breaking it? That's like not wearing clothing for fear of staining it. It's an acceptable risk. You can fix them if they break unless it's an absolutely insanely valuable watch. You can insure a watch of almost any value too, no different from a car.

Trends changing is another matter. But you can do that with careful selection. Most Rolex models will never go out of style, especially if you buy a midsized version. For example, [here are some watches from the 80s and 90s that will always look good](https://imgur.com/a/jRenQDC), some cheap and some expensive. None of them are too big or small today. Meanwhile, [here are some 80s and 90s watches that got dated quickly](https://imgur.com/a/Bpcsk4q). So don't chase trends. If you're worried a watch might be too big in the future just go smaller. 35-39mm dressy watches and sport watches up to 40mm have never gone out of style."
"Trends can always shift towards what your watch happens to be, though. Like, yes big watches are popular now, but you never know if it'll shift towards smaller stuff in the future.

Alternatively there's people that will wear it regardlesss of whether its currently ""cool"" or not and still be stylish. Ryan Gosling wears basically only vintage watches which are generally pretty small.

And as the other guy said, certain styles are pretty classic and dont really go out of style. People have been wearing certain rolex styles for a long time now."
"Not referring to you, just the sub in general. Most of us aren't /r/rawdenim loonies, but unless you browse that sub N+F seems like the be all end all of raw denim, when it really falls flat as a value proposition for regular raw denim jeans. I'm just tired of seeing an overpriced brand with mediocre fabric and construction being pawned off on unsuspecting /r/mfa initiates as though it were the de facto best option, when it is most assuredly not. 

/rant

Of proper Japanese pants, I dream of my ONIs at night - but for a gateway drug I will stand by Japan Blue."
"N+F isn't terrible, it just has a lot of features (uncomfortably low rise, high pocket slits, extremely slow fading fabric,) that make it unsuitable for an entry level/basic pair of raws. I own a pair, and I think they're really more of an acquired taste. I frankly find most American raw denim brands to be a poor value proposition, and of non-Japanese brands I find N+F to be one of the most appealing. Their more interesting fabrics are often a better deal than buying standard raws there."
Not ones shaped like garbage bags.
"You can see the little shower room and the walk-through of the wardrobe in my WAYWT pic for today! I'll give you the full ""cribs"" tour when the other side of the camera doesn't look like a building site. "
naturally 
"yep, but you gotta wait at the minimum 5 years, preferable longer before you sell them if you get them from patek themselves instead of through an AD, because, well, you'd get blacklisted for flipping them."
"Not OP, but I always fear scratching the case or crystal of nice watches. Are these irrational fears?"
"Naked & Famous is respected because they're willing to do crazy shit with their product and not really care what people think, and they're pretty accessible/engaged with the denim community. N&F gets recommended on MFA because it's budget raw denim and a person can reliably pick the appropriate cut for their body. Conversely, most of MFA will balk at Pure Blue Japan or even Momotaro prices.

On a personal note: of my current rotation, my N&F MiJ are probably my favorite / most worn pair. N&F makes really good jeans."
"Noted for personal reference, thanks! "
Ugh. You don't have to be a loonie to appreciate fashion. You can spend like 10 minutes looking shit up and be done. I did that shit and I almost never have to buy jeans. I've got a pair of Dior MIJs that are at least a decade old and they look and feel amazing. 
"well, of course."
"On a nice watch? Yes. Almost all modern watches that are ""nice"" have sapphire crystals that you can almost guarantee will never scratch. The crystal is probably the part of the watch you should worry the least.

[Example](http://i42.photobucket.com/albums/e304/ColMiller/Precista/Dreadnought/sDNXtalScratch1.jpg). This guy on a watch forum was surprised by this scratch, but also look how beat up the stainless steel on his watch is - because he uses it for diving like it was meant to.

On a vintage watch, the crystal may be acrylic, which is easy to scratch but also easy to polish (a $5 tube of polywatch has lasted me years and keeps my vintage rolex in perfect shape). And in the end the crystal breaks it is very cheap to replace.

Other watches are mineral/hardlex crystal which is somewhat fragile (it's basically glass), but you really only find these on cheap Orients, Seikos or Timex and the like."
"N+F gets recommended on MFA because it was one of the earliest brands to reach that relatively low price level that most MFAers feel comfortable paying for a pair of raws. Most /r/MFA subscribers are not /r/rawdenim acolytes, and I can only assume they just genuinely don't know enough to formulate their own opinions. 


N+F's problems as far as entry level denim brands go include; uncomfortably low rise, oddly high pocket slits, basic/boring fabric on the standard model jeans, lower quality construction than same-price Japanese jeans, and extremely slow fading. 


If you want an interesting pair of jeans from a wild/oddball fabric like the Elephant X's, or the various colored/stretch/hemp/kapok/silk/special limited edition jeans, and you don't mind the cut, N+F makes sense. If you just want to get your first pair of basic-ass raw jeans to get some fadez on, you should go with Unbranded, Sage, or Japan Blue. 


And yes, their MIJ is an incredible pair of pants with many FOTD posts on Heddels. But it is also IIRC not in the basic beginner price range, and not what is typically recommended my MFAers. 


It makes way more sense to send people to Denimio and tell them to talk to the support line for recommendations. They don't need to drop a fat wad of cash on PBJ, Oni, SDA, or Momo to get a decent pair of pants. They would just be better served not buying their first pair of raws from N+F."
I don't think you actually follow what I was saying. 
"Not to mention, you can always get them replaced.."
"The best I've seen is to wear clothes that fit. Make sure shirts aren't  to billowy. Wear dark wash jeans.

Also, the way you physically carry yourself (posture, eye contact, and a friendly smile) will project far more than just clothes. A confident man in jeans and a t shirt will be more preferential than a mealy mouthed, skittish man in a $3000 Gucci suit. "
"Oh, wow.  What I would give to have your problems (I'm 41).

Look, the truth is that you ARE still a kid.  That's not meant as an insult - just an observation from somebody who has just started his fifth decade on this rock.  When I was your age, well, I had some of the same feelings you do now.  Today, I know better.

Maturity isn't something that you can really create by dressing for it - it comes from life experience.  Each challenge you meet and overcome adds a bit to it.  And, eventually, though it all, you gain perspective, and that's part of maturity too.

Looking good in your clothes is very much about being comfortable in your own skin.  Getting clothes that fits helps too, but a lot of figuring out your personal style is figuring out who you are.  And that takes years.

As far as transitioning to adulthood without pain...I don't think that's possible.  There's a great bit in Westworld where Ford comments that self-awareness comes from suffering, from that sense that the world is not as it should be.  So much of coming into adulthood follows that model too - your failures, lost relationships, and setbacks matter at least as much as your successes, if not more.

But that's philosophy - you're at the beginning of what will hopefully be a very long and exciting road as you live your life.  Don't try to rush forward - speaking as somebody in their 40s, I really wish I had been gifted with more time to enjoy my 20s and 30s.

Seriously, if you can get away with still being a kid, DO IT!  It's a damned sight better than being an adult."
"I would wear stuff in the casual-but-mature realm. Dark, well-fitted jeans or chinos, basic casual button-down shirts in chambray, denim, flannel, etc. (Think stereotypically ""blue collar"" stuff"")

Shoes go a long ways too. A basic brown chukka boot or a casual derby won't read super dress-ed up but is a more mature look than sneakers.

And finally, just keep moving ahead with your life and don't be to hard on yourself. You'll be significantly more grown into the ""adult you"" before you know it. Fake it 'till you make it."
"There are a few easy improvements to common things which I've seen, without knowing your routine wardrobe: don't wear runners with pants, start wearing belts, try working in more flat-front chinos, consider an entry-level watch. Button-downs are generally a good move. Given your height, well-fitting pants are probably the first thing to take care of. 

Also, don't forget about the rest of your appearance. Investing in a regiment like Proactiv or X-Out (essentially the same, but cheaper) might well be better than spending more on clothes at this point for you. If you can't grow facial hair, maybe it's not worth trying. Working out is great for aesthetics and helps to develop the sort of mental fortitude which will allow you to pull off any outfit. Working on inner confidence and speaking skills, too, is invaluable in both social and professional settings. 

Best of luck!"
"Two simple suggestions for you: 1)Wear clothes that fit, and 2)Be a smart dresser.

1) Fit. Pretty straightforward and I'm sure every other comment in here mentions it, but it goes beyond just spending more time in the dressing room when shopping. Learn your dimensions and then take into account that all brands of clothes and shoes are different and may size differently. Finding brands that work for your body type is huge. I'm 5'10"" and slim but athletic and and almost anything from Uniqlo fits my shape. When all your clothes fit right I'd say you probably look better than maybe 75% of guys out there. But knowing your size/shape, where to shop, making adjustments to clothes if need be, is not as easy as it sounds and takes time and thought...thus why it often makes people look more well put-together and more mature.

2) Being a smart dresser. This is basically just being aware of and considering the weather, your environment, the occasion (if any), and any other factors that might affect what you should be wearing. Every morning I check my weather app and quickly plan what is absolutely required for the day's weather. Or if it's the weekend and you're going to a concert at night but only after spending a day out then maybe figure out an outfit that works for both occasions. Or wear an outfit that works during the day but bring a jacket along for the concert that works with the rest of the outfit. Also sort of common sense but along the same lines, you don't want to be the guy at the wedding with jeans on or at the BBQ on a sunny day in too much clothing sweating your balls off. A little forethought and preparation goes a long way towards being comfortable, feeling and looking smart, and coming off more mature. I think people can tell when you put thought into what your wear and your appearance in general.

Sorry for the short essay.

"You've gotten good advice in this thread. To add on, I'd say check out some WAWYT threads and see what you like. If you want to look older than your age (or, just more deliberate in your choice of clothes), focus on clothes that fit and start off with more neutral colors (dark denim, shirts that are navy, grey, white). From there, you will naturally be able to build outfits from your existing wardrobe and you can branch off into more adventurous stuff (if you want to) because you'll have a solid base. Also, be situationally-appropriate and keep your clothes clean. A HUGE difference is made when clothes are clean and fit. I have all my jeans tailored (hemmed and  usually tapered), and to me it makes the difference between looking like someone bought me my clothes because I don't care about how I look vs. not."
"I‚Äôm 37 but I had the same problem when I was 18. I looked like a kid no matter what I did, and adults treated me like a kid, and I hated it. There‚Äôs really not a magic wand that can make you look older. However, I know it seems like a long way away, but your 20s really go by in a flash and your beard will fill in and your body will fill out, and then one day you‚Äôll be married with two kids and the summer interns will start at your job, and you won‚Äôt understand how you went from being an intern to being one of the condescending middle-aged guys who treats interns like kids.  But by then the interns will look and act like kids to you and you won‚Äôt be able to help yourself.

Honestly, no matter what you wear, adults won‚Äôt consistently treat you like an adult until you‚Äôre about 25.  And then you‚Äôll have about a five year window until younger people start thinking of you as an old person.  We all play many roles throughout life, so try to enjoy the role you‚Äôre playing now."
"This is going to sound like a cop out, but since you have wonderful genes, take advantage and enjoy it. I'm a blink away from the big four-O and still get a thrill of bouncers stopping me outside a casino or a bar to check my ID.

Money don't buy class. Age don't buy maturity.

Maturity is life experience, and your level of maturity should not only define how you act and carry yourself. It defines how to react to people and situations in your life. It doesn't hurt to be childlike in some ways. Don't be quick to lose the child in you."
"A lot of good suggestions, but a nice haircut will also go a long way in making you look more mature and older "
"You look and sound young because you are young. You‚Äôre 18, you‚Äôre still growing mentally, thus ‚Äúmaturing‚Äù. "
"I‚Äôm 6‚Äô3, fit,  almost 10 years older than you and still have the same problem. Once you get older and your friends are losing their hair, have wrinkles and generally look like crap you won‚Äôt be so worried. 

Being your height and fit means that basically no clothes are made for you, unfortunately. I think that can work against you and make you look even younger. Don‚Äôt underestimate a good fit. 

I would suggest buying a nice pair of light and dark denim, a pair of chinos and some nice button up shirts you can dress up or down (oxfords). Take all the new clothes to a tailor and get the right fit. It took me until this year to understand how big a difference that makes. Good luck my man. "

This isn't quite clothing related but have you tried minocycline? I had the same problem with acne and it cleared things up really quickly.

"I'll repeat what others have said, fit is probably the biggest thing. Second would be simply workout and focus on the shoulders. Shoulders are the one muscle thats highly underrated and makes everything up above look bigger. 

Last suggestion would be to try a watch, an older more classical style. Not one of those large bands etc. Try a simple design a leather band. Those things really bring some class and most guys these days don't wear due to its lack of use but its a fashion accessory. "

Black or navy is a solid choice with a dark grey suit depending on the leather colors you plan on.

To be helpful for the future, Kashmir is a region in India and Led Zeppelin song. Cashmere is the highly regarded fabric your suit is made of."

"One last tip, don't be afraid of mixing patterns. If your suit is solid, maybe try a windowpane vest. If your suit is patterned, go for a solid vest. Just be aware with any additional patterns of shirt/tie/pocketsquare as to not overdo patterns or pattern match.

I also do not plan on wearing this jacket for very long because I am gaining weight and a form fitting leather jacket will soon cease to fit me. With these conditions, would it be a smarter decision to buy a faux leather jacket with the intent of experimenting.

The m5 line which is the low rise slim fits me well enough without being too skinny. The best part about the jeans is a lot of them are selvedge with a wonderful amount of stretch in them that retains its original shape.

"Do you tuck the end of a belt into the pants loop? I have a new woven suede belt and it's not necessarily too long -- the end goes 4"" past the belt loop -- but it's a little floppy at the end. It leans forward a bit. If I tuck the floppy end into the pants loop, it solves the problem if there ever was any. But I've never done this before.

I've heard that Indochino can take \~2 months to deliver. I've also heard that Indochino MTM often requires re-tailoring when you receive (Big risk if my wedding is in 2 months).

"First things first, Rome is a city of anciently-clad stone pavements so you want as comfortable shoes as possible. Good shout on rubber soles as leather slips like hell (been there, not cool if it happens to you). 

Also, said stone gets HOT, so 27 degrees will feel full on 27 and higher in Rome. You get a lot of shade in the side streets, but main squares are all in the open and they heat up. 

Otherwise the plan sounds good. I personally tend to pack an extra shirt over a t-shirt and an extra chino pair instead of jeans for Italy. 

And don't forget a belt!

People here would be glad to give fit feedback if you want an outside opinion.

Figuring out outfits is similarly largely practice.

I believe that context is an often neglected part of when an of when an outfit is tight. You don't need a lot of new information about when to wear a suit because it's been around since the beginning of the 19th century. Compare that to something like ""palewave"". People want to see it.

Maybe wear a light windbreaker from nike or some other similar brand. I have a really thin hoodie from hm I bought like last year 
The easiest example is that most mall brands are overpriced and should only be bought on sale if you want to get your clothing for a price more appropriate for the quality.
"No simple answer, because things are always changing even within brands.
The only way to really get a good grip on what's worth it or not is having a lot of knowledge on what to look for. for instance, i recommend looking for natural fibers or materials (cotton, linen, hemp, wool, silk, cashmere, down, leather). Even within that, there are different grades of materials and levels of care required, as well as cost (eek).
complicating the issue is that synthetic fibers can be useful. polyester can be good due to water wicking properties or nylon being a pretty tough material or elastane (spandex) making some articles of clothing much easier to wear (looking at you denim jeans).

Then there's the construction - double or triple stitches just do a better job. the weave of the tapestry makes a difference on the quality of the product. Funny that oxford cloth is widely regarded as a staple around here, but it's an inferior weave in terms of longevity. (still a great weave, and you should take people's advice to get it). it just excels at cost.

tl;dr it depends and you need have your own metrics for what's worth it and what's not."
"As far as logo embroideries go, I like Paul Smith polos (animals), Maison Kitsune (fox), The Kooples (varied, bout you get TK woven letters a lot), Lacoste (rawr it's a crocodile), Brooks Brothers has a nice logotype as well actually, AMQ has a very cool interwoven logotype as well these days, I am a fan; Fred Perry laurel logo is cool, AllSaints Ramskull can be an option. "
"Original penguin, farah, lyle and scott"
J Crew.  Most major companies sell some kind of a plain khaki short. 
"American Eagle sells these flex shorts that look really nice (in my opinion) that are comfy as fuck. I actually use an older pair for work (I work outside, hiking trails, using a chainsaw, etc) and they are my go-to short for that. "
Banana Republic.  Abercrombie.  Brooks Brothers.  
Club Monaco does some nice shorter swimsuits.  Orlebar Brown if you want to drop a little more change. 
"A&F and J.Crew have 5"" shorts.

"How do you generally dress, and what sorts of shoes do your co-workers wear? My initial response is to suggest a suede leather shoe (chukka, maybe?) in a sand or tobacco, which tend to look mature without being stuffy, but those may not mesh well with the rest of your wardrobe. Alternatively, gray sneakers tend to match everything."
"Getting minimalistic skate shoes in white (and keeping them clean) gives you a casual shoe that looks more mature and you can dress up a tad (think casual button-downs with dark jeans), and it wouldn't be a big change.

As others have said, chukkas are a nice step up a bit if you want that."

"I wear GAT's with chinos and a button down.  I think clean, white, minimal sneakers are good with that type of outfit. "
"Tons of resources for jeans here my friend, just search jeans in the search bar.

That said Naked & Famous, Japan Blue"
"Yes, they are my favorite shorts."
Uniqlo and Naked&Famous both have lots in 28 waist.
"How much are you looking to spend? Many Japanese denim brands go down this low. Uniqlo goes down that low, but I'm not sure how accurate that is. 

FWIW, if you get something unsanforized, or really most nice denim, will shrink a bit/not stretch as much."
"Good old Levis has jeans with a 28 waist.

I know J Crew has chinos in 28, no sure about jeans."
"What are you trying to buy?  Just jeans, or other things too?

Buying online helps; Levi's for instance sells all their stuff in 28, but you're unlikely to ever find it in a physical store.  That tends to be the case with a lot of other manufacturers, too, although some just don't make stuff under 30 and I have to cross them off. :(

Dress pants for whatever reason tend to be much easier to find in 28.

Every now and then when I can't find something in my size, I order a box from Stitch Fix and tell them precisely what I'm looking for.  I spent a couple months trying to find grey flannel pants in a certain price range, for instance, and couldn't, and then they sent me exactly what I was looking for (and when you buy something, the $25 styling fee gets applied to the purchase price, so it's essentially free help shopping)."
The first pair
Those are nowhere near too short.
Not too short
"That's my preferred length and it seems to accentuate your legs. If you're uncomfortable with the looks, you could probably go 9""."
Forget sizes and just go by measurements 
"I'm not a huge fan of brand logo shirts, but I think it'd work fine with most chino shorts."
Jeans or dress pants?
Measure yourself normally and your best fitting clothes
"Go get measured from a tailor, itll be a lot more accurate "
Adidas Continental 80's. I have a pair I like them. 
"Depends, what kind of graphics are you interested in? I'm partial to Uniqlo U and Undercover. "
Budget is probably important.  So is the type you're looking for - do you want cutesy?  Funny?  Abstract?  Band?  Travel/location?  Political?  Branded?
"You're probably going to struggle to find anything of decent quality at that price range, (In the US, at least, around $55 is where the first worthwhile mass-market sneakers start to show up) so your best bet is to hunt through end-of-summer clearance for a pair of white canvas sneakers with vulcanized sole. 

If you're truly urgent, you can shop mall stores for a cheap pair but they're going to be uncomfortable and short-lived. "
Just go on ASOS and buy whatever off brand plimsoll fits your budget.  Really not much else to say with that budget (no hate) lol
"Won't be that cheap, but Converse is phasing out the Chuck Taylor 2 line, which means cheap prizes at outlets or online stores. There's a white low top, and the build quality is better than regular Converse."
"You might be able to find a pair of the Keds Champion canvas sneakers or Converses at that price on sale, although it's tough if you're looking for a specific color."
"The sidebar's ""basic bastard"" wardrobe is a pretty good resource for what you're looking into, but here's a TL;DR:

\-Button-up shirts in blue and white, most frequently of an ""oxford-cloth button-down"" pattern (OCBD)

\-Dressier flat-fronted pants in khaki or gray or dark-wash jeans in good condition

\-Brown oxford shoes or dress boots

\-A quality brown leather belt to match said shoes

If you want, you can always add a blazer, with or without tie, to dress the outfit up a little further"
Budget? 
lol dude just walk into your local j crew and purchase them
Go look at his current suits to get his jacket size
Compare your measurements to garment measurements. Height and weight don't mean much.
Sleeves are too long and overall fit seems boxy
"I'd try a slim fit in that current size and also a slim fit in a size down. Are you also wearing a Long, at the moment?"
What items are you specifically looking for?
Just out of curiosity what size are you for outerwear?
"I don't know how stylish this is, but when you reach up for anything, the sleeves won't expose wrist and I value that in outerwear."
"If you‚Äôre not in a rush, because they ship in October, I recommend these Beckett Simonon‚Äôs Reid Sneakers [here](https://www.beckettsimonon.com/products/reid-low-top-sneakers-white-leather?variant=7227407958046)

They‚Äôre around the same price as the Vejas after you apply their 20% off coupon"
"I tend to think leather sneakers are a bit dressier than canvas ones.  That lead me to go with leather for similar outfits as you mention.

I ended up buying [these guys from DC](https://www.zappos.com/p/dc-reprieve-se-white-white/product/8997513/color/1001) that are more along the look of the Veja's, and I'm pretty happy with the look.  Another option that I liked a lot were the adidas superstars in [skateboarding](https://www.zappos.com/p/adidas-skateboarding-superstar-vulc-adv-footwear-white-footwear-white-silver/product/8809452/color/705700) and [non-skateboarding](https://www.zappos.com/p/adidas-originals-superstar-2-white-white/product/7599376/color/1001) varieties, though they're not *quite* as clean as the ones you're looking at."
I'd go for the Veja sneakers. You can dress them up a lot more than you can the canvas Vans.
"How tall are you?  Next level 6440 was perfect for me.  I'm 5'9"" (175 cm)."

Check out Alden.

"cotton-silk blend shirts are light and v soft (in a sleek sense) - I have a few from YSL. 

cashmere t-shirts may not be the lightest, but they are definitely the softest by far. 

In general, I really like Sunspel t-shirts for plain basics. The feel is great."
If you want something you can wear at all conditions then you really want a shell+layers.
"Both look fine, but I'd go with the all white. The last Vans I bought had the black line glued on, it was very thin and started peeling after a month, and that looks kind of ugly."

"That's the norm, some more avant garde stuff plays with hanging belts"

I skipped the mink oil. You could condition them before first wear because you don't know how long they've been around since manufacturer. I'd use something like Lexol and would condition maybe once or twice a season. 
"I think it honestly depends on the condition of the leather. If they still feel good and aren't dry, I'd probably skip until it needs it."
"It is easy to apply too much mink oil, and it darkens and is sticky. I‚Äôd pass on that unless you plan on wearing the boots for non-fashion purposes in harsh conditions. A light conditioner like Lexol isn‚Äôt going to do any harm out of the box. "
"Start here for skin care.

https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/"
"I think it‚Äôs not worth the price but skincare is always equal parts body chemistry, luck and snake oil.  If I was going to fork over a lot for skincare and wanted a one stop shop I would go for dermalogica myself."
I use a lot of Kiehl's products and the Ultra Facial Oil-Free Gel Cream is my daily moisturizer. I even have one on my desk at work. Skincare is pretty experimental so it's worth trying a few products out to see if they have the effect you want. I have a friend who works for them so I get to go to the employee store but I would buy these products at full price since they work for me and skincare is one of those things that I don't think people should cheap out on.
I would much rather have diadora or spalwart shoes because of their rich history
"I've heard good things about Greats but nothing about their runners. For that price you could get a lot from other brands, though. You may find a Nike Internationalist or Vortex. Alternatively, adidas will produce a lot of sneakers similar. There's a lot of sales on right now so it's worth looking around at other options."
"Look for a light wash pair labeled as a straight leg. 

Levis 501 is the classic."
Which yeezys? 500 or 350?
"Are we talking wool or cotton pants? If wool, less than $100 per pair might get dicey. If cotton, then you could shop j crew at full price and still be under $300. Bonobos makes nice dressier cotton pants that I suspect can be had for under $100 too. "
You can have them hemmed.
Just try another brand. There are so many out there.
Just one piece of advice: make sure your new clothes actually fit properly! That‚Äôll make all the difference. Even generic clothes will look better when they fit right.
Do you have a budget?
"Post a thread this isn‚Äôt a simple question given all the questions about your occupation, the aesthetic etc - tbh, to answer your question, can you go wrong with a classic denim shirt or flannel?"
Ask ssense.
All jeans will stretch over time and slightly shrink after each wash before re-stretching.
Sounds like you should try another fit bro.  Size down in the waist with the tapered fit river or whatever it is.

One pair of good more expensive shoes is better , for example, than two pairs of cheaper ones. This is a mere guide for what I'd do, and with things that pop to mind on a first thought. Remember that accessories matter a lot - and I mean everything that isn't an item of clothing. Choose quality over quantity always.

"There's still ways to incorporate streetwear into a maturing wardrobe. Look for the plainer items rather than the in-your-face branding and perhaps start to tone down the colours. Supreme, for example, have a load of really nice items that aren't hyped because they're not emblazened with logos but they're still very much streetwear. 

You can still wear sneakers, too. Again, tone down the colours and go for something that is a lot more wearable (think your classic runners like New Balance 1300 etc).

The most important thing is going to be fit. Streetwear tends to be oversized so just by wearing items that fit to your body you'll be looking more mature.

I don't think you should give up your whole identity just because you feel like you need to as you get older. You'll end up hating it and it'll always feel forced."

If you want a name, they're forward (direction of pleat, forward pleats are British while reverse ones are more American/Continental) single-pleated wool trousers, probably flannel though the texture is hard to see. Simple, though yeah a lot of high street stores won't carry them because most men are still traumatized by the old NEVER WEAR PLEATED PANTS memes from a decade ago. "
"Pretty much anything. I'd recommend white, gray, light blue or other pastels. Avoid black and any shade of blue that's too similar to the pants."
"Good choices!

I like the first one the most (loooooove yellowed dials and blue hands, hell I'm bookmarking that one), but it'll also be the least versatile because it won't go very well with a black strap and therefore not with black dress shoes.

The second one is a bit more neutral than the third, but the rose gold hands imo make it look more interesting and it will go with pretty much the same stuff as the second. So choose the one you like more.

"I was thinking wool, but honestly unsure of what the true benefits between the two. Basically it's: Wool = warmer & cotton = more breathable, right? Planning on using the pants year round & live in a state where temps get to mid-90s in the summer & typically highs of ~35-40 in the winter"

"Yes, on low heat. I haven't noticed much shrinking"
"Ok I think I get what you're saying. Sort of like, you don't want to feel alienated for dressing in clothes you actually like? Man if there's not a dress code in place, do exactly what you like. If it really bothers you to go all out, just take small elements from your inspiration rather than the whole look.

Just curious, do you feel that dressing well also means fitting in?"
"Maybe. Cotton shrinks most when it has never been washed before, but I would imagine it already has been. Hot water wash cycle and putting it in the dryer are your best bets if you're okay with putting the garment at risk to do so"
Maybe. It might not if it's pre-shrunk or was cut with shrinking accounted for.

"Look for ""The Ives"" it's the widest leg they have."
"The classic fabric for a navy blazer is hopsack. Basically you are looking for some texture. This is what makes them slightly less formal than the worsted wool fabric of a business suit.

Single breasted, notch lapel and I‚Äôd stay away from metal buttons. Keep it simple and  middle of the road with regard to lapel width and other dimensions. This results in a hugely flexible jacket that can be dressed up and down loads of ways.

Can‚Äôt help you with brands, wrong country.
Fit is so important with tailoring, so I wouldn‚Äôt try to make a surprise gift btw."
"Unless it's a really really expensive jacket, it probably isn't worth it to alter that much tbh"
Slim doesn't have to mean you can't move. There's far too much room through your body on this jacket so a slim would definitely do you better. There will be plenty of options (although I'm not familiar with either of those you listed as I'm not from the US) so you'll find one that'll fit you well enough that small alterations can be done at a tailors rather than an entire jacket reconstruction.
"Well basically you need to find out what works for you, but here's what I do when it gets cold.

Upper body:

Long sleeve shirt, usually an OCBD or flannel

Sweater layer. I usually wear a sweater, but that could be replaced with hoodies, fleece jackets, etc..

Outerwear of some form. Depending on the weather you can forgo this, but as it gets colder I tend to wear heavier jackets as opposed to what I would wear in the fall.

Lower body:

Pants:

This is personal preference as to what you wear. I wear midweight chinos for the most part, and these are the same pants that I wear year round if I'm not wearing shorts. Additionally, I do have a few pairs of colder weather oriented corduroys, but those get worn less frequently.


Footwear:

I wear bean boots when the weather's foul, but the rest of the time I wear a leather pair of dress boots that suffice. Really this is up to you and you could get away with something like vans if you wear warm enough socks. 

---
Without giving an exact budget and style that you like it's hard to give recommendations on specifics, but one thing you can do is hit up thrift stores looking for out of season items.

Ninja edit: [Here's a link to the seasonal guides in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/wiki/guides#wiki_seasonal_guides)"
"Cleveland gets wet and sloppy so I would not rely on sneakers. Boots with some traction are best. Wool is your friend for the other clothes, and down is too. I prefer a couple of layers to one big parka. "
https://www.ssense.com/en-us/men/product/31-phillip-lim/white-surreal-squirrel-floral-box-cut-t-shirt/2693678 .  There is another version that is black with owls instead of squirrels but I feel like it might be tougher to find.
"The word is ""blazer,"" not ""blazzer."" And you'd be surprised how many stores think that any semi-formal to formal jacket is a blazer. 
I've seen tons of orphaned sport coats labeled that way. "
Depends on how much water proofing you really need and budget
Nope?
"I have one I like and can't ever find a reason to wear it.

Definitely depends on what you do."
"If you‚Äôre applying lexol or something similar, an old t shirt should be fine. "
"Personally I wouldn't wear khaki with those, but lightwash blue and black should be fine"
"If you want to do year round wear, two and two would work if it‚Äôs a dressier office. If it‚Äôs more casual, I‚Äôd probably opt for three cotton and one wool. Wool trousers tend to be dressier than cotton, but there are of course exceptions. I would take a look at j crew‚Äôs offerings since they are generally inoffensive, regularly on sale and fit your budget. If you don‚Äôt like them, then start looking at non-mall brands. "
"I would start with researching beyond MFA to see which styles you gravitate towards like streetwear and find stores that cater to that style, like H&M or ASOS if you like streetwear. I can‚Äôt give you anymore info since you didn‚Äôt provide enough specifics."
"on the spectrum of formality I'd say that denim shirts and flannels are about the same level as polo shirts (but without the preppy connotations of polos). One up from a t-shirt but certainly not overdressed, imo. Denim and flannels are, after-all, ""workwear"" and can be worn in loads of styles spanning from a clean, minimalist style to a punk/grunge/rockstar style. So they are pretty versatile."
Either you wear only XS or S or XXL upwards. Otherwise I ask you to find anything decent that they still have stock of between Medium to XL
It's only a matter of time before Nordstrom's infinite return policy is changed
Probably a chest tattoo tbh.
"You'll probably be fine with the silver, it's dots on a tiny accessory that you didn't even notice when you bought it. It's not like you bought a silver jacket. 

It's not about how bad it's made, it's that 99.99% of pre-tied bow tie knots are too perfect, too stiff, and too symmetrical. They're super easy to spot. If you're avoiding a cheap look, avoid pre-tieds. The elegant asymmetry is what makes real bow ties look so great imo. Like a necktie dimple. "
"> The vest is the exact match to the corresponding dress pants

Then they'll match. 

And I apologize if I came off as berating.  I did not mean it as such. "
"You can do it yourself in 10 minutes or pay $10-15 for a tailor to do it.  Everyone should have a sewing kit though and you can get one for $15 on Amazon that has everything you need to do it. 

And for what it's worth, if your sleeves are hanging part way down your hands, your sleeves are too long.  "
"If you are going with a seersucker, just wear a plain white button down shirt.  It's already a slightly casual suit so you can do no tie if you want with just the light brown shoes and belt.  If you want a tie, maybe a linen tie in a pale pink or something like that.  Don't worry too much about her dress, just don't specifically try to match her colors or anything like that and you'll look fine. "
"They have cheap wool suits and haven't been any problem to me though. If there were no negative reviews regarding customer service and we were talking strictly about price/quality, what would you're opinion be? "
"Cool, both ideas are right up our alley."
"I have often felt insecure and have done my best to dress as if I want to NOT stand out so no one gives me attention. I also sort of felt if my personality was good it shouldn't matter.

Now I want to sort of reinvent myself and I realised I actually care about this stuff and was really inhibiting myself on the aesthetic portions of life.

I don't like business casual and prep school clothing. Basically, clothing associated with being rich and elitist. (I also looked into bohemian clothing which is TOO down to earth so I guess my thing is sort of on the lower end of this spectrum but not too much).

Earlier I actually didn't care and just bought whatever my friends said looked good and I trusted their opinion.

Right now I think I love muted tones and clothing that gives off a sense of melancholia."
"Oh, I know. But still, you've got this nice ensemble you've put together and it creates this bizarre, jarring visual from top to bottom. You've got your perfectly coifed hair, your nice shirt, belt, pants, then -boom- tennis shoe surprise!"
"One size down (48 to 46), and I can barely move. Feels like I'll rip the jacket.

Edit: Also, could it just be my body proportions? I'm 300 pounds at 5'11"" and have a fat waist. "
"Yeah, but the problem is their chart doesn't make sense: It says 1 is small, but small is usually it 46, and then they have it 48 there... so if I'm usually small/it 46, I don't know which of these to rely on here."
How is it in the seat and thigh?
"Thank you, really appreciate the advice!"
Amy thoughts on Indochino? Might be a good option for a custom fit. 
Thanks for the help!
"Did not know how wet it would be, thank you!"
"Budget is 300 and waterproofing isn't really an issue, just a nice looking parka with warmth."
Oh... I've always been under the impression i SHOULD get a blazer
"> Definitely depends on what you do.

I don't do anything lol"
Thanks.
"Awesome, thanks for the advice. I just graduated and don't start work until September so not really sure what the environment is like. Appreciate the help!"
"I wear M and size 8UK shoes which are pretty damn common.

It‚Äôs been on for like a month and a bit so it‚Äôs ofc too late now. 

A third of my wardrobe is bought on their sales so there‚Äôs that. And no I don‚Äôt camp the website at midnight or something. "
In tribal style lettering. 
This entirely OP.  Do not wear a pre-tied bow tie.  The real deal is so easy to tie and looks sooo much better it isn't even funny.  Either switch to a standard neck tie or get yourself a legit bowtie. 
"That's a bit like saying ""aside from the mass killings, genocide isn't so bad.""

You're purchasing a suit sight unseen with little fit information, a record of misleading statements on materials, construction, and details, with no way of predicting when or if it is to be received. I'd rather purchase in person at a fast fashion retailer at a similar price point, spend more, or thrift/ebay."
"If I'm wearing chinos and a simple button down 90% of the time, then of that 1/2 the time I wear a clean, white sneaker anyway.  It works well, it's not jarring.  If I am wearing nice shoes, and want to go feed the ducks at lunch and stroll through the woods trails, then I put on my sneakers for that.  Doesn't really matter it's just for comfort and for not messing up my dress shoes.  I wouldn't do it to ""walk to meet a client"" or anything.  

At the end of the day, if you are holding so strictly to these ""rules"" and always maintaining a ""look"" at the cost of some comfort then you're doing it wrong anyway.  "
"You're like me,  I'm a 43.  Most makers do 42 and 44.  Luckily brooks brothers does a 43.  I'd try other brands.   They all cut a little differently.   Keep trying and you'll find the right brand.   Focus on fit in the shoulders and chest and tailor the rest.   You'll have to tailor. "
They provide measurements for trousers not in sizes but in cm/inches. Go with that. 
"Front rise: 10.75""
Knee: 18""
Bottom opening: 16""

Inseam: 34""
33"""
"Really the whole shells+layers thing means your jacket is just a shell and then you add layers when you need more warmth. I would check out TNF, Patagonia, etc your standard outdoor brands."
"Nope, if you need something formal for events get a suit"
"You should get a blazer when you need a blazer, if you buy one today and don't wear for 2 years. You change, styles change and what you like today might not be what you like in 2 years. I would just get one when you need one."
"Well you must have been lucky then. This sale, along with the previous one, I went on their website one day before it launched and already dozens of items were out of stock. And I too am a Medium."
"> At the end of the day, if you are holding so strictly to these ""rules"" and always maintaining a ""look"" at the cost of some comfort then you're doing it wrong anyway.

Fair enough. :)"
"Problem is, on a very tight budget. Maybe around 250 for jacket and trousers combined"
"Ah k so shell parkas aren't a thing right? Reason I wanted a parka is how I like the style, fur and how you can just put it on with a t shirt for easy warmth so I'm not sure if I want a shell but I'll check it out."
Lucky over a 100 times then! Last sale had mediums quite a bit in my impression. This one was meh in general so its hard for me to judge in that matter. 
In the future you should keep checking back.  They continuously add stuff to the sale section and restock a lot of the returns sometimes even at lower prices.  A lot of the first major drops are like piranha pits but even 12 hours later it‚Äôs easy to find new gems.
Look at sale racks and thrift stores. 
"There are. And no jacket is good for all conditions, if they change you have to layer for warmth or find a cooler jacket."
"Got a jacket from goodwill, but shoulders don't fit the best. Will post pic later. Plus, had no matching trousers, and is striped. "
Yeh it's hard finding a good jacket to invest in 
"Shoulders are the part you can't really fix without dropping big coin.  I do a lot of ebay searching for jackets.  Find a jacket that fits your shoulders just right, doesn't matter on the make or model.  Lay it flat on the table and measure across the shoulders to the top seams where it meets the arms.  You can take that measurement to Ebay.  Almost everyone selling blazers and suits posts those measurements along with armpit to armpit, length of jacket and length of sleeve.  You should be able to get a suit for less than $100 that way or a blazer for $25-75 that you can then get tailored for roughly $100-150 and have it been bang on.  But the shoulders are the biggest key.  "
"Unfortunately, never found a suit where the shoulders fit. Think the one I posted was too big? "
"I think the shoulders on that one are pretty close. They aren't perfect, but pretty close.  From the looks of it, and it's not a great picture but, it looks like the chest can be taken in, the waist can be taken in, the arms shortened and tapered.  If you're on a time constraint than that is probably a good option if you can swing the tailoring.  As it is now though the body/arms all look big and doesn't fit right.  Did you try on different makers in the same size?  They all cut different.  "
"Yeah, I literally tried every one in both stores previously mentioned. Claiborne in the pic seemed to fit the closest. All had far too big sleeves, and all had loose chests (but any smaller, and I can't move and the back pulls hard). I know I need a smaller chest, but even a 46 makes it so I can't even do the hug test, as the suit will tear. "
"Maybe u should buy a tape measure, and less how to take the measurements so I know what to look for. And I think that's really the problem: I don't know what to look for. I've seen photos of shoulder divots in isolation, but don't know how proper shoulders are supposed to look when you move. "
"What fit were you wearing?  You may be able to move to a more ""full fit"" at a 46.  Sometimes they call them ""traditional"" or something like that.  

Otherwise I would say for now, since you have time issues to go with that one and tailor the body/arms.  "
"> how proper shoulders are supposed to look when you move.

Once you move all bets are off.  The whole shoulder divot thing is for standing with your arms at your sides.  Moving changes everything and you shouldn't worry about that part.  The shoulders you posted look really close.  That's why I agree that you are in between sizes.  Lay the 48 down and lay the 46 down and measure  the width of the shoulders and armpit to armpit.  Now you know that your ideal size is right in between that when  searching on ebay.  I have some makers where I wear a 44, some a 43 and some a 42.  But that doesn't matter anymore because I am looking a the shoulder and armpit measurements before bidding/buying.  "

it really is! hoping to find more like it
Target has great fashion sense so I take this as the highest compliment kind sir

Thanks CP! 
I have put 4 large phones in them comfortably with plenty of space left. Massive pockets. 
Thanks mga! Appreciate it :) 
"Thanks, the shadows do make the pants a shade or two darker than they actually are but I agree ideally a lighter grey or khaki would look better, just don't have any that are as flowy as these. Thanks for the feedback!"
"These are the skinny lin's. I don't know the color name off hand. I bought them on sale only a couple weeks ago. I normally wear the tight terry's which have become my favorite skinny jeans, but these are strong contenders. "
"Thanks! I like these alot, they're a canvas/linen blend. They shrunk a bit in the wash, but the website advised that would happen. I also go them tapered, as I generally prefer a slim fit."
They're [these](https://www.gap.com/browse/product.do?pid=320802142&vid=1&locale=en_US&kwid=1&sem=false&sdkw=color-khakis-in-slim-fit-with-gapflex-P320802&sdReferer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gap.com%2Fproducts%2Fmens-slim-pants.jsp) i believe

"Cool, I was really self conscious about it but I didn‚Äôt have a belt at the time :0."
Thanks man!
Thank you!
Thanks! I'll experiment with different shorts then
"Yep! We started quite early in the morning (~4:30am), so it was a lot cooler haha, others on the trip did think me a bit mad though!"
"Cheers dude, fixed"
"Hm the lighting might be a bit misleading, the pants are a saturated brown, but dont really have a red hue to them. they certainly arent burgungy."
"yeah, when it's time to retire a pair of unis chinos, why not get some more life out of them as shorts. makes sense."
i cant even imagine life without gv and gb
In that case my critique is that you need to have more colors. Good day sir.
Gotcha. I still think the pants could be swapped here to great effect!

**Worst.MrP.Sale.EVER!**

Seriously, winter one had me slapping myself away from my wallet so not to cop amazing knits, t-shirts, trousers, shoes, etc. 

This one was... MEH. A bunch of hyped up stuff that wasn't hype enough to sell out, a bunch of abysmal fugly sneakers, and just a bunch of uninspiring stuff. 

There were a few things that I thought would be good to have (nothing I would consider re-adjusting my budget for), but they either had crappy discount or weren't that interesting on second thought. 

TLDR: Bank Balance - 1 // MrPorter Sale - 0"
"13 orders from 6/11 to 7/10. I was grouping my stuff until it was being bought right out of my cart so I'd just grab something and buy it before it got swiped and figured I could return it.

Most is getting returned, but this is what I got (sorry for the ALL caps just cut and pasted):

EDIT: Forgot the order the started it all!

EDIT 2: Updated with all the returns
"
"I was looking at getting a new wallet. Got a Balenciaga wallet. I was looking to get a new sweatshirt for some of those lazy days. Got a Reigning Champ sweatshirt. I was looking to get a short-sleeve floral dress shirt. Didn't manage to find one that I liked within what I was willing to spend. Instead I got short-sleeve Norse Projects dress shirt. 

The only other things I wanted to get was a pair of dark-colored chinos or some slim black denim. 

"
"I bought a bunch of things (5-6 pieces) like a month ago and none of them fit, so I returned them. That was my Mr Porter sales experience. Just my luck I guess. Agreed with /u/trend_set_go that it was underwhelming. Will wait for winter.

I did get stuff from Need Supply and APC, each of which had their own sale."
"Did anyone think Mr Porter's packaging has taken a nosedive? Two of my boxes arrived beat to heck, one basically so there was a hole that someone could have stuck their hand in and pulled out an item. I can't even use them to return. The third one was OK, good enough to use for returns, but the tape job looked like how it is when I try to tape things, bunched up rather than tight and straight."
That sale would have done some damage to our bank account if my CFO didn‚Äôt put me on a cop freeze. They had some amazing sweaters and patterned cardigans I was after.
"Good post, as I got my order yesterday and have been thinking about what I should keep and what I should return after putting $750 on items to try out. I'm definitely returning a Gitman Village shirt in XS. I wear XS in J.Crew shirts, but the Gitman XS is a lot smaller. I think I'm going to keep [this green Beams sweater](https://www.mrporter.com/en-us/mens/clothing/knitwear?soldOutId=936872). It's only $50, it fits well and I like the melange with the lighter and darker greens providing a visual texture. I'm leaning toward keeping [this Anderson's blue suede woven belt](https://www.mrporter.com/en-us/mens/accessories/belts?soldOutId=943454). The fit isn't the best. The end portion just goes barely past the loop.

I'm on the fence with two items. This [Officine Generale burgundy merino wool sweater](https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:eV0uT-6w_8IJ:https://www.mrporter.com/en-gb/mens/officine_generale/merino-wool-sweater/949053+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us) and this [Missoni space-dyed cotton hoodie](https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:F26MG3h4h9gJ:https://www.mrporter.com/en-gb/mens/missoni/space-dyed-loopback-cotton-jersey-zip-up-hoodie/981170+&cd=8&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us). I'm linking the cached versions of those so you can see the item description and pictures. It's annoying how Mr Porter doesn't let you view that for items that are sold out. I like the fit and look of the Officine Generale sweater, but it's a little basic to the point that I'm not sure it's worth the $118 with tax. For the Missoni hoodie, my main concern is that I'm 40 years old and have never worn a hoodie. Is now really the time to start? My general reasons for not ever being a hoodie guy are that I don't think it looks good to wear a hood and wouldn't want to mess up my hair in doing so. So then what's the point of the hood being there? I see potential negatives in that people could pull on it or stick things in it. And, at 40, am I too old for a hoodie? I'm definitely a young 40 -- no kids and never plan to have any, fit, live in a downtown LA highrise, 30-year-old girlfriend -- but I don't know how much longer I'll be able to say that I don't look 40. The girlfriend says that she thinks the hoodie is too casual for me. She says I never wear t-shirts, which I think is a strange thing to say given that I wear henleys half the time. She seems to think henleys are a step above t-shirts. I put in the order for the hoodie because I like the look of it, and in person I like the fit and feel of it. I could definitely see throwing it over a henley to walk out to pick up dinner or go grocery shopping. With tax, it came to $273. I was surprised to see that it was made in Romania rather than Italy, so maybe the mark down from $780 is not as great I deal as I thought. Should I keep it and see if I can become a hoodie guy, at least for a particularly cool looking hoodie, at age 40 or send this thing back and give my wallet some relief? Does a hoodie you're never going to use serve a worthwhile stylistic purpose?

Oh, I also got two Incotex bathing suits. I don't own a bathing suit, which shows you how much I use them. But it could be worthwhile to have at least one. Here's the two that I got: [red and gold](https://www.mrporter.com/en-us/mens/incotex/slim-fit-short-length-printed-swim-shorts/1004676), [brick and blue](https://www.mrporter.com/en-us/mens/incotex/slim-fit-short-length-printed-swim-shorts/1004680). They both fit well, but a little pricey at $70. "
"Mr. P summer sale is quickly becoming the clothing version of the Steam summer sale. I bought a pair of Yohji cropped trousers I had wanted for a while and thats it.

I did however cop a few things in the End and John Anthony sales that I'm pleased about."
"Waiting for my want les essentiels [backpack](https://www.mrporter.com/product/1011368) (247pounds) to arrive. These are slightly on a higher side of my budget but so lll decide on whether they are worth to keep once they reach.

Also this [Engineered garment shirt](https://www.endclothing.com/us/engineered-garments-short-sleeve-camp-shirt-s8a04170.html) which were a little long. Might have to get them altered. Any advise on how camp collar should fit?"
"pair of orslow 107 jeans and suede CP achilles. (UK site)


already did most shopping for summer earlier on, so i didn't go crazy. "
"Scored 3 pairs of Common Projects for about $850. Chelseas in grey suede, Achilles Low Retros in white, and Achilles Lows in black suede. Very satisfied overall!"
There‚Äôs a chance where the unsold our stuff in the US will pop up in the UK site. 
"I totally missed the Tom Ford card wallet and I'm so pissed. Was $75 down from $250 and was waiting for it to drop. oh well, now I've got to find something different."
Yeah I'm hoping winter has some of the new season stuff from some of the designers that switched around recently like Clare Waight Keller from GV.
All mine have come pretty perfect. Maybe UPS gave it a good kick?
Mine had the wrong name on the sticker :(
Saved by the S/O!
"You could have told me the hoodie was Merona instead of Missoni, and I would have believed you.  Not one of the better pickups from that brand IMO, especially at that cost.  Beams sweater is a yes, as are the belt and OG sweater."
"First, always listen to the girlfriend. So that hoodie gets returned. Like those swim trunks. I mean come on go take a trip to Hawaii or Vegas and hit the pool. 

Also don't discount kids. I had my first at 41 after saying no way ever and it ended up being the best decision I ever made (as I sit typing in bed with my second one next to me) That said have lots of happy childless friends so YMMV.

I figure this if I'm tortured over keeping something I just return it. There will always be more clothes and more sales."
"Personally (this is coming from a 17 year old so take your grain(s) of salt accordingly) i don‚Äôt like zip up hoodies. If I‚Äôm wearing something with a zipper i want a jacket since the appeal of hoodies to me is to be all comfy and cozy and zipperless. That said, your hoodie is about 8x more expensive than any of mine, so it may be an entirely different experience. "
"The thing with END for me is the the crappy return policy for the states. International returns must be covered by the customer so that is a basically a no go for me. 

Grabbed some kicks on a steal from END awhile back and they were just a bit too big and basically still have them since it wasn't worth the return."
Camp collar fits flat and wide. I tried some and found out it wasn't a look for me.
"> orslow 107

Didn't know about orslow. Will have to check them out."
Nice! getting your shoe game on.
I wish I were allowed to drown in a sea of retail therapy instead. Haha!
"She likes it, just not sure it is for me. Of course, she also thinks henley's aren't casual. She actually put it on and liked it for herself! That's the opposite of me. I'm just like returning is such a hassle, might as well just keep it. But I am already going to be returning a couple things."
End clothing still has a couple orslow items on sale.
"I wear mostly GYW shoes for work and school, so my previous sneaker game consisted of a beat up pair of Stans and some seldom-worn converse. Both pairs of Achilles feel like solid long term replacements for these. The white retros can dress up nicely, while I would not have attempted that with my Stans. They have a certain ""mature"" look and feel. The chelseas have been great as well!"
"the guy who wrote this sucks 

EDIT: thanks for the gold! "
They are nice but I feel like they‚Äôre a bit hard to pull off sometimes. I really do need to get one though 
I don't have anything against these shirts but 90% of the time I see them in public they look kinda ridiculous to me. 
I like them for the summer. Fun shirt to thrift. Hardest part for a skinny guy is that most of the shirts are square. It's hard to find shirts long enough to reach your waist without feeling like you're swimming in fabric.
"I didn't think I would ever wear Aloha shirts, but they have grown on me.. Along with the brands listed in this article, I'm also the big fan of the Wacko Maria if anyone wants to check this brand out as well."
"Check out Sig Zane, or Reyn Spooner, both out of Hawaii. I‚Äôm from Hawaii so I‚Äôm kinda biased though too "
"Yass. At first i wore them ironically, now i love them. "
"The three best Aloha shirts I've found:  
[Freenote ripstop Wave shirt](https://freenotecloth.com/collections/wovens/products/hawaiian-pacific)  
[Gitman Vintage Fuji Crane Blue](https://gitmanvintage.com/products/blue-fuji-crane-print) / [Gitman Vintage Fuji Crane Brown](https://gitmanvintage.com/products/brown-fuji-crane-print-camp)  
[Nine Lives Ascension Island](https://ninelivesbrand.com/products/ascension-island-aloha-shirt-long-sleeve)  


Any suggestions for similar style ones?"
"Step 1: go to savers or Goodwill

Step 2: look through the plethora of vintage aloha shirts

Step 3: aquire several of said aloha shirts for <40$

Step 4: wear with shorts 

This is how I aquired my summer outfits "
[this shirt](https://www.avantishirts.com/collections/men/products/ehukai-cream) from avanti shirts is really nice.
Harry Styles
"Man, articles like these remind me that I live in a different world that the rest of fashionistas. The day I shell out 45 clams for an ""affordable"" Hawaiian shirt will be a cold day in hell

You can find shirts like this for 15-20 without too much of a struggle. Not to mention they're one of the easiest pieces to thrift"
"I have friends who love them and can absolutely pull them off, but I personally have never really been one for shirts with ‚Äùcrazy‚Äù patterns such as that are on Hawaiian shirts. More a plain person meself"
In love with this [one](https://www.bladeandblue.com/collections/short-sleeve-shirts/products/new-gold-floral-stanley) 
AllSaints are killing it with their Hawaii shirts. I almost bought every shirt from their collection.
"The irony of these is long past dead...  Enjoy while it's still fashionable,  because I can almost guarantee that by next year aloha shirts are out"
"Man, this is crazy. When I wore these shirts in middle school (like 14 years ago?) kids would laugh and make fun of me. Now I see them being worn everywhere. I once tried one on at a store and got PTSD flashbacks to 7th grade. "
That Gitman Vintage & Prada foookn hell matee
"I miss being able to wear my dad's old vintage Hawaiian shirts, but alas, I am taller than him.

I still can't find shirts like his old ones though.  The prints were done on the inside of the shirt, which gave them a relaxed, faded look.  The buttons seemed to be made of some kind of wood, and the shirts only had 3 or 4 buttons.  It gave them a breezy feel that was nice on hot days.

I can't bring myself to wear the loud aloha shirts they make now.  They just don't compare."
"Aloha shirts are generally a little much for me in both pattern and tone, but I wear this one all the time: 

https://imgur.com/a/cTbzAmn


A little bit of extra charm, for me at least, is it's authentic Hawaiian, purchased by my grandfather when he was stationed in Hawaii way back in the 50s. 


Someone mentioned the ""classic"" red and white....my problem with that is some store in Oregon, possibly Ross?, had a ton of these in stock for nothing, and I see the identical one EVERYWHERE, generally on those who I, uh, wouldn't go to for fashion advice.   "
"Just got 3 shirts like that in the past few weeks. Had no idea these things were on the rise! 

Might as well post links to what I got:

anyone know where i can find some cheapish ones?
"Personal Request: I don't mind the aloha-style shirt, but does anyone know about men's floral-pattern shirts that are **not** in this style?

Something like [this](http://www.attorneysuess.com/images/category_4/Womens%20Floral%20Blouses%2034%20Sleeve%20Tunic%20Shirts%20Swing%20Tops%20Causal%20Flower%20Print%20-%20B0756X75R6_0.jpg), but designed and cut for guys."
"From Hawaii and work in an office where Aloha wear is a pretty common sight, mainly on Fridays. Believe it or not, the best one I've seen from a company recently that looks a lot like what I see people around the office and locals in Hawaii wear, but has a modern (not oversized) fit is from American Eagle.  

Just bought [this](https://www.ae.com/men-ae-reverse-print-poplin-button-down-blue/web/s-prod/2154_1287_400?cm=sUS-cUSD&catId=cat6000004) and [this](https://www.ae.com/men-ae-hawaiian-button-down-shirt-blue/web/s-prod/2154_1304_400?cm=sUS-cUSD&catId=cat6000004) and they look well in-line with Aloha Friday days at my office.  I also own a few Aloha shirts from surf brands also do modern fit, like Quiksilver, Hurley, and O'Neill.  

For a traditional take on it though, I agree with my fellow Hawaii poster - Reyn Spooner, Tori Richards, and Sig Zane are classic wears for parties, events, and Aloha attire here in the islands.  Sig Zane especially [is known to be the standard dress of local politicians.](http://www.honolulumagazine.com/Honolulu-Magazine/Politics/July-2014/Hawaii-Political-Fashion-Abercrombie-vs-Ige/).  Reyn Spooner and Tori Richards also does a modern, tailored fit as well.  The Kahala brand is also pretty popular."
Hawaiianshirtdude.com has some great stuff ... the magnum PI shirt for example 
"Check out Kennyflowers.co. Some of the sweetest Aloha shirts I‚Äôve ever seen, and they just came out with a new line. "
"So i didnt bother reading the article lol.  I'm just gonna go ahead and ignore the brands and prices, and zero in on the pattern and cut.  

Happily i can say i picked up about 4 or these this week. Infact, am wearing one right now."
"Floral/Hawaiian shirts are fine, but camp/cuban collars are out of style. You might be able to pull them off in a vacation spot but thats it."
Check out Manaola Hawaii for the latest in true Hawaiian prints. They use traditional patterns symbolizing our culture. Also earned a spot in NY Fashion week last year awesome designs sticking to the roots of Hawaiian culture
Not reyn spooner
I have trouble separating the good looking prints from the OK ones... but it‚Äôs easy to spot the bad looking ones
Not sure how well these would work for me. I have sleeves so I feel like the pattern would sorta clash for me. 
No thanks.
"Ummm, naaaah"
"this guy rocks them, that's good enough for me:

"a article about this without mention of Reyn Spooner, loooooool. "

Hilarious that you're getting downvoted. Self-deprecating humor is the best.

"They are only hard to pull off if you get a [bad pattern](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/7a/59/db/7a59db5ed35cbf5413f66877be15613e--aloha-shirt-hawaii-vintage.jpg) with [wierdo colors](https://sunbeachdressshop.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/h/a/hawaiian-aloha-shirt-beach-33_2.jpg).  They are actually super easy to pull off if you get a good one with lots of good colors.  I've had a few that I could literally wear with any color pants and look good.  The trick is to find patterns with [Navy](http://lghttp.55919.nexcesscdn.net/8036B42/magento/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/0/8/08513601.jpg) or [black](https://hawaiishirtcompany.com/wp-content/uploads/102c_275_black.jpg), Olive, [Cream](https://s2.sywcdn.net/getImage?url=https%3A%2F%2Fc.shld.net%2Frpx%2Fi%2Fs%2Fpi%2Fmp%2F32878%2Fprod_2343243232%3Fsrc%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.lljhawaii.com%252Fmedia%252Fhawaiihangover%252FSears%252FMenAlohaShirts%252F03510301.jpg%26d%3Dde7dea28d6add106aaaae05491825629de8d1b54&t=Product&w=1500&h=1500&qlt=100&mrg=1&str=1&s=e46452d2e4e003fbc9948a9848799751) and brown in them(all of those colors in 1 shirt) and they'll go with pretty much anything.

Other colors also work but it takes a little more finesse to pull them off sometimes.  The [classic red and white](https://sm.askmen.com/askmen_me/photo/default/elvis_nv7f.jpg) aloha shirt works well with jeans, and most vintage inspired aloha's will pair up nicely with jeans and a white tee except the really wild ones in super obnoxious colors.  Stick to [tonal color basics](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81V%2BiYemxJL._UX385_.jpg) and it's super easy

edit: [here is a small pinterest page for some ideas](https://www.pinterest.com/kearneynicholas/aloha-shirts/)"
"Depends on why you're wearing them. Going to the park and want to look like you can cook up great burgers, and can pull a coin from behind a child's ear? They're wonderful shirts for that kind of carefree attitude.

I was just in Hawaii and really wanted to get one. I couldn't find one that I thought I could pull off at home.  I saw a lot that I thought were cool but then I imagined myself wearing one around on the east coast and thought about how silly it would look.
If you carry extra weight on your upper body patterned shirts are just going to accentuate it.

"Same issue here, tried on 30 different shirts in the mens section of the thrift and none of them fit; went to the womens' sections and they fit like a glove, cropped in the body too for that sleek aesthetic, no shame, they're even cheaper too!"

Wow reyn Spooner has some great looking shirts. They are so expensive though

And can also be some of the most valuable finds to thrift if you know what you are doing.  A rare vintage aloha shirt can be worth over $1000, and its super common for them to be worth over $100 if they are legit from the 30s or 40s."

One of my favorite sweaters ever is like this; it looks like it's turned inside out in a really neat way. I've worn it for years, and probably will for a long long time. Anyone know where to find more stuff like this?"
"""The prints were done on the inside of the shirt""

Thats called reverse printing and its pretty common still...Check out Reyn Spooner for some reverse prints

Coconut son...still really common on better camp shirts.

""and the shirts only had 3 or 4 buttons""

The typical camp shirt has 5-7 buttons...teh top button being unused...which means 4 buttons are all you use on some of these shirts.  They still exist.

They do if you know where to look.  Reyn Spooner, Tori Richards, Kahala, Hilo Hattie, Kamehameha, Two Palms etc....look for legit Hawiian shirt brands, not the stuff in the basic mall stores.

*You're on a male fashion advice sub, is this an endorsement? "
Are you in middle school? Its 2018... being gay isn't an insult.
I don't think a button up shirt can be ethically made for much cheaper. Sweatshop slave labor and pollution can only subsidize your cheap clothing for so long until something gives out.
"I think the writer was saying thats extremely affordable for MiUSA clothing, which it is. 

But if you don't care about ethical production just hit up H&M, F21, ASOS, Zara etc."
It's not? What is?
I had a feeling that some of the non-recurring users wouldn't know who the author is lol 
FYI: Search eBay and/or Goodwill. I picked up some nice Reyn Spooner shirts for under $20 each and had them tailored to fit better. Most of them are quite boxy..

"Hey I'll be there too, for my wedding. I like to think of it as classic, instead of basic bitch. Same thing just sounds better. I bought some solid shirts at Ross that are almost identical to these in the article."
Not gonna lie I fuck with the shirt you linked for the bad pattern 
"As a guy who has 2 dozen of these kinds of shirts, and then looked at these pictures, I feel like it totally helps to be wicked handsome and/or have 2 full sleeves. I have neither of those characteristics in spades, but will agree that the right pattern AND color schemes makes a shirt fit with almost any pant. Once you start to stray into funky colors or abstract designs, it definitely makes finding the right fit more difficult. "
The bad one looks like an artist‚Äôs interpretation of an acid trip.
Got a link to that Navy shirt? 
He cream shirt is dope af. I wish all my shirts were cream colored 
"I have the EXACT Navy one you posted. It looks really good with the sleeves rolled up. The fabric on mine is not the common stuff cotton, it‚Äôs a synthetic blend that drapes really well.... I wore it to a wedding in hawaiii and I have worn it many times since. Thanks for building my confidence on choosing to wear it!"
"You make some good points, I guess its hard to pull off every day and where I'm from really fratty guys where ugly, Tommy Bahama hawaiian shirts which has kinda ruined the look for me. But I'm planning on getting one soon to try out"
I think its hard to pull off if youre the type that dresses workwear or grungey most the time since it doesnt fit that aesthetic. Much easier to pull off a non floral shirt. 
"It's the classic: ""blue, grey, brown. Choose two = fashionable"""

Literally my look for most of the summer. Hawaiian shirts tucked into black jeans with some loafers. Or the same thing swapped out for running shorts (no tuck) and Vans for casual errand running.
Honestly what I more associate them with is the guys that wear them with ray bans and sperrys and shotgun beers on a golf course lol
"Also pretty easy to take in the sides yourself, I discovered after buying some of those square shirts anyway."
"yeah but any fashion educated man will spot them womens shirts a mile away...they button up right over left...and probably also have boob darting.

"Reyn is right up there at the top quality level for Aloha Shirts...and they have a looooong history of making them.  IMO they are a little boring and ""old man"" TBH, but I cant argue with the quality at all."
Spooners are some of the best aloha shirts you can get and well known in Hawaii to be top shelf stuff.
"It feels so cool when you're wearing it on a hot, humid summer Hawaiian day"
"Their Hawaii shirts are made of viskose. Very  very soft and pleasant to touch and wear. So quality in my opinion is very high.

I am below average, so their XS fits very well. Keep in mind that Hawaii shirts are supposed to have some space, not skin tight. Aka, don‚Äôt look at SLP-look-wanna-be Alex costa.

How boxy we talking? I‚Äôm opposed to tailored Hawaiian shirts on principal 
Some people are into those oddball patterns and that's cool.... Doesn't mean you can't wear them....but it's definitely an odd ball pattern for an Aloha shirt and less easy to wear than something  more classic.
Everything about that yells woman repellant to me lol
"As a guy who has designed hundreds of aloha shirt patterns over the last 10 years and who is also well tatted up(and handsome:P)...I agree that tatts help a lot with pulling off the aloha shirt in an edgy way...and handsome helps with pretty much everything in life, I highly recommend it."
there are probably several places you can get it  [here is one](http://www.hawaiihangover.com/made-in-hawaii-men-s-hawaiian-shirt-aloha-all-over-floral-navy-pink.html)
Yeah I like that one too....I also have a bit of a soft spot for cream ground prints...I have a couple cream alohas.
"Probably a rayon blend....semi synthetic.  Drapes nicely and stays cool and comfy.

It's a pretty good pattern and I'm sure it matches most of your pant/short options."
Tommy Bahama kinda ruined opinions of the  aloha shirt for everyone by turning it into dadwear.
"Dude, I'm mr workwear and I rock aloha shirts like its my job (it sorta is my job).  I rock my selvedge denim with my Dr Martens and a rolled sleeve aloha all the time in summer...the ""rockabilly"" version of aloha basically....I actually [posted a pic lower down the comment chain with just such an outfit](https://imgur.com/wPzjsem). All you gotta do is sub out your flannel or chambray shirt with an appropriate aloha.  I have a whole bunch of these tropical shirts in a rack of different colors but they all work well with denim and workboots...you just gotta pick the right ones....you can also sub out the boots for deck shoes or sneakers if you think the boots are too much for the aloha shirt.

It really shouldnt be any trickier with grunge since most of the clothes are pretty similar to workwear...but you might opt for less bright patterns to stay grimey.


Now goth, thats an aesthetic where an aloha might be kinda hard to pull off."

"Hrmmm, usually when shirts are too baggy, I think my tailor just takes an even amount from the bottom of the shirt up to the armpit. Should I be requesting the fisheye dart instead?"
Do you refer to the responsibility to rock em like a total badass?
reverse printing is still very common in better mens brands.  Just google reverse print shirt to find options.....they arent just available in aloha styles.

Yeah, if you are actually a naturally fashionable guy this is almost something to strive for...like a personal challenge almost.

But for real, the alohas work great with denim....IMO it does look best with the sleeves rolled like a 50's greaser...and be careful about ""tent"" fits which is easy to run into with camp shirts....I actually prefer a shirt tail hem and a stand collar(like a short sleeve OCBD, but tropical print)"

It‚Äôs gonna rain and layering is key. Try to find a used stutterheim on grailed ;)
"Just a heads up: last winter we hit -20¬∞C to -30¬∞C on a number of days. Stockholm is obviously not as cold as some other parts of Sweden, but it can still get pretty cold. I would also recommend getting a base layer in some form of wool - especially for your legs. "
"You could get a navy or olive parka. I have an Abercrombie and Fitch one, alpha industries is also a good option."
I hope you're ready for that climate shift. Stockholm is cold and dark. I have a black bomber and a navy coat for when it's cold. And when it gets harsh I either throw on layers or a puffy thick jacket.
"One thing to note is that outside is freezing, but 99&#37; of indoor spaces are going to be super hot to combat that. So you go from freezing outside to sweating inside really quick. For this I would just say to layer for sure, so think a normal T, warm sweater, waterproof jacket, gloves and scarf. Those things can go off and on really easily. 

A couple of other quick tips, do no wear leather soled shoes as the rain will eat them alive and they will be wrecked in a week. Also from my experience most people your age do not wear Khakis or chino's its quite an Americanised thing that doesn't happen in Europe. All of the Swedish men I know from 18-25 tend to not wear a ton of bright colours at all, they mainly wear blue,grey and black.

I hope that helps!"
"While we‚Äôre discussing Stockholm, might I also ask what shoes/boots one should have for the winter? I‚Äôm going to be spending next semester there, which runs until the end of November."
"It does get colder than -15c kn stockholm, you're going to need a down jacket or a fur coat atleast.

Long johns are a MUST after October.

Get a good hat & gloves that can withstand the cold, your hands will need it.

Moisturizer for your face will be needed, as your skin gets very dry when it'd cold.

Flannels & wool sweaters are good tops, alongside hoodies. I wear sneakers year round but that's only possible with good socks and i would not recommend it over 30 minutes outside.

Duck boots are fine, generally you want something with a grip cause otherwise you'll be slipping. Desert boots wont work at all.

If you want a warm jacket that works both casually and formally I'd invest in a fur coat or an italian down jacket.


Regarding your budget for a jacket. Save your money, your best bet is prob a Fj√§llr√§ven Greenland Winter. Good outerwear is expensive but crucial. Remember that it's cheaper for a jacket in the states, but that only applies for american brands. Dont buy a fj√§llr√§ven in california, id look into the north face or canada goose."
"Yeah, even living in Ireland and England I've worn Long Johns (base layer leggings). Definitely get a pair if you're moving to Sweden!"
"You'll be fine with Sneakers till the end of november, its december-march that gets tough, but there'll prob not be a lot of ice during november.

Just get good socks"

I'm considering some N&Fs that are selling for cheap, and I'm worried of getting stinged too."
I think I‚Äôve seen you post about the HK denim of SF before - let‚Äôs see a pic of that Ervell blazer 
"A lot of the APC‚Äôs now have ‚Äústretch denim‚Äù, so you‚Äôre probably good. I think the NS run more slim, though. "

"What color jeans would go best?

Perhaps Navy chinos with cognac shoes? 

Or black jeans?

Perhaps one of these Navy pants:

"I've been having a lot of discussion about this and there's a lot of different opinions about this and many say that one can definitely wear jeans with dress shoes.
  
Just this morning, TheTieBar reposted my image
  
https://www.instagram.com/p/BlQdTXuAKhi/"
Yea it was surprising to me as well. 
"Got it from the Mr. Porter sale. I just happened to be browsing when they switched over to the final drop and it appeared right in front of me, in one size, my size. I never checked out my cart faster in my life. "
Usually its the thighs. I read that the NS were a roomier cut but without some sort of stretch I can't get in them. N&F Weird Guys are the best fit I have found so far. 
What size? I‚Äôm selling some black super skinny guys in 33 
"Ha I have! I am a huge fan. I could never get the Ervell faded denim to work on my body type 

I‚Äôm literally digging a fire pit in my back yard right now but it‚Äôs like this - except mine is the correct size. You can see that the shoulders are a little odd for an unstructured blazer....?

https://goo.gl/images/k23VHu 

https://goo.gl/images/9NXp2N

Notice on the 2nd photo how the shoulder seams kind of peak up? It‚Äôs odd. I‚Äôve never been able to press it out but I love the way it feels wearing it so much that I‚Äôve lived with it"
I wouldn't wear jeans with oxfords at all.  Oxfords are a more formal shoe whereas jeans are straight casual.  Bluchers would be the more appropriate shoe for jeans.  
"It's not about the color, it's about the style of shoe with the casual nature of the pants choice"
I don't know enough about APC to say anything about the fits but I wont buy unless they have detailed  measurements. 
"The ones I'm looking at are size 30 in slim, I'm 29 in most brands. 33 is probably too big for me."
"Cool! -Those Ervell pieces are treasures. (I search them out constantly.) I‚Äôm super tall, so the (Ervell) denim never worked for me, either. "
"Perhaps one of these?

https://www.thetiebar.com/pants?color=blue"
"Ha thanks I have the same blazer in emerald and it‚Äôs one of my favorites 

I have some pieces I will never ever get rid of because like you said they‚Äôre treasures. Peak Ervell FW seasons are IMO some of the greatest garments ever made!"
Absolutely.  Wool dress pants will almost always work with oxfords.
"Have you checked out /r/streetwear? They might be able to give you better advice, at least than I could, on there based on your examples.  Also this question would be prime for their simple questions thread so be sure to post it there."
Please god. Please let this be satire.
"here's a few inspiration albums from our sidebar that i thought would be a good starting point.

[athleisure](https://imgur.com/a/MvzdE)

[classic sportwear](https://imgur.com/a/FkGa6)

[bathing ape (streetwear)](https://imgur.com/a/GZoVF#0)

my suggestion is once you know the look you want, start saving pictures for your own personal inspiration album. 10-20 pictures is plenty so no need to go overboard. think about what you would wear in different kinds of weather. be sure to take note of the key pieces.

once you identify a major key piece, you should try to find a physical store and at least try it on before you commit to buying it.

final piece of advice from my own philosophy - plan your wardrobe. i mean get the ratios and number of shirts, jackets, and pants down ahead of time. too many people go into a store without a plan. that's how you ended up with track pants and crocs. don't be old you. have a plan."
"First off I would recommend reading the [colour guide](https://redd.it/15tjgv) and [creating an outfit that works guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/19qc8c/a_rudimentary_guide_on_creating_outfits_that_work/).

They're a bit long and wordy so take your time. 

As others have said have look at /r/streetwear for some recommendations or inspiration. Some of the stuff either in /r/streetwear and even /r/malefashionadvice might not jive with you, but if you can lurk for a bit and try to gain some inspiration in what people are wearing, inspiration albums and make use of either's extensive wikis.

Specifically on your sneakers:

All of them listed there are very bright and saturated colours. So I would pair them with relatively neutral clothes to let the footwear 'pop'. So greys, black, tans and navy would be good. If you opt for patterned garments then usually smaller patterns are the easiest to wear and match with other garments and accessories. 

If you find jeans restrictive then I would consider stretch joggers or trousers/pants like Uniqlo's EZ (easy pants) or maybe their cropped ankle pants if you're comfortable and want to let your sneakers really pop.
"
"Definitely never wear a graphic tee with the spider Man vans, one or the other can be fine but going for both will undoubtedly make you look like an 8 year old. I would also suggest you to try to get used to wear real trousers rather than trackpants all the time. It doesn't have to be jeans, try some chinos or something and make yourself wear them a couple of times a week. It is really not that uncomfortable and regressing into only wearing the most comfortable things to the point of track pants and Crocs is not good for you or your look."
How old are you? 
"Crocs and Lebron Sprites? These are polar opposites. I understand the Sprites but can you explain how you can enjoy something as flashy as those and wear crocs?

This comment is not intended to be facetious and I‚Äôm genuinely trying to understand the process in order to help. "
"I‚Äôll check it out, thanks. "
"Sorry if I someone offended you, but no it‚Äôs not. I‚Äôll delete my post if others feel the same I guess. "
"I‚Äôve seen those and I feel like none of them really represent me. I‚Äôm not someone that can pull sporty off for sure, and streetwear has always felt super foreign to me. 

It really is a struggle for me to stay comfortable both physically and mentally without looking disgusting I guess. "
"Thanks so much for being helpful (and not rude....) I‚Äôll check it out I think the bottom half of my outfit will stay the same, it‚Äôs just the upper half I need to figure out. I‚Äôm really not wanting to give up the sense of individuality and uniqueness that I get from wearing a shirt I love. I‚Äôll try to keep the shirts in line color wise if I do stick with them. "
"Just tried on a Fallout 76 shirt with the shoes. The shirt is mainly just blue but says fallout 76 in small text on the top right corner and has a 76 on the back, other than that it‚Äôs a plain blue shirt. It looked alright with track pants and vans. "
18
"Blue and green are my favorite colors, so I saw them and immediately loved them. "
I‚Äôm sorry - i thought this had to be satire because of the crocs. I‚Äôm gonna keep it real with you chief. Don‚Äôt wear track pants and crocs. Wear some jeans that fit and then you‚Äôll be good. Track pants cannot be done well unless you are currently on a track.
"Keep it super simple. Your shoes are pretty loud, just go with simple stuff.

If you want to keep wearing track pants, try a jogger style which has a tapered leg below the knee and a cuff, which will show off your shoes. There are plenty of examples in the athleisure album above. 

No need to go crazy on top - your shoes are already a focal point. Just go with plain colored tees that fit decently. When all else fails, go all black on top and bottom with your shoes being the pop of color. "
"All the shoes you bought are streetwear, and you talk about preferring to wear looser fits, so maybe this is exactly what represents you.
Alternatively, maybe you started off with shoes that don't represent you, because those are sporty streetwear. 

Just curious, what does represent you? What are some things you want to communicate about yourself? What are things you currently communicate about yourself? That's what the inspiration albums and planning are for.

And one other thing, I don't get where this whole thing about clothes being uncomfortable comes from? I'm wearing suede bucks, a pair of chinos and an OCBD. To be frank, my outfit feels just about as good as wearing joggers or jeans and a t-shirt since all I'm doing is sitting down at a computer."
">Thanks so much for being helpful (and not rude....)

The reason some of us are a little harsher in how we try to give advice, is because we see this kind of stuff daily. A lot of us know when something just plain and simply won't look good, but then the OP says ""nah I don't like that advice, I won't change anything I'm doing""

People here seem to just think anyone asking for advice is going to do the worst, when most don't."
"No problem! 

I think you'll find that as a community, this subreddit, usually takes one major way when helping people out.

That is we recommend the 'MFA uniform/Basic Bastard' (BB) and teach things like how to put together an outfit/colours/etc. Then after that we direct people to 'developing personal style'. So in a way we both give you a fish and teach you how to fish at the same time.

Now this works for the majority of people (or the people who use reddit) but it's not going to work for everyone. For some people they don't want to use the 'uniform or BB' or have their own sense of personal style skipping to learning to fish would be the best way forward.

One way of learning is looking at other styles or subreddit communities or websites to gain an appreciation of colours, fits, silhouette, etc. That why people have recommended /r/streetwear also, because your footwear choice aligns with their styles a lot more than MFA, that's not to say we can't be of help either though! "
"I recommend that you get some solid color Ts from a good basics brand. I don't know where you live so I don't know exactly which brands will have stores, but I'm assuming US. Uniqlo, Gap, etc. all have good T-shirts for decent prices so maybe try using some good colors to incorporate into your outfits. If you're dead-set on using those sneakers, then make them the focus of the outfit. Don't have a loud graphic tee and loud sneakers. Some good colors to get you started are black, greys, blues, lighter pinks, etc. "
Fair enough reason. Are you trying to change your style or only find an outfit or two which works with these shoes?
"I‚Äôve seen track pants pulled off, crocs not so much. "
"Is there ever a case where a graphic tee works? I basically own only graphic tees right now. Star Wars, Zelda, Led Zeppelin, etc. "
"I‚Äôll start with the last question, I‚Äôve got super sensitive skin for sone reason. That mainly manifests itself in shirts that I wear. I can wear a button up, but something with just a collar is really really bad for me. I‚Äôve got one spot on my upper chest, right where the that collar would be, that is ridiculously sensitive for whatever reason. 

As far as pants go I love how easy track pants are. Any jeans I‚Äôve ever owned slip off as I walk, but go one size down and they don‚Äôt fit me. I also feel restricted in movement, but that‚Äôs not as much of a problem I guess. I also just like the soft material of track pants better. Suit pants  are totally fine with me.

As far as what represents me, a lot of things do. I love Star Wars, video games, super heroes, classic rock, etc. Thats why my most common graphic tees are a blackish gray Star Wars shirt, a green Zelda shirt, or my new Led Zeppelin shirt. They‚Äôre all pretty comfortable material wise and the last 2 shirts are somewhat colorful.  I‚Äôm a bit of a geek, but not in a glasses and high pants sort of way. 

I think I was turned off by streetwear because the images seemed really crazy. Jackets with words all over them, weird shirts, crazy pants. Maybe I was just looking at the wrong side of it. "
I‚Äôm absolutely taking the advice. Gonna share a photo of what I‚Äôm wearing now in a sec. Just wanna blot our my face because I need to shave. 
"I‚Äôve got a good outfit that I think works. Here‚Äôs an alright photo with my face blotted out. You can‚Äôt see the shirt color very well. https://i.imgur.com/eJ971Bd.jpg Apologies for the mess, it‚Äôs the only room with a full body mirror that I could find. "
"I‚Äôd agree mostly, but that‚Äôs kind of an unfair mischaracterization. I‚Äôm just a little terse when people come here asking for validation. It may be uncomfortable, but honest good advice is better than comforting advice that won‚Äôt actually give the desired long-term outcome."
"Cool! I‚Äôm gonna post over there too then, just in case. I‚Äôm definitely the type to do their own thing, but I think I‚Äôll find a good way to make it work soon enough. I‚Äôm kinda sick of hearing moans and groans from my family when we go out haha. "
Trying to find something to go with my 3 new shoes. 
"Track pants are best worn with sneakers for a more casual 'streetwear' style.

But yeah, I wouldn't go around wearing crocs casually. Keep them as a 'house slipper' or something you do housework in."
"Yeah. You can pull them off. If you're athletic-looking and you wear athletic clothes, it looks like you work out. If you're 
> overweight (but absolutely not fat)

then you look like a slob. I really hate to have to be the one to say this, but the shoes you got are really not very nice-looking and it's going to be difficult to, as you say, ""improve your look"" without compromising your ""nerdiness"" and the comfort of your track pants. 

E: OP, can you give us a fit pic to show us what you're working with? It would really help to have an idea of what the outfits your're describing look like.

E2: I just wanted to clarify that this comes from a place of love. I was once in your situation. I had a similar dilemma and instead of looking for validation I listened to the people telling me I looked like a homeless person. Coming from someone who had your same issues, I suggest you do the same."
"They probably weren‚Äôt pulled off by an ‚Äòoverweight Jewish kid with a jewfro‚Äô, though.

Jeans and sneakers sound like a good look for you. Please burn the crocs."
"I guess it would depend on the tee. You'd want to at least co-ordinate the top with the shoe color. Once again fit is key. If you look at a lot of streetwear stuff much of it could be considered ""graphic"" in nature. 

You seem pretty set on hanging onto the graphic tees and I don't think you should get rid of them if you feel that they are part of your identity. You should never change who you are just to look like what you think other people think you should look like. But just accept that some people may look at them and associate them with things such as youth or immaturity. "
"OK, I understand what you're talking about. Yeah it's not just patterns and colors, it's also the fits, items and profiles. Feel free to pick a plain, or solid colored item. doesn't have to be loud to be streetwear, that's just how some people peacock."
"I think that some slightly tapered joggers like other people have said would be good. The show of the shoes a little more and don't look super baggy.

The tshirts don't look horrible (atleast this one doesn't) and the only advice for that is to try and lose a little weight. Just eat a little less or try and cut out things like breads and potatoes (since they are mostly just filler). It may sound like advice that you've heard so many times, but it's the best advice. You need to look good to look good.

Get some better fitting tapered joggers, and you will look a little more put together."
"I agree. People should come here to be helped. If they want validation they should post in the WAYWT threads, not the outfit check threads.

That was also one of the differences in a recent cross post from /r/femalefashionadvice. The commentors over there were more accepting of how people dressed, but over here we say this is how it should be."
"The vans were meant to take place of the crocs once I really break them in. I‚Äôm not quite sure how to wear them right though. Most of the time I see people wearing vans they‚Äôre the skater type and that really isn‚Äôt me. 

Track pants and sneakers I can do, I always thought that wouldn‚Äôt look bad but it‚Äôs nice to know it can actually be a thing. I just need to figure out a good balance between shirts I feel comfortable with emotionally and physically (I have weird sensitive skin). "
Could you explain exactly what a fit pic is?
"I‚Äôve never really understood the fit of shirts, but I guess that‚Äôs because if I wear tight shirts my larger stomach shows and I look ridiculous. The other day I went to John Varvatos (it‚Äôs what I wear when I‚Äôm not wearing my weird clothing, and it‚Äôs pretty great) and got a purple cashmere sweater that I was told looked good on me. It was a tad tight though and I felt like I wasn‚Äôt confident enough to wear it, so I haven‚Äôt. "
"I‚Äôve got a good outfit that I think works. Here‚Äôs an alright photo with my face blotted out. You can‚Äôt see the shirt color very well. https://i.imgur.com/eJ971Bd.jpg Apologies for the mess, it‚Äôs the only room with a full body mirror that I could find. "
"I‚Äôve been on a diet for a little while that‚Äôs been working. Lost 11 pounds so far. Just been stuck at this lower weight for a bit though. Oh, and this isn‚Äôt a normal tee shirt for me.  It‚Äôs from John Varvatos. I made an effort to look nicer. "
"My issue is just with guys like this one. 

>how do i look better but i don‚Äôt want to do any of the things that make me look better

Nobody‚Äôs just willing to take one for the team and be totally honest, which is what this guy needs. Someone needed to tell him to forget everything he thought about clothes/fashion and start over from the top. He mentioned something about how his T-shirt was a John Varvatos shirt, noting that he ‚Äúmade an effort to look nicer‚Äù when in fact the shirt fit pretty horribly and the whole outfit looked like dogshit. They were telling him to look at r/streetwear and look at the athleisure style. IMO athleisure works when you have the athl-part down (i.e. it makes sense that you‚Äôre wearing gym clothes), but it it doesn‚Äôt, it just looks bummy. The denial is real with this guy and someone had to be truthful with him. It‚Äôs either looking put together OR track pants. Not both. Someone had to do it, and I‚Äôm happy to take downvotes for it."
"Sk8trs aren't the only ones who can wear vans. They aren't some mystical brand that only people who can do ollies and kick flips are allowed to wear.

Just wear them. No one is going to judge you for wearing one of the biggest shoe brands, but people will judge you for wearing crocs."
"take a picture of you wearing an outfit (""fit"") that you describe here so we can get an idea of your clothes, the fit of the clothes, body type, etc."
"[This is a fit pic (of me)](https://imgur.com/a/Yz4udiC)

We can't help very well if all you say is ""Black crocs, black trackpants, and a graphic tee of some kind. "" and ""Sometime of note, I'm an overweight (but absolutely not fat) white kid with a Jew Fro.""

Would you be able to help me if I said ""mint untucked button down, grayish tshirt, blue chinos, brown belt, and tan vans, also I'm kinda tall but not too tall white kid with curly hair""

Because I definitely couldn't. Just take a couple of decent pictures of yourself and post them. We want to help you look better, and actually seeing the outfit makes it SOOOO much easier."
"I tend to find blue and black to be too close for comfort unless you're dealing with a really light blue (think 90s denim). Getting a bit more contrast can be helpful. Alternatively, stay dark but within the same color family - so greys with black, or blues with navy.

Disclaimer for this next part: I have different fit issues than you, so I'm talking only out of what I've heard (and I might be full of shit). Loose shirts can counter-intuitively show off more of the parts of your body that you're trying to de-emphasize. In this picture, for example, there's a bit of a drape off your upper chest that accentuates the curves there. Sometimes getting a shirt that follows the body closer can do less to draw the eye to those parts. Again, though, no personal experience - I've just seen some before/after pics and been amazed at the difference (but I don't know the specifics of how they got there).

Having some heavier fabric helps with the drape, too, although that's often too warm and not quite with the style you're rockin'.

I'm really fascinated by the sensitive skin and pants issues, I hope someone can help with those!"
I'd go check out some fitness subreddits or weight loss subreddits. They could help you more than us.
Gonna be straight with you my man. Doesn‚Äôt matter where the t shirt comes from. They mostly look the same in terms of color and fit unless you have a specific body type and the T is made to fit well/flatter. I‚Äôd suggest also that you wait to get any nice new clothes until you get to your goal weight so you don‚Äôt keep rebuying. Best of luck!
Oh judgement wasn‚Äôt something I was worried about. Just pulling them off. 
"Alright, seems easy enough. I‚Äôll do that when I get home. "
Thanks so much for the suggestions! I‚Äôm learning a lot. 
"Still, crocs aren't the prettiest or most comfortable shoe. I'd try to wear vans or your sneakers."
"> Oh judgement wasn‚Äôt something I was worried about. Just pulling them off.

How do you determine if you're ""pulling them off""? Via judgement, either external or self-focused. If you truly don't care what anyone else thinks then it doesn't matter what you wear. But it's good to care a bit - it shouldn't be how you judge your self worth, but it's important to recognize that clothing (in any form) affects how people see you (both good and bad). So be honest with yourself about that."
"While I get that she is just striving to maintain an authentic feel for the brand, Sarah really needs to step out of Alexander's shadow and progress beyond an echo of his style."
"As the SS19 fashion week has ended I figured I would start to share some of my favorite shows from the season, starting of with McQueen and their gorgeous outerwear. 

McQueen are someone I always expect to have a good runway and this season is no exception. What I loved about this collection were the amazing suits they presented, the cuts are gorgeous and the styling was very unique and varied, ranging from streetwear to business casual to stuff you'd only expect to find at the MET Gala. 

My favorite pieces were

For real the glasses are pretty cool
"I bought a dashiki because I saw Kanye wear one and thought it looked good. I didn't realize there were so many bigots who had a problem with a white person doing that. I never realized how many people think of personal fashion in such a racist way. Fashion for me is about individualism and it should hold no bounds, otherwise its another example of mental slavery.

"Well it‚Äôs definitely subjective on whether or not you think his fashion looks good, but objectively he is one of the most influential people in fashion of our times so I‚Äôd say that means he does have a good taste"
But so is literally everything else on this sub
Dont let morons ruin your individuality
The Time cover was just confirmation
"Yeah maybe he's influential but that doesn't equate to taste, necessarily. I'm not making a comment on if he's good or bad, but cargo shorts have had a pretty big influence on a large scale and it'd be a tough sell to say they're tasteful.

Pretty sure a huge majority of his Yeezy fashion line is a flop correct? His shoes are big in the hypebeast market but that's about it as far as I know. 
Yes
üåäüåäüåä
"All I‚Äôm trying to say is look at the trends and look at his influence on them, he is a huge trendsetter and to be a trendsetter you have to have a good taste. I totally understand thinking a lot of his clothes are ugly but when high end fashion brands take inspiration from him you have to give him credit. Balenciaga and Gucci both took influence from the Yeezys for their chunky shoes they recently released, and while they may not be appealing to you saying those brands don‚Äôt have taste is ridiculous "
"stuff you design not doing well =! having bad taste

it‚Äôs a comparison between discrete fields; would be like saying an influential music critic knows nothing because they can‚Äôt play classical violin. "
"You realize the whole dad shoe trend being popular is literally bc of him right? Love it or hate it but when it comes to a majority of streetwear and designer trends he is one of the biggest trendsetters. Understandably, I can see why the r/mfa community seems pretty divided on him but in the grand scheme of things he is as important in fashion as he in is music. He‚Äôs an influencer in pretty much any field he contributes to."
"I think it's the higher end stuff that's not doing very well, just because it's designer priced. His more accessible Adidas stuff like the Calabasas line sold out quickly."
"Hey man, I'm not making a statement about whether anyone has good taste or doesn't. Again, all I'm saying is that taste is subjective. The fact that he has influence is a fact, yes. They aren't the same thing. Not sure how me saying Balenciaga or Gucci have bad taste even became a thing in your last sentence. "
"If something objectively ugly exists, Kanye could wear it and there would be dudes in r/streetwear asking wtc. Good taste may have gotten him to this point, but he‚Äôs too big for any of that to matter now. Kanye is such a massive part of the culture that whatever he says or does becomes the culture. Whether he has good taste or not is irrelevant, and it certainly isn‚Äôt a prerequisite for being a trendsetter. "
Raf Simons is the name you are looking at for god sake! Even lanvin come out with dad shoes before yeezy. Yeezy wish it could be balenciaga. Do not lump them together please.
[deleted]
"Nope Raf Simons was the one whom make it popular. Kanye and Virgil just copied design from Dior Homme(Hedi) , APC and to some extend Undercover. 
"
"But it's no more ""designer-priced"" than other brands, some of which sell very well indeed. It feels like the higher end Yeezy items are aimed a certain market, yet doesn't live up to their expectations for the price; both in terms of design or build quality."
"Hmm you‚Äôre not wrong, I think I did get carried away a bit haha, my bad"
"Raf is dope but seriously, ask most dudes heavy into streetwear on where they got their inspo and a lot will say Kanye before Raf. Think this way, Shawn Kemp wasn't the first to dunk but he sure as hell made it look good."
"Why are you being downvoted?! RAF is 100% the source of the ugly sneaker train. Seems like everyone hated rafdidas when they came out, and years later everyone is copying them.

"Not necessarily defending Ye or discrediting other designers but hate it or love it Kanye is easily one of the most influential, if not the most when it comes to the fashion world. Everything from his Yeezus era look (backed by Fear of God and art by Wes Lang) to his Pablo merch was constantly imitated. The all white ultraboosts sold in minutes after Kanye wore them at the 2015 BBMAs and started re-selling in the thousands for a while. Every garment that dude wears goes for gold the next day. I'm not going to change your mind on Ye or his fashion but to say that Kanye didn't popularize a lot of streetwear's biggest trends is kinda ignorant."

Suit 2: Charcoal / dark gray


Suit 3: Your choice ‚Äî medium blue, medium gray, light gray, brown"
"I can imagine Black, Blue, and Brown as three main colours.

Styles? Depends on your body type. Skinny, Slim, or Regular suits.

If you're not on a budget, you can go Next to buy some suits. Buying three will easily cost you ¬£300+. If you're looking for bang for buck, try Matalan."
"charcoal, navy blue, light grey"
"You could try some lighter-weight chinos or some linen/linen blend pants. Helps to go with a slightly looser fit. Bare ankles and cuffed pants helps a little more, too. "
"I live in DC, where it's hot as balls, but I personally don't wear a lot of shorts. As was previously mentioned, light-weight fabrics, including linen and linen blends are great. My thing is loose fitting pants, I feel that's the biggest factor. I wear wider pants just so that my legs have room inside, not to mention it's quite comfortable. Uniqlo has some pretty good light-weight pants that would fit looser, if your a slimmer guy especially. Dickies are also good. "
Do you have a budget?
"No budget? Burberry.  Small budget? No idea.  Try your local big retailer, they'll have something close..."
This is a chesterfield coat. Top layer for the winter months. 
"The two most commonly suggested starter suits are plain navy blue and charcoal. Light gray, tweed, or a subtle windowpane are more adventurous without being overboard. I don't feel that pinstripes are in style, especially a high contrast color scheme. they remind me of old comic book private eyes or Hollywood gangster movies which is costumey rather than professional or cool."
"I actually think the contrast of tanned/darker skinned people look great in white/yellow/pink etc.  I would rock white all day long.  It looks WAY worse when it's a snow white ginger wearing white/pink/yellow IMO, no offense to anyone who fits that description.  I'm Italian so I have darker skin, though likely not nearly as dark as most Hispanic people, I really love White. "
I personally don't think that white clashes with darker skin tones. I think that it serves as a cool bit of natural contrast if you work it into your outfit. 
I have the same issue as well (Mexican as well) because I love dark colors but lately I was complemented on a light blue shirt I had on! I guess the contrast looks nice. 
I‚Äôm aboriginal and I stay away from white clothing as much as possible 
" The advice I've always read ([e.g.](http://www.fashionbeans.com/article/right-colours-wear-skin-tone/)) is that one should avoid colours that are very close to one's skin tone, but contrasting colours are fine."

"You have taken a good decision to get inspired from CMBYN for your trip to Italy. You don't need to be Armie Hammer to pull off the outfits. Obviously a good physique will help. Just like him, a regular cotton Polo Ralph Lauren button down is your best bet. Remember that slimmer will eventually translate to sweatier. You need to give you body the opportunity to breathe a little. Let the Italian coast wind blow throw you a little. It's summer after all, go a little wild. *Dress for the summer you want, not for the one you have* is one of the best pieces of advice I've been given recently.

"Seems like a very trendy fit. Slim pants all through the waist and thighs, shorter jacket, very tapered waist, thin lapel. Don't really see anything wrong with it unless you wanted a more classic suit."
The waist supression is extreme but that could be a taste thing I guess. Way too short though. 
"GAP chinos are a good bet, especially if you catch them during one of their frequent 40% off sales."
ASOS Design Slim/Skinny/Super Skinny Chinos are really great and really cheap. Look out for the multipacks for extra savings. They fit great and have a wide range of sizes.
"Uniqlo. Best brand for basic clothing, got a great selection of color and all, and their trousers are terrific. "
To be honest you probably aren‚Äôt.  Linen has absolutely 0 give and they will just rip lol
I have linen pants from Cubavera that aren't too baggy.
"If you're confident it will fit okay, sure. The $700 ""MSRP"" is of course a joke, but $200 is generally a decent price for a cheap (but wool) suit."
I have New Balance 574 and Adidas Pureboost. Both are comfortable throughout the day. 
Brooks Ghosts and Adrenaline GTS both come in wide and are comfy as fuck. I‚Äôm on my feet a lot and dress more athleisure as I‚Äôm a student/grad assistant and I think it looks the best without giving off a ‚ÄúI‚Äôm actually out of my element‚Äù vibe.

"I'd look over the style guides in the sidebar, like the ""Basic Bastard"" ones, but since you're entering high school, focus more on the casual side of what's recommended there.

My quick-and-dirty advice, without knowing the specifics about you or where you live? Get:

- some fashionable sneakers in a basic color scheme: Stan Smith, Vans, Converse, etc

- Some basic (no weird details or distressing) jeans in a dark wash that fit you well. (not super tight, not super baggy, some taper to the leg) (for cooler weather)

- Some chino shorts that hit just above the knee. (for hot weather) Just go for tan, navy, olive, gray, etc.

- Some heathered gray tees that fit well. You can wear these with pretty much anything but gray pants.

- For fall: a plaid flannel shirt or two in a safe color scheme, a sweatshirt (hoodie or pullover) in some basic color (olive, gray, navy, etc)"
"Start with the basics. When building your wardrobe, first and main priority is to have your basics down. White and black tees, black pants, basic shoes. My advice: get some vans old skools or converse to start on foot, go to Uniqlo and get some basic trousers, chinos, or jeans, I'd say in black (or blue for jeans if you want). Make sure they fit, i.e. not too long that the crumple on your foot, and not too wide or skinny, just go with a classic straight fit. Also at Uniqlo, get some basic white tee shirts, maybe some black. That's like the most, most, basic things you need, once you have that sorted, you can start working in some colors. Almost any color of tee shirt goes with black pants, so black pants are honestly the best thing you can have, especially in high school. Stay away from graphics and all that to start, oftentimes they can be tacky or ugly. Hoodies and crewneck sweaters are your go to for colder climates, Champion make good quality ones, but you can obviously find them most anywhere, like Uniqlo or H&M (see how I keep bringing up Uniqlo lol? Best brand for basics...). Once you've built up your basics, gotten a few pairs of trousers, maybe some jeans (black or mid-blue I'd suggest, and non of that stupid acid wash or anything crazy; think Uniqlo or Levis), you can also go for some navy or blue trousers I'd suggest. 

So for basics, here's what I'd suggest. 

Uniqlo - You can find everything I just mentioned at Uniqlo, and for very good prices as well, and great quality. I can't stop ragging on about Uniqlo, it's honestly such a great place for basics. 

\-Remember, slim or regular cut pants/jeans. 

\-Tee shirts should fit; not skin tight and not super oversized. Go true to size. I'm 5'8.5 approximately, and I wear large, and get a slightly oversized look, which is good imo. Just for your reference. 

\-I'd honestly stay away from sweatpants, but if you want some, again, Uniqlo. 

\-I prefer pullover hoodies as opposed to zip up hoodies, I think it just gives a cleaner look. Zip up hoodies often start to fall loosely, especially when open, and it just looks sloppy imo. However, feel free to disagree. 

Shoes:

I mentioned vans and Converse. Those are classics, and you can't go wrong, especially if you get basic or classic colors. Black, white, maybe cream, and you're set. Once you've got that down, Adidas or Nike's are great. I tend to prefer Adidas for casual vibes, the Gazelles, Campus, or Stan Smiths are great, and come in a variety of colors. Nike also has the Cortez, the Air Force, and the Air Max models, which are also good. A couple things to remember though: If you're getting Air Max', stick to the Air Max 1, Air Max 90, or maybe Air Max 97. Can't go wrong with those. And also, the Air Force 1 is a great shoe, the white is definitely better than the black lol (again, opinion), but they are a bulkier shoe, so definitely no skinny jeans with those. Nothing tighter than slim, and I'd suggest regular cut trousers. Lastly, there are of course Puma sneakers which are good. Obviously there are so many more as well, I wouldn't say buy them yet, but if you look up the Common Projects Achilles Low in white, that's a really good style of shoe, and you can find that style for much cheaper price points, especially if you're just figuring out your style. 

And finally, Outerwear. 

Uniqlo. That's all I have to say. 

Once you get this, and you've gotten the whole hang of things is when you should start to branch out a bit more. Things like graphic tees can be nice, obviously H&M has a bunch, or you can look around Urban Outfitters. Color is a great thing to play with, but to really understand what colors work and what don't, you have to stand in front of a mirror and try things on endlessly, or just have some balls and wear it in public and see what works lol. 

But this is my basic high school guide, you should be fine for most regular occasions with this. Feel free to ask me more, about high school dressing or if you want to go beyond this and look towards some different styles, like more preppy styles, or whatnot. Good luck, and most of all, remember that it doesn't matter how you look if you don't feel good in the clothes you're wearing. Always wear what makes you feel good. "
"Check out the sidebar, specifically [Step-by-Step Intro](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/1laa42/a_stepbystep_guide_to_starting_to_dress_well_for/?st=jjhadtxz&sh=ce7ce836), [Building a Basic Wardrobe](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/5da1xt/building_a_basic_wardrobe_v60/?st=jjhadu8v&sh=80199299), and [Creating Outfits that Work](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/19qc8c/a_rudimentary_guide_on_creating_outfits_that_work/?st=jjhaduvk&sh=83089f53).


Also, and I know this isn't super helpful, but ‚Äî try not to sweat it too much. People wear all kinds of stuff in high school, some of it good, lots of it pretty bad. While teenagers can treat each other pretty poorly, I doubt you'll be getting into a situation where you're being talked about / made fun of for your clothes unless they're really really weird."
"Sun hats as a whole might be the wrong idea if you're worried about making it a part of one cohesive look. You're probably better off with a nice looking plain colored or minimally designed baseball hat. It'll offer a little less sun protection if that's what you're worried about but that's nothing a touch of SPF 50 on the back of your neck won't fix. 

Alternatively you can just wear it constantly, throw in some cargo pants, and force a look known as [""Every single biology professor I've ever had""](https://imgur.com/a/ROoHa8p) into style."
"That sounds fine (if the colors work together and the fits are ok) but if it's really hot and you're sweating up a storm then that's not too good, so..."
"jeans and a button down are fine! but if you think it's going to be too hot, i don't think it's wrong to wear shorts. especially if it's a day date. "
"They're OK, but I'd opt for something squishier. My New Balance and Adidas Iniki runners are super cush. "
"No.  You can coordinate, but don't match.  Just don't wear anything that outright clashes or outright matches and you'll be fine. "
"You can be complementing each other - similar tones etc (i.e. if she wears a purple dress, you in navy suit with maybe a purple tie or pocket square, not necessarily same colour). But matching is very try-hard. "
"Yeah, with a shirt, black denim and boots would look great. Check out Barbour/Belstaff style for aesthetic - they do a lot of those"

All linen everything bro try muji 
J. Crew and Brooks Brothers make fantastic linen and cotton short sleeve button downs that would go great with that untucked or tucked depending on the shirt/occasion. I'd be more worried about your shoe/belt combo.  A Polo Shirt would be great too I think.  They don't look too dressy.  
"Here are some outfits i've worn with my linen pants. I would suggest go for looser tops to fit the style, and keep you cooler.

"Personally, to avoid the *foreign-professor-on-vacation-in-Europe* look, I'd keep the linen material to only my pants. For your vacation, as tops, I would get one white crew neck t-shirt, one navy towelling fabric polo shirt, one light blue cotton shirt and one soft sweater for the evenings to put on top. For shoes, as there would be a lot of walking, get a pair of nice sneakers - depends on your style really but a pair of cream converse all stars or Diadora Heritage ones will go with pretty much anything. Also get a pair of brown tassle or horsebit loafers from leather or suede."
How are the fit on those pants? I‚Äôd like to pick up a pair
I (as someone who is into sneakers in general) think that chalk white shoes work well with most colors. I can't personally think of anything right now that it would look bad with. Was the heel counter accent black or navy? 
"A leather trainer/sneaker like that in white really does go with just about everything and most occasions below business casual.  I think outfits that really rock are tan or gray chino shorts/pants and an appropriate shirt in black, white, or any other pop of color really. Being white, they're neutral and a good base.  Wear them all year round!"
"As Doc said, there's not much it won't go with. I would offer the advice that size is the most important thing in fashion, before color. So if the pants fit you properly, these sneakers will go with virtually anything. Also, try to keep it simple while you're getting started (and Stan Smiths are the perfect simple shoe so you're off to a good start). I see a lot of people here looking to fix everything overnight, or have the perfect closet right away and it's simply not feasible! "
tan and black go together much better than brown and black. Shouldn't be an issue
Brown and black together is touchy though both specific outfits you mentioned are alright. Or you can get a grey/charcoal t-shirt and brown shoes and make the headache go away. 
The usual suspects: white and very light blue. 
"it may be easier for taller people to pull the look off, but you shouldn't have an issue with it. "
"Vermont Flannel, Woolrich, LL Bean, and Pendleton are solid quality and stock flannels year round"
do you have any examples of what normal people wear that you are trying to avoid?
check out the basic bastard wardrobe
"Growing up in the Midwest, and going to high school in suburbia, the guys tended to dress preppy like they were all going to join frats when they joined college. It was all PRL, Sperrys, chino shorts. Not sure what the fashion at your high school is, but you can always try to fit in and do what everyone else is doing, or just try to look nicer in general with some clothes that just fit better and are more ‚Äúin style.‚Äù Don‚Äôt try to dress too old, but definitely try the basic bastard or MFA uniform to start and see where that gets you. Hopefully that helped! I wish you luck on your fashion journey young one!"
"So would an outfit like this be okay?
https://i.imgur.com/joaiUrf.jpg

Just trying to gauge which styles would work at your high school."
Made in the UK 991s.
"I've never been disappointed with anything Uniqlo yet, I say go for it, too"
"i dont know if i like how the collar and the hood look togther, but go for it, if you dont mind"
I like the look of it.
"Goodwill, Thrift shops, eBay, or something unique from Gitman Brothers Vintage."
"Desert boots are still a solid option, but if you have one pair in sand suede already, I think you should try some other options. But that is up to you. if you do like them, there is nothing wrong having a second pair.

Black derbies are nice if you dress mostly in black, grey and white. White sneakers go with any color so they are really versatile. 

What kind of trousers you planning on wearing your new shoes?

If mostly with blue jeans or khakis then go with CDB. If with black/grey trousers or jeans, then black derbies. If all of those, then maybe white sneakers. That is just my opinion though and some may think differently."
One ear is still fine. Up to you. Do you want to wear them in both ears? 
"At that price point, there are no other good alternatives. Just buy more of those, or invest in something better."
It looks like some sort of mini messenger bag for ipads or small laptops. Avoid.
"> Would be appropriate not to wear a tie?

Depends on the formality level of the wedding. If everyone else is wearing ties and jackets... you'd need one. Luckily you can find ties at most department stores. 

Alternatively, if you're rocking a summer sport coat, wear a nice Oxford shirt and go tieless if the wedding attire calls for it."
"That's kinda where the fit is right now for Japanese fashion. You could check out Needles or Beams+ since they usually have some slimmer stuff. For the most part though, as long as it's comfortable and you like it you should wear it. That's the epitome of Japanese fashion IMO, wearing what you like and being comfortable in it"
"You would be right for not wanting to break the bank. I'm one for quality and such, but keep in mind that it's going to be hard wearing for your kit - sweating, stretching, pushing and pulling on machinery, etc. Which will translate eventually into washing very often, which will then result in a faster degradation. No one will be checking how fashionable you are in the gym. So many high street brands like H&M, Uniqlo, Asos, River Island, etc do gym wear that won't break your bank and would be more than enough, or even sports dedicated brands like the classic Nike and Adidas. Don't ever be fooled by designer gym clothes - those P. Plein 1000$+ combos are for the types who only go to the gym (ideally located on top of a very expensive hotel) to take two selfies in the mirror."
Anything can be removed if you try hard enough. Odds are it's just sewn on.
"The top one imo. 

The red strip on the bottom one makes it lean more heavily towards sporty/casual. Would look really good if accentuated nicely though."
"Bottom, I'd say"
Both are good
Pretty good as far as my experience goes. 
I have a pair of Quoddy moccasins that I feel change the vibe of my outfit enough from sneakers. Any kind of leather moccasin or boat shoe is good for casual and easy to pull off. Also those adidas are dope
"Those are pretty good shoes in general. I bought the pride version last month and I like them. Pretty decent construction. Although, I definitely feel like they are still in the world of sneakers."
"Clark's desert boots (CDB) are the go to in-between of sneakers and dress shoes/dress boots. Or casual boots in general. There's also the opposite trend of dressing down from shoes and wearing leather sneakers instead, so you might try that route as well. I personally prefer a nice chukka over leather sneakers, but it's up to you to experiment on your own and see what you like best, or what your environment calls for"
"Have you tried slim fit large tees? J.Crew slim tees are a great value at ~$20. Alternatively, higher quality tees like 3sixteen are very slim, so a Large will fit more like a big medium. Also, don't be afraid to go custom/made to measure if you're just not happy. I have a few tees from Son of a Tailor and they're pretty nice.

Go bigger; you can always shrink if you need to."
Assuming 74-88 is just cm these would be a size 29 x 34/35.
"They look like Chinese knockoffs. They're not ladies, though, as the button and zip would be on the other side of the fly."
"Get a stain remover for colours and pre-soak the item according to instructions. Then wash normal cycle possibly adding the stain remover as well. 

If that doesn‚Äôt work, well there goes the shirt. "
"I am 5'11 and 72kg (over 150 pounds) and I wear mostly small sized shirts and sometimes mediums. So medium is definately way too big for you. I am pretty sure small ones are not too short, but you can always look for some brands that have tall sizes as well if you want longer ones. Asket has tall sizes and you may want to go for small and tall, or even xs tall size. There are some other brands with tall sizing but I dont know any."
"I agree with /u/taduuu. I'm taller and heavier than you and I mostly wear smalls in tees. Can you elaborate what you mean by shorter? Is it too short at the waist? Also, what brands are you buying?"
"If you can afford it, go custom. Since you're not a standard off the rack size, no small or medium will fit like a glove. I recommend Son of a Tailor."
"Personally, I like the Arizonas, Madrids, and Milanos. Get whatever you like but I'd avoid the Gizehs; the strap is liable to detach from the sole rendering it useless. "
I haven't actually partaken in their tees but Uniqlo seems to be a subreddit/[Pusha T](https://youtu.be/udbVHKjsLmc?t=2m17s) favorite so they're definitely worth checking out.
"Budget?

* $25 or less: Bella Canvas, J.Crew, Target, etc.
* $50 or less: Jungmaven, 3sixteen, Lady White
* Over $50: Anything Japanese sold at Self Edge."
Selected Homme 
Probably not. I wear a 10 in Converse and take a 10 in most Alden lasts. 
"You could try re-lacing them. Most shoes come in a default cross lace, however a straight lacing can sharpen up the look of them with virtually no downsides."
"You do not need to tuck them unless they are way too long. And if they are too long, switch them to shorter ones. It is absolutely not a problem. Probably you just need to get used to them."
"Carmina is excellent value, I prefer dainite over leather soles, and I think style is largely personal preference. My first pair was a brown captoe Oxford, which you won't see people recommend. To me, they're cool. Most workplaces dress code are getting more and more casual, so there's more room to express yourself."
"1. Black Oxfords are more formal, but look best in conservative styles like navy, charcoal, and grey suiting. If you're in a dress shirt, tie, and dress pants... they'll be fine.

2. Depends on your location, walking level, and budget for resoling. Both Dainite and leather soles will last a long time, but Dainite has the added grip. The only downside to Dainite is that they take some time to break in.

3. Carmina is a great brand. If you can score Carmina Oxfords for $300, do it."
https://hypebeast.com/2017/5/best-affordable-techwear-fashion-brands-2017
"Falke, Pantherella"
"Darn Tough has some crap patterns, but their solid socks will last forever."
"It depends on the length. If it's long enough to stay tucked in, sure. If it's not, it's prrobably meant to be untucked."
I don‚Äôt see why not!
"Personally, I think tucking in to jeans looks off in most bizcaz situations. Jeans are very casual."
"Some people don't like the look due to a formality clash kind of situation, but I've never really seen anything wrong with tucking into dark jeans. I think it looks nice at least."
"That's not a common sweater, so it'll be hard to find that exact one. You could probably find something vintage in a similar style at thrift shops. "
I like some broguing so I don't think the walnut strand is too over the top at all.  I would look at Meermin's offerings though.  Same quality as AE and significantly cheaper.  You can go get 2 pairs of shoes from them for the cost of single AE pair.  
"just gotta say AEs, even seconds are pretty expensive for a young teacher. my vote goes to johnston and murphy as an acceptable affordable alternative and save yourself the $100 "
"It'll be fine, but normally you'd want to match your tie width to the lapel for balance/symmetry. "
"That's a pretty vague question, unfortunately. There are hundreds, if not thousands, of khaki chinos out there. Your best bet would be to go to the mall brand stores (Banana Republic, J.Crew, Gap, Club Monaco, etc.) and try on all the fits and sizes to find what you're looking for."
There‚Äôs product recommendations for chinos in the Basic Bastard article in the sidebar 
I have some scotch guarded/wrinkle resistant Dickies that look like any other pair of casual chinos. They make a 40-30 in a lot of their cuts.
Nothing off the rack will fit like you want. You'll need to go custom/made to measure if you want a heavy taper. I recommend Son of a Tailor.
Definitely not Red Wings. They look like some sort of hiker hybrid boot; the closest I've seen is Danner or Oak Street Bootmakers. Maaaaybe Viberg hikers.

"I‚Äôd look at your particular work environment. Do others wear loafers or relatively casual shoes with suits? If so you should be fine. If it‚Äôs very conservative, possibly not.

Loafers can certainly be worn with a suit, but it really depends on your particulars."
Probably but it depends on the suit and how confident you look wearing them which is pretty important regardless but especially so if you're trying to change up something as classic as a suit.
"Suits are obviously going to take the lion‚Äôs share of that amount. How many do you need and what are you willing to pay for them? For what purpose (General occasional wear, daily business wear, regular event wear)?

How athletic are you? Bodybuilder, strength, or other? Enough that suit jackets off the rack won‚Äôt work?

Gym and casual wear will be much easier and cheaper."
"I really like pair 2. I think it changes your style up a bit and gives you a new look. However, I am partial to the thicker and bigger frame style. I wear glasses as well and I wear Warby Parker‚Äôs Benson. "
Most of them look/feel the same as your current specs. Have you looked into contacts or lasik? 
Far and away the best brand I've used are Ninjasocks. They stay where they're supposed to.
"Some ""no show"" socks aren't actually low enough to go below the top of your shoe. SmartWool have my favorite no shows but they're pricier. You can find them frequently on sierratradingpost.com at discounted prices. Uniqlo is also a good option but the rubber heel tab isn't as grippy."
"stomperjoes, uniqlo"
"You probably will need the no-show socks that are much more scooped, ones you could almost hide with boat shoes or something. I like the Uniqlo ones, under $4 per pair if I remember correctly, they are hidden when I wear UBs."
All pants at Uniqlo are 34 inseam..have a ball

ASOS Design Slim/Skinny/Super Skinny Chinos are really great and really cheap. Look out for the multipacks for extra savings. They fit great and have a wide range of sizes.
"I‚Äôve handled them in store they‚Äôre still top notch.  You can notice that they‚Äôre textured but it‚Äôs not a bad thing, just different.  Wait until they arrive and see for yourself if you like them."

Alexander wang would be a step up designwise.  Some wings and horns pieces would fit the bill as well but they have a much more diverse line. 
Wings and horns. 
They look good but I wouldn't really try to dress them up. Some casual chinos and a (probably untucked) flannel/denim/chambray button-up would be about the most dressy I'd go.
"It's hard to say without a pic. Probably not a good look. Classic sneakers like Converse or Vans might look *all right*, but more modern black sneakers and beige pants are probably *no bueno*. You're likely to get a very ""heavy"" effect on your feet."
Get in touch with Guarded Goods or W.H. Earl.
No you are both fine. they make stuff in France and Italy and would seem Portugal as well if it came from END.
Many high end fashion brands are turning to countries like Portugal for manufacture these days. Particularly for cotton stuff.
"What is the garment? Usually simpler to make stuff like t-shirts, etc. have been moved to cheaper countries while higher-grade items are made in Italy/France - that‚Äôs true for a lot of brands. 

Also END is legit so I wouldn‚Äôt worry about that. "

Yea I‚Äôve gone with straight lacing it does look neat. I think it‚Äôs just the bow at the top. Although I‚Äôm thinking maybe the laces are too long and therefore looking baggy. So shorter laces should look neater. 
I think you may be right on both fronts. Going to get shorter laces. I kept checking out other people shoes today while walking. Most people have laces in a bow and not tucked in. So may be something I need to get more used too.

They‚Äôre legit.
My answer was a soft no to the pinstripes because they're costumey.
"They can work but if you're looking to invest in a better suit for regular wear, stick with a more versatile suit. Check out suit supply for some modern fits on pinstripes. I think they look great, honestly. I would still caution against it for now though.

https://us.suitsupply.com/en_US/suits/hartford-navy-stripe/P5405I.html?cgid=Suits"
No worries. I bought about 4 pairs of them and rotate accordingly for work. Well done on the weight loss! 
"It's one of those brands/lines that is perennially about $200 and not totally terrible. Think Bar III, Ryan Seacrest, Hugo Boss, etc."
No prob and good luck with the clothes!
"Yeah man no problem,hmu if you need anything else haha"
I would probably just avoid the color that‚Äôs very close to the pants color myself.  All their other offerings should be great.
"Depends heavily on the occasion. But generally a good Derby will be appropriate for more formal gatherings while a nice white or black sneaker would be ideal for a casual evening around the town. You don‚Äôt want an overly fat belt, especially when pairing with the dress shoes. Stick with 1‚Äù-1.25‚Äù tops. You can get away with 1.25‚Äù-1.5‚Äù belts with the sneakers and chino look.  Without question your shoe/belt choice will swing which way the outfit goes, be it casual or dressier. 

Also a boat shoe could be a nice touch as an in between. It‚Äôs hard to tell if the pants are slacks or more of a chino so you‚Äôll have to use some of your own judgement."
"As with anything, it mostly depends on your budget. I can recommend the styles, but you would have to do the scouting and adjusting to your budget.
If you do insist on pulling more items made of linen (I understand how hot it can get during summers), I would advocate to get one good shirt and one good pair of linen trousers first, then a pair of normal tailored-type trousers like the ones from Officina 36 and one other non-linen top, like an aqua blue or bleumarine polo. Then wear them as separates  - meaning the linen shirt with the normal trousers and viceversa. Or together, so be it. I'd also look for the linen shirt to come with a cuban-style collar like the the one from Caruso. I am a strong believer that there is never a temperature so severely hot that would constitute an excuse for a man to show his barefeet in public, apart from the pool, the beach and the sauna. Therefore during the summer I even go for a pair of very nice desert boots in dark brown with some solid sole. Brands like Rockport use Adidas soles and you will be able to feel more comfortable in them plus walk miles and miles without fatigue - more than many dedicated sneakers could afford to offer. In 2009 I bought a pair of Churchs desert boots after seeing the ones Daniel Craig wore in Quantum and they lasted me for 7 years, as I took proper care of them. They even work with a full linen outfit and they look amazing. People would normally associate these with the colder months but you only need to look at them in a summer outfit combination from a different point of view to realize how stylish they can be. Sorry for the big links but this is a comment and I cannot modify the titles.

Hope this helps"
"I personally prefer the navy, as I like to wear pink in the summer and gray in the winter, but obviously black matches just fine with everything."
Most. Just don't do it without a jacket. 
Try having chino shorts with regular t-shirts. You will have a better appearance but still have a casual look. Chino shorts are really versatile.
"The whole jacket looks too ""try hard"", IMO. Hard pass from me."
"Tbh I'd either just drop the extra for SLP or go for SeF, Sandro chelsea boots just end up looking like cheap wyatts"
All of my wife's jeans have the button fixed on the left side (when you're in the jeans) and the outer fly flap is on the right. 
You *may* be a 10.5... but I'd recommend trying it on in person before purchasing. 
Most of my shoes have leather soles and I don‚Äôt really notice excess noise. 
"Then wear jeans with an untucked shirt.

It is either a casual enough environment for jeans, or formal enough that shirts remain tucked. Not both. In my opinion."
"There are some areas where AE eeks them out.  I have 1/2 dozen or so from each maker.  I think Meermins are close enough for all intents and purposes that they can be placed on the same general level as AE in terms of quality, fit and finish.  "
Most tees are fairly square-cut - similar width at chest and waist. A taper means they will be wider at the chest and narrower at the waist.
Going from wide to slim.
"Some good places to look for suits that are commonly recommended would be; J crew Factory and Macy‚Äôs Bar III ($200-300); J crew and Spier&Mackay ($300-500); and Suit Supply ($400-600). For general use a basic charcoal or navy suit is what you should look for; both of you want options. You will also need a couple dress shirts (white, light blue), a pair of dress shoes or two (one black, one brown), a few basic ties.

For casual wear it really depends on what you‚Äôre interested in. Basic Bastard in the sidebar can be a good start."
Fair enough. I like pair 3 then. 
Fair enough. I preferred contacts to glasses when I needed them. 
"I mean, they *do* look kind of ""bulky"" because that's the style of the boot, but no, they don't look inordinately big on you.

One thing I often do when wearing Red Wing-style boots is go for a slightly boxier top. (outerwear in colder months, shirt otherwise) To me, that balances out the ""weight"" of the boot. Simply wearing a top in a darker color might also work."
"Plenty of shoes could work with those. If you're into sneakers, navy/blue/white type stuff should look nice. Stan Smith, Converse, Killshots, Vans, Converse, etc. Lighter grays could work ok too.

You could also wear loafters, or chukkas, or derbies, or boat shoes- and so on- in any shade of brown that's at least a little darker than the pants but not *dark brown*. Darker browns could read too ""heavy"" again and the same shade as your pants just looks weird."
It just means that particular garment was manufactured in Portugal. Made in x doesn't indicate what store it was shipped from and I believe END has their own warehouse.
Just say no to dadcore.
Opt for black Bluchers or Derbys then.
I answered your other post.

Article goes in a roundabout way to talk about confidence. I remember that one post about how some of you guys don‚Äôt wear denim jackets because it‚Äôs ‚Äútoo‚Äù out there. Replace the shoes with really any article of clothing. 
"I think for loud sneakers, its easiest to just tone down the rest of the outfit.  Black denim and a plain tee + loud sneakers is fine.  "
"Severe lack of fits in the article. 

Otherwise, pretty decent read."
"Buying something that doesn't fit your wardrobe risks triggering the [Diderot effect.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diderot_effect).

This is part of why we advise building a wardrobe *slowly.* Don't follow a whim and buy a dozen items in pursuit of a specific style, as you'll be out of luck if you soon decide that a different style would suit you better. Instead, buy maybe just a few key items and see if you grow comfortable with them - if so, then you can certainly continue pursuing that general direction. 

On the other hand, it's ok to develop interests in different styles over time. And if you intend to make a stylistic shift, you're going to have to start somewhere. 

What do you guys prefer when shifting styles: a gradual transition in which you acquire items that could work with both your current style and the new goal, or do you dive straight into the deep end with sudden changes toward new stylistically polarized items?"
"Photos/ layouts would have really helped the article. ""These clothes don't work with this shoe, but these do."" "

"When did denim jackets become too out there? Thats like, a perfectly normal article of clothing I see on a daily basis. "
That's weird. That's too out there?
"It's funny to think I got into fashion as I got more confident and now I rely on my fashion to give me confidence

ouch"
Just be loud loud loud. 
"For me I don't think I ever really changed styles. If anything when I branch out I still have a foundation based on my personal taste, which is ""streetwear."" So if I do buy a far out piece I always find a way to tie it back to streetwear or at leas to the pieces that I own. So for me, I wouldn't say its a gradual transition but more of the fact that I can take other pieces and make them work with my own personal style.



"
*on
It sounds crazy but people think that denim jackets are hard to wear.
It was definitely a thing in some thread recently. I thought it was in MFA Wears: Denim Jackets but I didn't see any of those comments. 
"Naturally, this also gets into the utility behind various ""mfa uniforms"" and starter basics - the idea being that certain simple, core items can be tweaked in a variety of different directions based on what you add next. 

But tbh, even some really basic stuff is going to paint you into a bit of a corner by being incompatible with more extreme styles. For example, I might advise a beginner to start with a well-fitting pair of blue Levi's and solid t-shirts. But if that newbie grows to favor Rick Owens or Dries Van Noten looks, those basics just won't add much anymore!"
It sounds crazy because it is. Lol
Denim jackets are what I wear when I don‚Äôt want to be too creative and want to tone down everything else I‚Äôm wearing...
"True but if someone is going to go and move to the dries look there are still pieces that can go between. So lets say that a person wants to buy a Dries shirt. They go out and buy a pair of black trousers or black denim to wear with that shirt. While that dries shirt would look different for the levis, those black pants can still go back and forth between the different styles. Then maybe they wanted to go the Rick Owens look they have a pair of black pants that could work with some of his clothes. 

I think when you start going into very truncated or specific looks, you have to acknowledge how much its going to cost. If money is no issue then go ahead and go full Rick or Dries. But I think what most people would do is buy a single piece from a designer and then  start building around that. Mostly due to the cost of the item. While they might find a steal price on grailed theres still the real possibility that its going to be their biggest clothing purchase. 
"
"Most people don't really start to focus on fashion until, well, ever in their life. Some might end up wearing the items by accident, but they put together outfits based just on look, not on a (conscious) understanding of color theory and fashion. Even people who dress well without thinking may become intimidated by clothes easily because they think of something as ""out there"" even if it's tame, because it's different. When you ""get"" clothes, things aren't ""out there"", they're a color, pattern, texture, and silhouette."
"Within fashion minded groups yes but my friend group consideres me fashion forward when I wear dark jeans, white sneakers, a white tee and a denim jacket. "
"I've been intimidated by blazers lately. Lol I want to get one as I just love jckets in general and its something I don't own yet.

Worried its not going to go with my clothes as I don't dress very upscale at all. Raw denim and linen shirts and work boots mostly. Not sure how a blazer fits in there yet. "
Which sounds pretty darn vanilla no matter how you phrase it...
"If you can get a nice casual blazer in grey, not charcoal, but grey, then you‚Äôve got a great outfit there with everything you mentioned and a white button-down. It is, however, on the mature side. Idk what your job or age is, but I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs more of a white-collar/engineering/research look for someone in their 30‚Äôs or at least late 20‚Äôs. Especially because you‚Äôll want a nice fit, nothing super cheap or boxy.

If you‚Äôre curious, I‚Äôm pretty sure we have an item guide for it."
It is very vanilla. The point is that even vanilla outfits can look very high fashion to people who don't know fashion. 
"I'm 29 and my ""job"" is home hospice technically. I'm currently employed by my grandfather in law as his caretaker. 

I have no reason to dress nicer but I just want too. Figured it would be good for job interviews later and date nights with the missus.

I've got several of the guides and inspo posts saved and read through but I need to check them again. I don't know what but something is making me hesitant. "
Good point. Wearing the MFA uniform makes you look like a fashionista to the general public. 
"I'd chalk it up to having clothes that actually fit. The same outfit (Dark jeans, white sneaks / tee, and a jacket) could look terrible if whoever is wearing it bought everything in the wrong size."
the obsession with jackets/layering when it's 90 degrees outside makes ZERO sense
">Summer style, like any other part of the year, benefits from having some kind of jacket. If you can get away with it, a casual suit or sport coat can be a wonderful thing this time of year.

It's worth noting Derek is the person I stole [this](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DhjAPNNV4AAXfc-.jpg) from.

That said, I'd say there's a strong argument to be made for the average guy to have his ""one blazer"" if he doesn't wear much formal wear, be a very light, unstructured, summer-friendly one. Most weddings are in the summer, and I don't know about anyone else but I'm usually too warm in a jacket regardless of season. You'll be more likely to actually wear it when called for."
it's hot during summer. i'm wearing a tshirt and shorts whenever I can. I'll leave the cool layering for other seasons
I was going to post this elsewhere but my summer purchasing advice is just buy cheap short sleeve shirts from maybe H&M And maybe some cheap polos and just wear the shit out of them because they‚Äôre going to get destroyed sweaty and take care when you wash them and hang dry them but don‚Äôt put too much of your budget into anything summer shirting wise Except for maybe a stunner piece or two
"Honest question: do you guys think that outfit in the main picture and in the thumbnail looks good? I know this stuff can be subjective, but I think it looks hideous. Sorry if this isn't constructive, I'm just curious about what others think.

edit: i also don't have any problem w/ the article, some of those other examples are good, and i agree w/ what a lot of others said, that dressing in layers in the summer heat makes no sense. i just want to be comfortable in the heat, which means less clothes for me."
"Honestly a cool/unique, or even a white t-shirt with shorts/jeans and slip-on vans is the move for me this summer. Fuck a jacket in the summer, that's some bullshit and always has been. I feel like part of looking good in the summer is just not really trying too hard and just having cool unique shit to throw on. I have a few interesting band t-shirts like [this Twin Peaks](https://twinpeaks.kungfustore.com/apparel/cream-bulls-tee-twn01.html) one that I love and feel like stands out on its own right.

Also cuban collar shirts are a look for me at work. Sometimes this sub just needs to take it a little easy on the fashion and just follow the vibe that's going on. I think it's more about looking good and having style, not so much dressing the loudest."
I'm not sure I could pull off many of the looks in this article. Maybe I could but wouldn't feel comfortable. 
I just bought some D-ring belts just to spice things up a bit. We'll see how it goes.

Derrick Guy lives in either SF or the East Bay. His weather is not normal. 
90 and the heat index and humidity make it feel like 98 or higher. Craziness.
"That's all I buy because I live in Texas. Yoox is a great resource for unlined Italian made summer friendly blazers, at incredible prices. I picked up LBM 1911 for under 100 and boglioli for under 200 on sales. The fabrics tend to have an open weave and are summer weight wool or wool/linen/silk blend.

Italian cut blazers also are a bit looser and drapier with high button stance, they look good on muscular and broader men. Plus they're great for more casual summer weddings."
"It's for this reason I've considered springing for a nice unlined blazer/jacket. SuitSupply had a sale on some recently iirc but I just don't have an urgent need so I passed.

I think it definitely depends on contexts. I get a lot more wear out of my jackets/suits for things like interviews and such, not weddings. "
"> ""one blazer"" . . . be a very light, unstructured, summer-friendly one. 

agreed with this.  if you don't have to wear jackets or suits to work, you could get byy with a spring/summer jacket for those events and then a charcoal or navy suit for all other events, including fall/winter weddings."
">That said, I'd say there's a strong argument to be made for the average guy to have his ""one blazer"" if he doesn't wear much formal wear, be a very light, unstructured, summer-friendly one. Most weddings are in the summer, and I don't know about anyone else but I'm usually too warm in a jacket regardless of season. You'll be more likely to actually wear it when called for.

I think this is why J. Crew's un-suit saw a lot of positive attention, and I wouldn't be surprised if we saw more unstructured unlined stuff going forward. There are some challenges involved in making an unstructured suit, but one clever manufacturing technique, and they could go very mainstream."
"this might be a pragmatic piece of advice to some, especially beginners, but there are a lot of interesting shirting options that can't really be fulfilled by fast fashion.  not only that, but to some, me included, i don't look at fashion as disposable really.  i'm not so interested in replenishing my summer wardrobe every year."
"Great advice, I buy a handful of cheap shirts from cotton-on(australia) at the start of every summer then throw them out at the end once they‚Äôve started to go out of shape/get wrecked by the sun. "
"I think the outfit is fine, even if not to my personal taste. He's paired a 'bold' patterned shirt with plain pants and coordinated with a few simple accessories. Certainly not something that would raise eyebrows in a place like NYC (which is my reference point). He's wearing the outfit with a relaxed carelessness and seems to be comfortable in his own skin, just living his best life."

He lives in East Bay (which has pretty normal summer weather) but likes to pretend he lives in SF (which has very abnormal summer weather). 
"If you don't mind me asking, how do you know how they'll fit if you're just ordering them online? Isn't that a gamble, especially with something like a blazer?"
How does making an unstructured suit vary from making a lined suit?
"Check my follow up posts - the ONLY fast fashion I own is solid colored summer shirts that I know will be destroyed in the summer by sweat, dirt, sunscreen etc. 

I fully believe in investing in clothing - my go to summer shirts are all very well made but I recognize that I can‚Äôt justify wearing $150 shirts every day in the summer "
"Yea and if you buy the correct colors and launder them correctly, they‚Äôll age nicely too"
Just find album art that is printed on a shirt instead of the band name. 
"I live in the east bay and work in sf. You're spot on, both in the difference between sf and east bay weather and that fashionable Bay areans like to say they live in the city.

Edit: the east bay is very much not 90 degrees though, it's been ~75 this week "
"Dunno about Yoox, but generally retailers (including eBay sellers) will provide garment measurements. You simply compare them to the measurements of the jacket that fits you best and then hope for the best."
I buy and return what doesn't fit. Or try in store.
"Structure and lining are kind of different.

Structure refers to the guts of the suits, for the most part. An unstructured suit might use very little fusible or canvas, or none at al. Usually little to no shoulder padding, lapel padding, etc. And lining does play a role -- it does provide some structure -- but it's not the defining factor.

Fusible and canvas are used, in part, to hold the inner and outer layers of the suit in place. Without it, the person making the suit has to more carefully stitch the right parts together by hand. So you need a better tailor, and he's likely to make mistakes in which case he has to start that all over.

I've never made a suit myself, or seen one get made, so my knowledge here is limited. But that's the main challenge, as I understand it. "
"gotcha, makes sense.  "
"Yeh you could do that, the ones I get are known for being terribly made but they‚Äôre cheap ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
There‚Äôs a balance of course unless you‚Äôre a millionaire and or have disposable income. Where do you live? You might have more flexibility than me
"Hahaha well that‚Äôs the spirit!!

I‚Äôll say this - my ‚Äúnicer‚Äù summer stuff from our legacy and Sunspel and Patrik Ervell still look essentially brand new after weekly wears over the course of 3-5 summers. I won‚Äôt wear them if I‚Äôm going around the block etc but when I‚Äôm out in public I think they‚Äôve been great investments "
"i live in a warm climate (80-90 F in summer) and will wear a variety of s/s stuff from a variety of different brands like beams, battenwear, gitman, portuguese flannel, etc."
"I gotta ask, are you ever going to post in waywt? I don't mean that in a mean way, genuinely curious. Your reception here can be pretty polarizing sometimes, but you do, on occasion, give solid advice and have good insight. And that a solid list of brands so I'd be curious to see your style"
"no, probably not.  i do not feel inclined to take or post pictures of myself.  i think it's perfectly reasonable and fine that others do so, but it is not of interest to me."

Thank you /u/MFA_Nay for continuing to provide MFA with the content they want. It is always interesting to read through these and read the historical perspective. "
Antonio Banderas has a whole fashion line based on capes. He's trying to make them a mainstay of men's fashion again.
"Updooted. But still weird re-reading topics, as an AskHistorian daily trawler. :P"
And just yesterday in Random Fashion Thoughts people were talking about them!
"Of course the only man I can imagine to rock a Cape flawlessly would be their modern pioneer, of course."
I honestly like cloaks. 100% legit and don't care how much a meme they are. 
"While being peeved at the delay is understandable, that you sent all your dress shoes at once and now don't have any to wear isn't really their problem. "
"The front line rep probably didn't know how long the factory would actually take. Production queues and back orders on existing recrafts. The initial rep set the wrong expectations for you, obviously, but this is pretty typical of any company. If they had 400 recrafts ahead of you, you are number 401. Expedites don't usually actually happen on the manufacturing side. 

Still no consolation to you. But in the real world this is quite normal.  "
"It's bad that your shoes are being delayed, but I'll be honest: not only is this a likely scenario even in modern days, there's little here to justify someone being fired. It's worrying how you value 4 pairs of shoes (that you'll end up receiving eventually) over someone's livelihood.

Sales reps. don't know the ins and outs of production, and in most cases they don't have direct means of communication to them. It would have been nice if they communicated things to you in a timely manner, but the only way you'd get them done in a rush is if AE was a small shoemaking house where you can speak with the owner, and not a large company that has to stick to standards.

Take note of not sending all pairs but one next time you need them redone."
"I have to be honest, dropping off all but one pair seems silly to me.  Why not do a few at a time even if you thought it would be 2-3 weeks.  They should not have told you 2-3 weeks, but you couldnt wear one pair for 3 weeks straight anyway.  If you kept 2 you would have been in much better shape.      "
Grow up and get Aldens
I had to return a brand new pair for QC issues.  Instead of sending me a new pair they sent them back to the factory for inspection and fixing.  Took about 2 months.  Wtf.  I have only purchased 2 other pair directly from AE all on sale.  But at this point I've moved on from AE.  They are definitely not worth their MSRP and their lasts are boring to me.  The only time I see myself buying AE are if they are a hell of a good deal on eBay.
"I did my last recraft about 10 years ago and it took 6 weeks. 

Now I just buy cheap and in good condition AE from eBay and sell them when it‚Äôs time to be recrafted. Note that the only pair of new dress shoes I‚Äôve ever purchased are the AE‚Äôs that I had recrafted. The depreciation is in your favor. 

I think I lost at the most $50 on a very well worn pair of loafers that I bought like new on eBay then resold. I‚Äôve made money actually on some shoes that I bought used and sold after 50-100 wears "
"When you spend that much on shoes you expect better. Probably get better service from most retailers. 

Can you snag some Florsheim shoes or something in the meantime?"
"I'd also be upset about this, but just out of curiosity what have you been wearing for the past 3-4 weeks? Or did you plan the recraft around time off from work? "
I didn't. I still have 1 pair left. What I'm upset about is being told I would get a service in a set time and it not being adhered to or was notified about it.....after I paid them. 
"That's true, I'm not sure they are obligated to give OP any store credit or by him new shoes, but the fact is they entirely misrepresented the timeframe of their service, and are effectively holding OP's property hostage. At the very least, OP deserves an entire refund on the service. I would expect expedited shipping to return the shoes as well."
This isn't 1940. We have computers that can send mass emails. Real time updates shown on other websites. Why is this acceptable today? 
"Then say ""They typically take 2-3 weeks, but depending on productiom queue volume, it could take X weeks.  You would need to inquire with *insert the party who actually knows* to get a better estimate.""  You know, basic customer service shit.  Don't just throw out info if you're not sure its accurate."
This
"Valid question. In my job, I have a window of 3 weeks where I can dress down (business casual). I kept the 1 pair just in case something came up or if the shoes were a couple days late. "
Ok. Have some wingtips in 12D?
Exactly. This isn't Kmart's plastic loafers. 
I planned around this time.
"I'm not sure why you mentioned that now you have to purchase 1-2 pairs of new shoes then... just wear the shoes you have.

Also everything I've read online about AE recrafting says 4-6 weeks turnaround."
It's not but ae is such a circle jerk brand on reddit you'll get a lot of 20 y/o kids defending anything they do because they want to believe the shoes they bought are magical and the company is perfect
Hahaha actually that pair is McAllister wing tips but wing tips aren‚Äôt my style 
"
>Also everything I've read online about AE recrafting says 4-6 weeks turnaround.

4 weeks just another week past what I was told. I'm now facing 7-10 weeks
"
most 20 y/o kids do not have ae's. Though there is a pretty big circle jerk for an overpriced company.
"Agreed. Recently moved to the USA and saw them for myself... after reading so much about them online I was totally disappointed at their quality. 

Poor leather, poor stitching and general construction. 

Expected so much from them and was looking forward to my first pair of AE but now I‚Äôm back to English shoes. "
I'm going to need something. Wanna dm me some pics and info if you're interested in selling them?
"Sorry, but my experience has been completely different. I've bought a few pairs of shoes from AE and they all have been outstanding quality. "
Mine are 11s and they‚Äôre my job interview shoes and best believe I‚Äôm hoping to use them!! Check eBay. 15% off today in the app 
Why not use this opportunity to upgrade to Church‚Äôs or Alden etc?
"Unless they have a reasonable clearance sale sometime, they're out of my price range. "
Used 50-100. Like new maybe 150. Trust me - even used they‚Äôre worth it. AE isn‚Äôt even in the same league 
I assume eBay?
Yup
"Read a great story this week about a guy who had surgery and resulted in having clubfoot with two different sized feet - 9 and 13.

He was getting annoyed about buying two pairs anytime he needed shoes, so he put an ad in the paper looking for someone else with opposite sized feet. In a completely ridiculous turn, he found a guy about his age who needed the inverse size he was looking for only a few miles away. They're in their 70s now and are good pals.

I did find I didn't attach the supply line quite correctly so there was a little drop on the first run. Fixed it and after 3 cycles we appear to be good
"coworker found out his water supply line to the fridge had been leaking for what seemed to be a few weeks. 

just a slow enough drip that they're gonna have to rip out a bunch of flooring and make sure everything is still structurally sound. "
"Same, wore my french jersey to the office"
oh oops I thought I was in that thread. Thanks. 
"For dress I have two pairs of Clark's with the ortholite insoles. For around I have Jordan 1's and some off model of Adidas that I actually got for free. For athletics, I have Brooks Ravenna 7's. I always thought Brooks was a shitty off brand turns out they're legit! "
I've watched enough HGTV to be deathly scared of water damage
"That's my nightmare, I'm in a condo so if I leak into the unit below me it's gonna be real expensive real fast"
Sounds like a nice selection of brands and styles! Heard good things about Clark's ortholite insoles in the past.

what other hijinks will we get into on this episode of Property Brothers "
You have insurance right?  A standard HO6 policy would cover that and since it is a liability claim you wouldn't be out any deductible. 
"Oh cool, yeah I do. I'm pretty uninformed about insurance but I have a pretty comprehensive policy according to my family member that does know a thing or two"
"Make sure you have enough personal property.  No one ever thinks they have as much as they do.  If everything burned, what would it cost to get back to today, everything down to wash cloths, shampoos, socks up to couches, computers etc. And on a Condo, usually betterments and improvements are on you as well so any renovations you did. "
"would betterments be covered under personal property as well? I only have 20k but worry that I might be out a bit more, especially once my planned shower remodel goes through"
"It depends on what company it is written with, they all list it a little differently.  If you only have $20k in personal property you most likely don't have enough.  Stuff adds up really quick when you really start to get into it.  What would it cost to go out and replace your wardrobe today?  Now add your bedroom furniture, new, today.  Same for everything.  What is the new cost of everything you own and would need to replace?  Call your agent and let them know what your renovation costs are going to be and then go from there.  

That being said, if you are renting this, it changes things significantly. "
"The nice thing is I don't have *too much* nice stuff, yet. Just quick mental addition of the expensive items I own, and appliances, and we're up to around 15k.  Good point about talking to my agent, I'll do that! Thanks"
"Yeah, no worries.  And Personal Property insurance is really cheap.  You might be surprised how cheap it is to up it to $75,000 and have the peace of mind knowing you have plenty of room. "
Then I can replace my dogshit fridge with one of those fancy ones that will remind me when I'm out of milk
Thank you for facilitating this! I'm so excited.

"The r/legaladvice community would like to welcome our guests from r/all and/or r/popular. We are glad you are visiting. There are a few things you should know before you post here:

**We lock update posts that do not contain additional questions**. There are two reasons for this. First, this is a forum for legal advice and if none is sought, none will be offered. Second, those posts were moderating nightmares filled with off topic ranting and pointless arguments. We welcome update posts - particularly when a poster reports that they used our advice successfully. Even when they are locked in r/legaladvice there is almost always a discussion of the update in r/bestoflegaladvice for your popcorn needs.

**Nothing here constitutes the formation of an attorney/client relationship**. This is not a substitute for an informed local attorney. At best, the advice herein assists the posters in taking the first step toward resolving their legal issue.  

**We are not a popcorn sub**. We remove posts and ban posters who do not participate in good faith. We lock posts that meander off topic, devolve into pointless bickering, or result in too many reports to the mods. This is not to say that there isn't entertainment to be found here, indeed that is why most of us became involved in the law. It is fun. And when justice results, it is rewarding as well. 

**Our rules are in the sidebar to your right**. They are available in detail [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3jm6u2/the_law_of_the_land_please_read_before/) and our wiki is [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/wiki/index). For those of you who want more popcorn and fewer vegetables we invite you to visit our sister subs /r/bestoflegaladvice and /r/legaladviceofftopic. 

**Shitposting and brigading will earn you a permanent ban**. We respond to the situation at hand and the laws that apply.  This is not the place to grind your political axe or talk about what you think the law should be. If you want to change the law, get involved in local politics. 

**Personal anecdotes are not useful**. This is not the place to talk about how once your sister's roommate got out of a ticket by doing X. The fact that you have an anecdotal counterexample is not proof that the advice offered is wrong. 

**This is legal advice, not moral advice**. Sometimes we have posts on hot button issues such as abortion, child custody, rape, racial prejudice, sexism, and so on. People come here to learn about their legal options. Advice relating to their immortal souls can be found elsewhere on reddit, online, and at local mosques, churches, temples, and philosophy departments. Sometimes, however, legal advice is indistinguishable from life advice.

Thank you for visiting our sub. We hope you enjoy your time here and consider subscribing.

She's full of it. You would only maybe be liable if you on purpose went to extra effort or tricked her into eating something you knew would cause a reaction. If she can't live with other people then she needs to live somewhere without a roommate. The list of restaurants you can't eat at is laughable. 
">  I also have a list of restaurants that are an allergen trigger that she says I can't go to.

This is insane. There is no way you can trigger an attack just by having been in a restaurant. She is either mistaken, or this is a huge red flag. You don't want to get involved with a roommate this controlling."
"Her allergies are HER allergies, not yours.  She is the one who needs to take extra precautions, not you. She‚Äôs being unreasonable, and if her allergies are that sensitive, she should be living on her own. 


Eating a cheeseburger at home isn‚Äôt criminal behavior, you‚Äôre good. "
"False.  As long as you aren't reckless or try to poison her or something, she is responsible for choosing living circumstances appropriate to protect her own health.  

She certainly can't tell you what restaurants you can eat out at -- that's completely absurd."
"I feel like she‚Äôs trying to irritate her way into getting to live alone in the dorms. You wouldn‚Äôt be on the hook unless you deliberately triggered a response, though. "
"The only way you would be liable would be if you purposefully try to feed her anything she is allergic to.

I.E. If you force fed her some peanuts, then you would be liable.

That said she has no right to say where you can and cannot eat as a result of *her* allergens, she would only have this right if you had purposefully invited her to dinner, which given that your already sick of her is highly unlikely.

The only way to determine if she is lying would be to find evidence that she is capable of eating her *supposed* allergen triggers or catch her in the lie itself (I.E her saying that she went out for ice cream, which is a dairy product).

Also your use of RA and Hall director makes me think that you are a College Student, if this is in fact the case you may want to get in contact with the Director/Coordinator/Head of student life at your institution.

That said your already making a smart decision in trying to get out, but to be safe I would do some research into food allergies so you know how to avoid triggering a reaction from her, and so you can call her out on any misinformation she tries to present to you.

**TL;DR This chick is full of it, get in contact with the whoever is in charge of student life (if your a college student), and research food allergies to protect yourself and be able to call her out on any and all bullcrap. She also has no right to tell you how to live your life.**"
">  she claims that if for some reason I trigger a reaction, I'm on the hook for the medical bills because I didn't take proper precautions.

She can claim a lot of things. This claim is in particular total bullshit.

She cannot dictate what you can and cannot eat, nor can she dictate what you bring into the apartment. 

Frankly put, if she were that allergic to that much so that even potential contact caused a reaction she'd already be dead. "
"That‚Äôs not how any of this works. As long as you aren‚Äôt intentionally contaminating her food, or saying something is free of her allergens but you know it isn‚Äôt, you‚Äôre fine.  
If she really has allergies so severe that she requires this level of accommodation  (and hey, those do exist so it‚Äôs at least possible), she needs to contact the school‚Äôs disability services and submit a request so she can get a solo room. That‚Äôs what they‚Äôre for."
"I know I‚Äôm going against the grain here but when I was at uni our housing contract included provisions that we could not bring food that roommates were allergic to into our dorm rooms. 

Might want to check if you have anything in yours as it sounds like you are in a dorm. "
This is an official dormitory? Sounds like she needs to file for a medical accommodation for her own room. 
How would she know it was *you* who triggered a reaction as opposed to someone she passed in the hallway who rolled in peanut butter?
"This is not how allergic reactions work. Generally speaking as long as your roommate keeps herself from eating the trigger foods she knows are bad for her, she will be fine, therefore it's none of her business  what you eat or where.

If you guys share a kitchen and /or kitchen utensils make sure you wash properly what you use in case you prepare something w  her trigger foods but other than that you don't need to take extra precautions, she's just an entitled brat demanding that you accommodate her for something that is easily managed. "
"I cannot think of any legal authority that would force you to comply with her list of restrictions, with the exception of purposefully exposing her, such as putting peanuts in her food.

She is responsible for her own life and well being, not you.  If she feels she is unable to be safe in your presence, it is her responsibility to remove herself from the room, ask for different housing, whatever she needs to do.  She is just trying to make you do something instead of her.

You are perfectly free to look at her list, and simply say, No.  "
"She should have been placed in a medical single.
"
[removed]
"IANAL  but what was the schools rational for denying you a move?  



I‚Äôve had complicated food allergies and roommates and it‚Äôs my job to manage me. Not them.  (But yes I know bits can be an issue) 


It‚Äôs good that your parents will get involved.  Schools usually listen to parents more, as they‚Äôre paying the bills. "
"Press the issue personally with the director/dean of housing - call, or make an appointment and even sit in their office area waiting for them if you can't get an appointment.  Use your roommate's statements and positions that you want no part of having to deal with her.
"
"She's lying. The only way you'd be responsible is if you purposefully contaminated her food with known allergens.

Go eat wherever you want. She should be living alone instead of forcing unreasonable rules on her roommate."
"No. Also, if the allergies are this serious, she should talk to disability services to request a single room. I had similar accommodations in college. "
People with allergies that severe should be in a single. Just like someone with dust allergies can get a room with no carpet she can talk to either disability services or just to residence life or whatever they call it.
"I would go to the housing office and request a meeting. The RA and RHD may not have a room or the ability to move you. But the housing office would be able to, especially if you explain that you have tried to accommodate your roommate, but these restrictions make the room unlivable for you. Also slip in that she has mentioned suing you, and they might be involved since they are aware of the situation. Better yet, try to get a hold of the university's legal department. This may get things moving faster if they think the university could be liable."
"So, question. If an allergen food were kept in a shared fridge and she ate it accidentally, that would be on allergy girl as it's her allergy and it's on her to manage it. Correct? "
"I would suggest you advise her to get a medical note sent to the whoever is in charge of your housing so that they can make the appropriate accommodations. The requests are far reaching enough that it is hard to believe, but I like to give people the benefit of the doubt. I would ammuse her requests for several days, which shouldn‚Äôt be too difficult, or at least not let her be aware what you eat outside of the dorm."
"The only person responsible for her allergies are her. That is unless you intentionally spike her food with something.

But in all honesty, I'm gonna guess that your roommate doesn't actually have these allergies and instead has a severe eating disorder."
"Go to your local bed and bath and buy candles, people with alergiens cannot tell the differance. "
[removed]
"With all the crazy shit she is saying she‚Äôs allergic too, sounds like she is lying about everything imo, but please don‚Äôt ‚Äúsee‚Äù if she is by doing anything sneaky"
[removed]
It is really unfortunate that OP has such a bad roommate. 
"With how severe peanut allergies can be, I would actually be quite concerned going to someplace like Texas Roadhouse that serves bulk peanuts where the entire place essentially is covered with peanut shells and then home to someone I know has that type of allergy.

That being said, I think that if accommodations this drastic are needed of a roommate, where multiple dietary allergies need to be avoided by the non-allergic person, then the allergic person either needs to find a similarly allergic roommate, or live alone."
"The only one that could really cause an issue is nut allergy, because nut oils tend to linger. I have friends and family with dairy, red meat, and shellfish allergies; they're all about consuming those things. Nut allergies can also be contact because it's the proteins they're allergic to."
"> Also your use of RA and Hall director makes me think that you are a College Student, if this is in fact the case you may want to get in contact with the Director/Coordinator/Head of student life at your institution.

To add to this, most universities have an office of accessibility to help students with disability. Since she has multiple life-threatening allergies to common foods, she might be able to argue that having no roommate is a reasonable accommodation for her to attend school."
"Still, I don't think that OP would be liable for any medical costs, would they?"
"This is correct, at least when I lived in the dorms. 

OP - bear down a bit, into the semester more there will be movement (kids leaving, etc.) and you'll be able to go elsewhere. Or you can find someone on the floor with just as a restrictive diet to switch rooms with. "
Maybe avoid shelling peanuts or cracking other nuts as the dust can get in the air and cause issues from inhalation but the other stuff should just use extra cautions to clean well and scour the sink after preparing foods.
I've been in a 'needing to move' situation and sometimes they quite literally have nowhere to put you. They over schedule rooms thinking kids won't show/go to another college/etc. There's overflow; a lot of times kids end up in hotels while they sort it out. Just one experience but I've heard of it happening elsewhere as well.

Is there any evidence that someone has had an allergy attack caused by being in proximity of someone who was around peanuts earlier?
"I‚Äôm thinking the roommate is trying to wrangle a single, with the space and cost of a double, and that‚Äôs part of why housing denied the switch."
"Thanks for the catch there!

I can't believe that actually slipped my mind!

OP you may want to talk to your roommate about this, if you do be sure to bring up how you may accidentally slip up, or that any potential roommate may not be nearly as careful.

Edit: This is of course assuming this lady isn't overly controlling and is legitimately concerned for her own safety"
"Might be considered actionable negligence if it actually caused a reaction. I‚Äôve dated people who were extremely sensitive to fish and nuts, and having those things in the living area would not be a good thing. OP has been put on notice about that by his roommate. 

 However, the no red meat/no dairy/can‚Äôt go to these restaurant thing is insane. I‚Äôd put money on the roommate just being a nutty person. No pun intended. "
"My best friend ended up with four other girls sleeping in the lobby of a dorm building our freshman year. EVERY FLOOR in the building was like that, with twin beds and dressers shoved in there and paper put over the glass walls. As spots opened up in regular rooms, they‚Äôd move out of the lobby. My friend was lobby‚Äôd until late September.

I went to a different school, thank God."
"I had a friend in high school who had to eat in a room by herself because of her peanut allergy. If she smelled peanut butter or anything with peanuts, her throat would start to swell and everything. 

I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs happened tbh"
"I would escalate this to the housing department, she basically has to be in a room by herself if this is true -Not your responsibility to cater to her illnesses or pay her medical bills, but theirs and hers. The housing people should have been told this before assigning her a room, allergies are dangerous. "
"> OP you may want to talk to your roommate about this

Good point - they both want the same thing. Allergy girl wants to have her own room, OP wants to not be in the room with her. They can work better as a team."
"Yea I agree the roommate is being crazy, but tread with caution op. 

iANAL but I can see op being held responsible. Or at the very least drug threw a civil suite, which depending on the reaction may be more than small claims. "
Yup. That‚Äôs how allergic I am to pineapple. I carry a rescue inhaler and epipen just in case. 
There's no way everyone in the dorm is following crazy roommates strict rules about allergies. If she's that allergic she would not survive in a shared dorm. 
"Exactly and if she is that allergic it did not start right before college so she and her parents and housing would know her accommodations needed before hand.  It is up to her to deal with not the roommate's.I would say nope, not until I see proof from the housing and medical departments that she MUST have these conditions."
"You can say nope as much as you want, but if the roommate dies because of OP, ""nope"" seems unlikely to cut it in the court of public opinion or of law."
"I have  life long severe allergies to food and drugs, it is up to me to deal with this and inform the housing /college what I need to survive, not to put the responsibility of the roommate. It is not the roommates responsibility to pay for any medical bills if they did not delibertly try and expose her.  Still big nope to push her responsibilities on the roommate.  Would you put your life at risk on someone you just got assigned to be roommates, or would you let college know months ahead of time your accomodations and request a single due to severe health problems? That is what nomal people do,not put their health on your head."

"First and foremost, anyway to setup a security camera at your apartment overlooking your entrance or your vehicle? They may be worth investments considering the situation. Even an indoor security camera may be worth investing to provide evidence of how well the cat is treated, though make sure to get roommates permissions. Dash cams can be wired into your car, even hidden, to record when the car is off and parked.

I would start off with a restraining order. I‚Äôd start compiling and getting all relevant police reports together. Not sure if the broken windshield would be worth showing as it seems like you have no evidence unfortunately. 

Also please be aware, she is watching everything that is written here and may be taking counter actions to these counter actions that will be suggested by others.

**Edited to clarify**"
"Wow. What a crazy person. I don't really have any legal advise for you, but I'd start keeping a 3rd journal detailing her harrassment of you. Screen shot her facebook posts, texts, and any emails you get. Include the police reports and anything from animal control and APS. Just compile everything you have on this girl that's related to her harassment of you. That way you can easily present it if this would come to court.. which it sounds like it will."
"I would let them into the house so that they can see that: no you're not abusing your cat; you don't have an elderly lady you're holding hostage; and you don't have any children.  At this point it will only help your case against F.  Tell them this all started because you did not *clean* the litterbox three times a day and this is why she feels you are being neglectful.  This may help them see the type of crazy you are dealing with.

Her getting the DA involved is good for you because the DA could turn around and charge her for wasting time and resources on bogus calls.  Document everything.

Also cleaning the litterbox three times a day is excessive.  A family member of mine has two cats and they only scoop the litter once a week and change the litter every couple of months.  They improvised litterboxes with two large shallow rectangular Rubbermaid storage containers for the two cats and they really only need to be scooped once a week.  Also one of the cats is an indoor/outdoor cat, who is absolutely terrified of birds because he pissed a blue jay off once."
"Can you reach out to the agencies she's harassing you through and get any paperwork they have, then use that to get a restraining order? It might also be a good idea to save her Reddit post where she debates breaking and entering, as well as any other posts that reference you."
"Restraining order, definitely start this to get her to avoid leaving you alone and possibly reach out to the police for charges of harassment. This is ridiculous "
[removed]
"You should reach out to your local PD and get an RO against this person. 

Once you have it you should reach out to the various departments they've been calling on you and inform them that you have an RO against such and such individual.

Lastly I would highly consider finding a lawyer who specializes in harassment and file a lawsuit against them."

"Yep. We have 3 cats, 4 boxes, and 1 teenager. 

He scoops the boxes once a day, but skips days too, because...teenager. It's not a problem. At all."
"My cat will not even use the box if I clean it completely. I have to leave a small piece of urine clumped litter in it or she will pee on my small rugs in my kitchen. Cats are really weird with litter box cleanliness. If the schedule she has is working and the cat is fine with it, changing it might cause problems. It is possible my cat is just a snooty girl and likes things her way. "
"Scooping the litter once a week seems a little too long - but then, if I don't scoop the litter for my furry terrorist at least every day he might piss on husband's clothes, lol."

Now that that is broken you have to dump the bowl out and refill it everyday.  This is also the same damn cat that does donuts on the toilet seat, gets dizzy and falls in."
"The litter boxes are not normal litter boxes, they are repurposed 70 qt Rubbermaid storage containers with lids, though the lids aren't in use.  These boxes can each hold a 42 lb bag of cat litter.  These cats will let you know if you aren't scooping enough, they poop in front of the container if you are one day late scooping.  I had to house sit for them and frankly I don't mind scooping the litter but please, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, do not kill a friggin mouse and then bury it in the litter for me to find latter in all of its maggot infested glory."

"I'd say all you *should* need is a copy of your copy of the form you signed to give to them.  Because they kept calling asking if you want to renew, they likely lost the form you signed.  The fact that you got the email on a day the office isn't open also leads me to think they never updated their database or whatever and it's doing automated things based on the incorrect data that you are not leaving.

Is the form counter signed by one of their agents?   That will help prove you gave it to them on the date stated on the form.
"
"Lol, previous Leasing Agent here. I think I know exactly where the office is fucking up. Don't worry, as long as your signature isn't anywhere they can't touch you. It's time to march right up tomorrow, ask politely for a manager, show them your notice to vacate, and ask to see your file. If you don't see your notice to vacate in there, hand them a COPY (notice the word COPY, preferably one you made beforehand) to put in your file. Email the office today (or the manager if you have their email address) with your concerns as well and let them know you'll be stopping in. When someone arrives in the morning the email should be the first thing they check and that will give them time to pull up your file or at least give the manager a heads up.

Depending on what system they use it should let the manager know who's been working on your file. Ask that you be taken off their call list- sometimes they'll have a big spreadsheet with everyone who hasn't renewed and they just call everyone because they need their numbers up.

MAKE SURE nothing says ""signed electronically"". Check your email to see if they ever sent a lease. Log into your resident portal if you have one, most resident portals now a days have a little tab with ""Documents"" and you can check on your end to see if there's anything electronically signed by you."
"Is your lease just between you and the landlord, or are both of you and your roommates names on it?"
"Are you and your roommate on the lease together? If so, you are not returning possession of the unit to the landlord if you vacate and roommate stays. Doesn‚Äôt matter if you gave 30-day notice that you are leaving. Sounds to me like you are subletting to your replacement. 

The only way for you to get out of the lease is if all the parties to the original lease agree to terminate it in writing.

If you were on your own individual lease and complied with the terms required for termination, giving them the copy should suffice."
"I‚Äôll have to double check the portal and make sure nothing was signed. The only thing I‚Äôve signed recently was my current roommate and I agreeing to terminate our lease so he could sign a new one with his new roommate, and the form stating I was going to vacate. Thanks for the info. "
"Yeah, I rented at a large apartment complex where the apartment manager's criteria for hiring office staff begin and ended with ""Is a hot babe"" and as a result everybody who lived there struggled regularly with the fact that the office was constantly screwing up and losing everything that could be lost. Packages, lease renewals, maintenance requests, rent checks, everything. It was ridiculous and also the first thing I thought of when I read the OPs tale of woe."
My roommate‚Äôs name and mine are on the lease but we got it in writing to terminate the lease so he can sign a new one with his new roommate. 
My roommate and I already terminated the original lease in writing before my former roommate signed a new one with his new roommate.
"Hm, depending on how low tech their office is I‚Äôm wondering if they sent you that last email once they processed your roommate‚Äôs renewal and just sent an auto email to everyone currently living in the apartment."
"Maybe, but they‚Äôre not low tech. The owner of the apartment complex has different complexes through my college town and the surrounding. It‚Äôs the most popular leasing agency. 

But this apartment‚Äôs staff are not the best. When I first applied for this apartment I also filled out a pet application and was approved to have my cat live with me. Then when I went to pay the pet deposit, they said they never okay‚Äôd a pet and I was living in a pet-free apartment. Luckily my girlfriend was able to take my cat in. 

Then a few months later a maintenance man saw a cat toy and I was fined $250 for housing a pet without paying the deposit. I had to provide insane evidence that my pet was never inside the apartment, and then I was asked if I wanted to pay the deposit so my cat could live with me. When I asked them about the pet-free apartment, they had no idea what I was talking about. 

I‚Äôm very happy to be leaving this place. "
"Yeah if they‚Äôre high tech + incompetent it‚Äôs 100% someone hit a little ‚Äúresident renewal email‚Äù button for ‚Äúapartment #000‚Äù without bothering to check if everyone in apartment #000 renewed. Sorry you‚Äôve had to deal with this, most front of the line people don‚Äôt actually have a lot of training (aside from mandatory Grace Hill training which teaches them the law but now how each building does things like pet deposits). This is why anyone reading this (ESPECIALLY college students in student housing) should make sure to keep email records of what was said by whom and rarely do things face to face without sending a recap email.

Out of curiosity do you know the parent company to your building? A few conglomerates are buying up a lot of student housing and young adult housing and since they‚Äôre going through rapid expansion the quality of training is...not the best. Just trying to see if my hunch is correct or if it‚Äôs just a case of small local fuckups."
"Not legal, all hours worked should be paid to you. He can either pay the hours owed or report to the TN department of labor and workforce 

The only exception is if you‚Äôve worked over 6 hours and are taking a lunch in which you aren‚Äôt doing any work. "
"Im not a lawyer, but I worked for a restaurant for 9 years that constantly tried to do things that were against the law. A lot of employees were too broke to question anything out of fear of losing their job. Bravo to you! Here's my one tidbit of advice:

Keep your pay stubs and try to keep any evidence of your times clocking in and out. Some places have it written (take photos) others are digital with printouts. Good luck!"
"Correct. An employer can mandate an unpaid break (such as a mandated lunch break), but they cannot deduct pay for a break that did not occur."
Talk to another lawyer. There is a 3 year statute of limitations so you only have a few months left to do something
Talk to another lawyer.
You need to call personal injury lawyers until you find one to take your case. It should not be difficult and most of them work on contingency.

"Without location, I can't comment on the legal issues very much, but I wonder if age of consent laws might come into this. I strongly advise you to contact RAINN or another organization that helps victims of sexual assault, and to inform you parents. They can help you prepare to go to the police and report this.

Edit: since you're the same age and in Pennsylvania and we're both 14, age of consent doesn't come into this. However, the rest of my advice still stands. Tell your parents, get support through RAINN or a similar organization, and go to the police. "
">depression and anxiety so it‚Äôs possible that he would claim mental illness,

So, what you are saying is, he wants to claim that he has a mental disorder that prevents him from understanding the consequences of his action, and makes him a danger to those around him?

How well do you think that will REALLY go over in a court setting?

[RAINN](https://www.rainn.org/) was mentioned, but not linked. Call them, and ask for references to victim advocates.  Note: Victim advocates are trained in emotional and psychological support of abuse victims, as well as capable of helping them through the reporting and trial process. "
"The feelings you are having are understandably distressing but entirely normal. This is not your fault, and you have nothing to be ashamed of. If your parents are supportive/safe, talking to them is a good first step, as is contacting an advocacy organization like RAINN. 

And  while I am not familiar with PA law, specifically (and hopefully someone who is can chime in), what you have described, at least in part, is a criminal act in all 50 states. Know that because of your perpetrator‚Äôs age and likely status as a juvenile offender, the process may be different (and in my state would be more informal and treatment-focused for the offender).  Regarding evidence, your statement is evidence. And an experienced police detective can help collect more evidence, including what‚Äôs known as a ‚Äúpretext‚Äù conversation via text or telephone that‚Äôs along the lines of what you‚Äôve described in terms of giving the perpetrator the opportunity to incriminate himself and have that properly documented by law enforcement. (Importantly, this is only an opportunity with the element of surprise - meaning, before the perpetrator gets wind that there may be an investigation, so it‚Äôs important that you and your family not discuss any report to law enforcement with anyone but police if you do decide to report.) And, the vast majority of cases do not proceed to trial. 

Rather than getting focused on things that might happen down the road (though it‚Äôs completely understandable to be anxious about that), right now, take care of yourself, get some support in terms of your parents or a hotline or both, and know that you are strong and capable and have time to decide what to do in terms of whether you want to report to law enforcement.

Original Post:

LocationBot 4.0 | GitHub (Coming Soon) | [Statistics](https://locationbot.info) | [Report Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/locationbot)"
Thank you. I am from Pennsylvania. I‚Äôm going to speak to my therapist. I‚Äôm not comfortable telling my parents as of now but I will definitely look into other resources for support. 
"I definitely need time to think about what steps I want to take. But I am going to talk to my therapist about what happened. I think my biggest fear is that he will never change. He has been in many treatment facilities and programs  for many issues throughout his life but he still is a very troubled. My goal is not to ruin his reputation and I‚Äôm afraid that will happen if I pursue legal action. I just want him to realize what he did was very wrong and for him to never do anything like this again. I‚Äôm thinking that maybe my family and his could handle this privately. I think if my parents were to contact his mother and explain the situation, she would take the proper action to get him help. And if not I would look more into legal action. Thank you so much for your response. "
"OP, I responded to your initial post in a separate comment, but just now saw this - know that your therapist is likely a ‚Äúmandatory reporter‚Äù and due to your age, that the sexual assault you‚Äôve described is something he/she may be legally required to report to police. So, while I support you reporting to law enforcement, just be aware that talking to your therapist might mean a law enforcement report is made without you having any part in that decision. You might want to ask your therapist about his/her mandatory reporting requirements and their own policies before you make your disclosure. "
Your therapist is a great resource to start with. I hope you get the support you need and deserve through this process.
"It sounds like you are planning to talk to your therapist, and that‚Äôs a great resource for you as long as you understand his/her potential reporting requirements. And certainly, he/she is the most qualified to help you walk through your feelings on this and how you‚Äôd like to proceed. But from my experience working with victims of sex assault, I will just say this:  You are not responsible for his feelings, or his health, or the outcome of his life. And it is not your responsibility to protect or shield him from the consequences of his own actions.  Even if (IF) he comes to realize, in time, that what he did was very wrong (and fully integrated the substantial effects and consequences for you of his crimes), it will likely not be without significant treatment. And it won‚Äôt necessarily guarantee he won‚Äôt do this again, because the same factors that existed to facilitate his assault on you will still exist absent intervention. And while that intervention can take many forms, sometimes (especially for juveniles) that intervention comes via the criminal justice system. "
Thank you for the input. I will talk to my therapist about the reporting requirements before I discuss what happened. And I may just tell her what happened for the very reason that she would report it. I would feel more comfortable with that than taking the steps myself to go to the police. 
"Thank you for the perspective. I agree with you that he needs serious help and that may come in the form of consequences. Your comment has helped me realize a few things. In my relationship with him I neglected to take serious action in attempt to get him to stop what he was doing to me, and because of that he continued to take advantage of me. I need to take serious action now because what I had done before was not enough. I gave he enough chances to correct himself. I will look more into legal action. "
"Just so you know, just because you‚Äôre therapist reports this does not mean you have to participate in the investigation. 

Talk to your therapist about what happened, and talk about your concerns about reporting this. Sexual violence is emotionally brutal, and you will be a much happier person if you start to deal with it now. 

Don‚Äôt allow worries about the police prevent you from getting the help that you need. "
"I‚Äôd go into my local precinct and insist on filing a complaint.    They can‚Äôt hang up on you face to face. 

Edited to add:  you may also want to try attending your local community board meeting and raising concerns about noise pollution there as well!"
"Continue to make complaints, and keep a journal of the noise. Find out who the landlord is and start putting the heat on them. The owner of the property is responsible for any nuisance on their property that they know about, so make sure that landlord knows it's a serious problem when your right to the peaceful enjoyment of your apartment is interfered with. The cops will be of limited help in these situations; the best recourse is through the neighbor's landlord.

Find the owner via ACRIS, fyi.

(Similar thing happened to me in NYC, and the above was how I resolved it)"
Can you record the party and take that in to the precinct when you complian in person?
That sounds like a professional operation. Do they have a liquor license? Are they following food service codes? 
"The specific neighborhood you're in will have a significant impact on any police/311 response.  UES? They'll listen.  East NY? They'll get right on your complaint, just as soon as they finish the calls about the multiple stabbings, shots fired, and home invasions, e.g., maybe around November 2021."
"I couldnt take it. I lived in NYC as well in an apartment and I understand the cons of living in a building with shared walls. But upstairs sounded like a stampede all day, next door sounded like a taping of Jerry Springer and downstairs was pretty much a club.

I contacted 311, called the super, management company and called cops. No change. The super has even called the cops on them himself. 

My nerves were shot and i was so on edge. As soon as my lease was up I left. Ive never felt better. "
"A friend of mine experienced something similar. His solution was to put one of his sound effects CDs of a cow mooing on repeat, turn the stereo volume all the way up, put his speakers down on the floor (he lived above the partying neighbors).... and then spend the night at a friend‚Äôs. 

Never had a problem after that."
Get some kind of massive speaker and play extremely low and high frequencies alternating. Make sure you have some nice isolating headphones. Alternating between them makes it impossible to ignore and adjust to. Do this until they stop. 
"NYC resident who's had similar noise problems.

If the parties are in anyway associated with a bar or restaurant or venue serving alcohol, go to the community board and make a complaint. It'll help.

Continue calling 311. Get anyone else upset in your area to call as well.

"
"Not sure about NYC, but other places I've lived have a separate office that investigates noise complaints. Try searching around the code compliance pages to see if you can find one. 

Also consider installing an app on your phone and keep recordings of times of day and decibels, most places have different allowable levels for different times of day."
Where in NYC?
"Hmm maybe a spite wall of speakers or sonic crowd disruptors would do haha. Seriously though these parties sound like quite the operation, and I am curious whethere they are pulling all the proper permits-- that may be one way to at least temporarily shut them down. 

"
"Yes, actually! The 311 operator I got a hold of last night was actually the best one I'd *ever* spoken to, and she suggested going to the CB. I'll be heading there after work tomorrow for sure! I don't think the board meeting is until next week, but I'll see what information I can get from them in the meantime. Thank you!"
"I don't know this for certain, but it's in a house. What if the owner *is the one throwing the party*?"
Would it be legal to live stream it so the cops can see it in real time?  (I had neighbors who would silence up every time they saw a cop car come in the lot.  You couldn't hear the parties from the road.)
"Lol I do this, YouTube continuous bass loop.

See I like to play the slow game, wait till 4 5 am when it's over.... Then it's my turn to unleash hell"
"Talk to your neighbors as well. I'm sure your neighbors aren't happy about this either.

A local politician cannot ignore a bunch of angry voters in his or her district, even if that district is just a small part of a city. A lot of people all complaining about the same thing is an issue your local community board has to pay attention to."
"Yeah, that would make it harder to DIY since you'd lose leverage. In theory, you could sue, although that comes with cost (and you'd absolutely need that noise journal, and a DB measurement would be very helpful). 

Have you talked to your landlord about it? She/he should have an interest in ensuring tenants are able to have the quiet enjoyment of their apartments.

I've had the misfortune of having similarly noisy neighbors, and I gotta say I feel for you. I'm not just uttering words there: I could feel my blood pressure spike when I read your OP."
"IANAL, but assuming OP can hear the party from their house I don't see why they couldn't have a stream run in their yard/porch."
"On top of that get the neighbors to start calling 311 and the precinct none stop. We did that in my neighborhood and it stopped the music for few months.  

When it started again, few of us shut it down for good. "
"Thanks so much for your help. With so many complaints and so little response, I started wondering if *I* were in the wrong, but your sympathies make me feel a bit more noticed and validated."
"No, you're absolutely not wrong. You pay a lot of money to have a tiny slice of the world where you can relax, and anyone interfering with that is a bad person.

The cops probably won't help much, nor is it clear they should: this is ultimately a civil matter, and they're best viewed as a way to gather evidence (eg, phone records and logs showing 311 calls, formal complaints down at the precinct). 

FWIW, there's no wrong answer here: I gotten a neighboring LL to shut the noise down, and I've also moved when I didn't think the headache of more formal legal process wasn't worth the cost. "
"The r/legaladvice community would like to welcome our guests from r/all and/or r/popular. We are glad you are visiting. There are a few things you should know before you post here:

**We lock update posts that do not contain additional questions**. There are two reasons for this. First, this is a forum for legal advice and if none is sought, none will be offered. Second, those posts were moderating nightmares filled with off topic ranting and pointless arguments. We welcome update posts - particularly when a poster reports that they used our advice successfully. Even when they are locked in r/legaladvice there is almost always a discussion of the update in r/bestoflegaladvice for your popcorn needs.

**Nothing here constitutes the formation of an attorney/client relationship**. This is not a substitute for an informed local attorney. At best, the advice herein assists the posters in taking the first step toward resolving their legal issue.  

**We are not a popcorn sub**. We remove posts and ban posters who do not participate in good faith. We lock posts that meander off topic, devolve into pointless bickering, or result in too many reports to the mods. This is not to say that there isn't entertainment to be found here, indeed that is why most of us became involved in the law. It is fun. And when justice results, it is rewarding as well. 

**Our rules are in the sidebar to your right**. They are available in detail [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3jm6u2/the_law_of_the_land_please_read_before/) and our wiki is [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/wiki/index). For those of you who want more popcorn and fewer vegetables we invite you to visit our sister subs /r/bestoflegaladvice and /r/legaladviceofftopic. 

**Shitposting and brigading will earn you a permanent ban**. We respond to the situation at hand and the laws that apply.  This is not the place to grind your political axe or talk about what you think the law should be. If you want to change the law, get involved in local politics. 

**Personal anecdotes are not useful**. This is not the place to talk about how once your sister's roommate got out of a ticket by doing X. The fact that you have an anecdotal counterexample is not proof that the advice offered is wrong. 

**This is legal advice, not moral advice**. Sometimes we have posts on hot button issues such as abortion, child custody, rape, racial prejudice, sexism, and so on. People come here to learn about their legal options. Advice relating to their immortal souls can be found elsewhere on reddit, online, and at local mosques, churches, temples, and philosophy departments. Sometimes, however, legal advice is indistinguishable from life advice.

Title: **[Final Update, Payday edition!!] An r/legaladvice wet dream: neighbor cut down two of my trees. What should I look for in a lawyer?**

Original Post: 

> Sorry for the delay, but that will be explained at the bottom. 
> 
> The Arborist came out this past Wednesday. Prior to this meeting, and this whole mess, I had taken trees for granted. I simply assumed that you would plant a seed, they would grow, you'd cut them down, make shit, and the process would repeat. But no, I was informed by this mystic man of nature, trees are far more complex. 
> 
> They takes years to root. Some trees need more dirt and ground to establish themselves. Some are more valuable in certain areas, with historical roots to the area. Some are incapable of growing in neighborhoods if infrastructure has since been built. And some trees produce different ""veneer quality"" logs. 
> 
> White Oak Trees, or *Quercus alba*, is apparently one such tree that is highly sought after for veneer quality logs. They're used for furniture, for banjos here in the South, for all sorts of woodcraft. And, as the magical treeman told me, they're damn tough to grow in neighborhoods. Their roots don't let them grow in neighborhoods, and they shy from urban pollution. His point, is that if you had two white oak trees of veneer quality cut down from your front yard, is that they'd be irreplaceable. New ones could never regrow to that 100 year old size ever again. 
> 
> Because of that, Treeman, God of Dollars, stated that $1000 per year, per tree, is a base compensation. 
> 
> Sorry for the delay. My lawyer has been smelling blood in the water, and wanted to ensure whatever I posted wouldn't put our $200,000 tree case in jeopardy, and wanted to go over it first. 
>

Calm down. There's nothing to do until there is an actual breathing baby. If that happens you get a paternity test and go from there. Right now you don't have to have any contact with her and it sounds like it would be best not to. You don't sound emotionally ready to be having sex.

Yes, you are not obligated to see the child. You will definitely have to pay child support though, if it turns out to be yours. "
"If there is a baby and she claims that it is yours, have a paternity test done. If it is indeed your baby, no court or judge can make you actively parent (they can make you pay child support, which you seem to be aware of), although it's kind of sucky that if there is a child and it is yours, you'll subject that child to life with an unstable person just so you don't have to deal with that person."

Title: **Past partner claims to be pregnant I have my doubts its mine, and using this to get my attention but unsure**

Original Post: 

> So background, I met this person online, told me she was in the states all this time and what not, we fell in love, and planned to meet and be official couple. When I first met her after thr first date she tried to kill herself after I didnt reply back to her one night. She was admitted to the hospital and was there for 3 days on watch. During that her male roommate tells me she was never in the states, he flew her out from her home country to be with him and they have been for months planning to live together and stay together. I came to her house twice out of fear she might try to kill herself and also out of guilt that maybe this was all ymy fault for her trying to. Both times we had sex because I felt if I say no or dont she will try to again, I never came in side her, the first time I just didnt come and couldn't do it for more then 5 mins the second time same thing but i finished my self off outside of her as she laid next to me and just decided to lick what came out. After that day I decided to lose touch feeling I cant be ruled with this guilt and I have to snap out of it. A month later now she says she is pregnant and keeping it. She is apparently only here on Visa she isnt a citizen or resident. I have doubts she is pregnant or that if she is that I'm the father because I never came inside her but knowing my luck I'm sure some way it's possible maybe this is.
> 
> So what I want to ask if she is pregnant, can I not be apart of the childs and her life? I dont want to be in the cycle of she tries to kill herself  or having me feel guilty about it. I understand if I have to pay child support but can I just not be apart of the childs life or hers at all but just do child support payments. She doesnt work and supports herself on him and I'm sure she wants to keep the child for the child support money to aide him and her seeing she doesnt work. They arent married but they live together since he flew her out.
> 
> I just feel like a complete idiot for being ruled by fear and letting it go where it has and would love any legal help anyone can offer. Again I doubt she is pregnant or if she is that its mine but if it is, is there anyway I can give up parental rights on my own and just pay child support and never see her and the kid? Can the child be put on adoption with a family that will be stable and not at risk in? What can I do? I just dont want her to guilt trip me or happen where she tries to kill herself again. Any advice would help. I just dont want to be apart of that childs life or hers if she is in fact pregnant and it is my child.

"Okay that's my main thing there. Is there anyway the state or somewhere can tell her where I live?
How will I know if she is claiming its mine and I have to do child support or anything?"
"Ideally I would want to put the child in adoption but if I know her now and the guy she moved here for she will just have the kid or claim its mine for the child support because they need that money in the situation they are in, I'm sure he cant support her as it is and he is in a bad situation himself, so I'm sure they are looking for the money as well.

It's unlikely the activities you describe resulted in a pregnancy.  But seriously don't have sex with somebody because you think they will kill themselves if you don't that's messed up.

I honestly thought if I wasnt around or chose not to see her she would try it again, even her partner she is living with and basically always been with but never told me made it seem that way to me... I was scared because she did it once and was sent to the hospital by the police for care so I knew she was capable of doing it and had the means to....I was just scared "

"> where the impossible is always possible in a bad way towards me.

Conception under the circumstances you describe is unlikely but not impossible. If you don't want a child and especially don't want a child with this person, don't have unprotected sex or sex of any kind. You are not a victim if you put your penis inside a person and a baby comes out."
"Let's say worst case scenario, she is pregnant and says its mine, how will I know or where can I check that in being asked for child support so I know I can do a paternity test to make sure. I also think it's unlikely that but like I've said...I'm not the luckiest guy ever <_>"
"First of all, don't do anything that could be seen as accepting that you are the father. This would include being involved in prenatal care, or voluntarily paying anything toward the child (assuming she's actually pregnant).

For her to get an order for child support, she needs to go to court (or, if she's receiving certain government aid, the government needs to go to court). If you are served papers, show up and challenge the assertion that you are the father - if you fail to show up, a default judgement will be entered against you. At this hearing, you have the right to request that the court order a paternity test. Test shows you're not the father? You're clear. Test shows you are? Court will order you to pay child support. Since you're not married to her, there is no ""presumed paternity"" which, in most cases, can only be overturned within a very limited window - and in some, can only be overturned if someone else steps in and takes responsibility.

For future reference, ALWAYS use condoms - they're the only form of non-surgical birth control a man can be sure is being used properly."
"Then you can be required to pay child support. You can't be required to have a relationship with the child or the mother. If you want, you can petition the courts for shared custody. (but not right away, infants usually always stay with their mother)"
Thank you for the information! 
"I rather not fight for custody just because I dont want to be on either life just because I know how she is, I know how her partner is and they both at times would passively make me feel guilty and I rather not have the ch ild be brought into that middle or go through that I understand I'm a scumbag....I rather just not be involved and make payments if I'm in fact the father and if she in fact is pregnant."
"Yes it is legal, but not wise if they are scheduled drugs. Also the venue may not let you bring the container in"
Go to the pharmacy and get small single use labeled bottles for each medication. 
I don't see the reason you would get stopped and searched. I'd be more worried about someone stealing them all if they were just in a bag. Even wen you get searched the people searching shouldn't just refuse you coming in if they are your prescriptions 
"A keychain pill container might be a good investment for you both for the concert and longer term. I have one for my scheduled meds and it allows me to carry an extra dose with me so I can say, go to dinner after work without being late on my medications. Carrying a copy of your prescriptions isn‚Äôt a bad idea either, in case of a medical emergency the paramedics would appreciate knowing all the meds you‚Äôre on."
Why wouldn't you just take your meds before you go? Put them in your pocket if they are needed to take at certain time. 
"From what I've been explained, it isn't legal in Ohio and prescription drugs need to be carried/transported in a marked prescription bottle.

Please feel free to correct me if I'm incorrect. 



http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/3719.08"
"What size bottles do you think the pharmacy has? The smallest size that's usually carried is a 13 dram vial, and carrying 4 of those would be unwieldy. 

What I might do is get copies of the labels from the pharmacy and carry those with a pill container...but seriously, OP, if you're really on 4 controlled substances, just ask the pharmacist if you can delay dosing by a few hours. "
"The concert is at 7pm, I have to take one pill at 8:30, and the other 3 at 9. If I was stopped by police for some reason, a pocket full of pills with no prescription info could get me in a shitload of trouble. "
Nothing in that section requires the patient to carry the prescription in the bottle it was dispensed in. That section is about what pharmacists must dispense the drug in
"Some pharmacies, like CVS, offer the option to create individually packed pills ([https://www.cvs.com/content/multidose](https://www.cvs.com/content/multidose)). Each pack is for a particular time of day.  The outside of each pack is labeled with the prescription label information (prescribing physician, prescription number, dispensing pharmacy, name of medication, etc.) meaning it is perfectly legal/acceptable to carry individual packs around.

([Pillpack.com](https://Pillpack.com) offers a similar service, but I'm not sure if their packs contain as detailed of information as others.)"
I‚Äôm not sure on the exact size. I have put 6 of them in my pocket with 1-4 pills each for a 24 hour overnight from home with no issue. 
Have you asked your pharmacist or doctor if you absolutely couldn‚Äôt make a deviation in that schedule?
I'd be surprised if the pharmacokinetics of these drugs were such that they could not be safely taken a couple of hours early or late. Only your Dr or pharmacist can properly advise you though. Ask. 
"You can call the police, if you want.  "
"Call the police.  Also, check the restraining order - see if it lists you on it. If it does not, ask the police to help you with amending the order to include you. 

Your gf can use these statements to justify asking the court to limit him to only supervised visitation.

> He recently lost his parenting rights and the majority of his visitation time.  

You mean custody. If he has visitation time, he's still got parental rights. "
Have you considered the possibility that the father has not made any threats...and that the child is simply messing with you?

Title: **First time post...please help. Receiving threats from father through children.**

Original Post: 

> The father of my girlfriends kids (ages 6 and 3) has been using them to threaten me. I get comments from the oldest about how he‚Äôs ‚Äúgoing to beat me up‚Äù and how he‚Äôs ‚Äúcoming to get me‚Äù. I‚Äôll save the time and let you all know that he‚Äôs an abusive lowlife and my gf has a restraining order against him. He recently lost his parenting rights and the majority of his visitation time. What, if any, action can I take? I prefer not to settle this with my fists but I will defend myself as well as her and the boys if it comes to it. I have nothing in writing, only the words of the 6 year old. I realize there might not be much but these threats seem very real. Thanks for reading.

Yes but I think that‚Äôs highly unlikely. I trust the kids word. He‚Äôs a violent person and has physically assaulted her and his kids. He has motive because I‚Äôm the boyfriend and he‚Äôs getting upset that I discipline them from time to time. Disclaimer: I‚Äôve been in their lives for about a year. Disciplining didn‚Äôt start right when I came into the picture. The guy is basically a sperm donor with visitation rights. They look to me like their father figure and despise going to him. 
"You are talking about legal custody. He still has parental rights, meaning he is legally recognized as the father. Your girlfriend has sole legal and sole physical custody.

Your girlfriend‚Äôs physical custody is only interrupted by the father‚Äôs right to ‚Äúparenting time‚Äù aka ‚Äúvisitation.‚Äù She may want to consider asking the courts to modify his parenting time to be limited to supervised parenting time where a neutral third party is always present.

">It turns out my dad was continuously bleeding in his mouth from the surgery, and it was dripping into his lungs forming a blood clot

I'm so sorry that you've had such a disaster happen, but the blood clot in his lungs most likely didn't form from continuous blood dripping from his throat. The clot likely formed in the veins of his legs and traveled through his veins and got stuck in his lungs. I don't see any sort of negligence, just bad luck.

If you have serious concerns, the only legal answer is to look for a medical malpractice lawyer in your area."
Medical malpractice is highly fact dependent and outside the scope of our subs. You can get a low cost consultation with a Med Mal attorney.

"Speaking with a lawyer would be reasonable.  I also think it's worth asking some questions of the doctors, because part of their job is to help patients and their families understand what's happening medically.  Tell the doctors that you're trying to understand what happened, and that you aren't sure if the blood clot was in his airways or in the blood vessels.  It sounds like you're describing a ""pulmonary embolism"", which is a blood clot inside of the blood vessels of the lungs, and which can sometimes cause the heart to stop (a ""cardiac arrest"").  As Hippo-crates is describing, this often originates in the legs and then travels to the lungs.  If it is a pulmonary embolism, it's hard to see how the surgery or the ibuprofen would have caused it.

If you still have unanswered questions about what is medically happening for yourself or your loved one, ask the doctor to explain it to you.  You always have an ability to talk to a lawyer later."
Thanks! Appreciate the advice.
Vague description of job and nonsensical question? Yeah dont give out medical advice. 
Really inappropriate and not the time to try and diagnos over the internet. 
"My father was in good condition before the surgery, and has really had no prior health issues before the surgery. It'd be a massive coincidence that this just happens afterwords and is unrelated. Possible, but I think that's unlikely. 

I appreciate your written responce. I'm not a doctor and have only to go off of what ive heard so far. This helped clear up some of my confusion."
"Was your dad doing a lot of resting after the surgery? Clots in the legs actually can form due to prolonged periods of inactivity. This is why they are decently common in students and people who take a lot of long-haul flights. Many people can have them for a very long time and not realize they have them until they end up having an embolism. 


As the above poster commented, it is extremely unlikely the surgery directly caused this. We do see a lot of posters come here out of grief and anger after a bad medical event and maybe 1 or 2 ever has had a real malpractice claim. I know it's tempting to look for something to blame, but there might not be anything. Please, be kind to yourself as you work through this event. My greatest apologies to you and your father."
"It's not so much that it was necessarily unrelated, as that a blood clot is more likely to happen after a surgery because you're not moving around as much. This is a know complication of surgery. Whether the hospital was negligent in not bringing your father in after he complained of coughing and pain isn't a question anyone here can fully answer (other than that tonsil removals are generally painful, and ibuprofen isn't a blood thinner, so it would generally be better after a surgery because you don't want to bleed excessively around the surgical site). Just the clot alone is generally more of a bad luck situation, rather than anything anyone could have done differently. As.far as I know, anyway, which might not be very far and a consultation with a malpractice lawyer might be worthwhile.

I'm sorry you and your family are hurting, and I hope your father makes a meaningful recovery, quickly."
He had a pulmonary embolism. You can google it and see what causes them. Blood dripping down his throat from tonsil surgery is not going to cause it.
"Just one thing: ibuprofen is an NSAID, which does thin the blood - but this would make a clot less likely, not more. "
File a police report and hand a copy to the management. Maybe get a surveillance camera.

In response to other comments here I  would like to mention that when I was in a similar situation I was able to move only if I could prove that the schooling I was moving for was not offered in my area. It wasn't. You say she moved for a job but there are similar jobs in your area. I'd immediately contact places to prove that indeed there are jobs in your area similar to what she moved for including similar pay and health benefits. Take that list to your attorney. Good luck with everything. 

Edit spelling"
"It's enough to get the judge to consider awarding you full custody. Whether he/she actually will depends on the totality of the circumstances. For instance, if she needs to move for a job, that would tend to mitigate things."
"Your attorney is a professional, knowledgeable in the law applicable to your state, and familiar both with you and the facts of your case. There is nobody here that can give you better advice. If there are specific things you have questions to, pose those questions to your attorney and don‚Äôt stop asking them until you get sufficient information to answer your questions. "
Thank you for the advice. I'll start on that first thing in the morning!
"Moving for a job is exactly what she's doing. She just graduated from school. But there are several other job opportunities in her field that are within commuting distance of our current location. But she chooses to move 160 miles away. She's young and just wants to live in a ""college"" town. She wants to switch our custody schedule to every other week. Our daughter is supposed to start preschool next month and this won't work with her proposed schedule."
"Thank you. And I've went over all of this with him.. I think I just needed to present it to another source. Looking for some reassurance, I suppose. "
"> Now that the judge has dismissed me once, and since I never have and never plan to have any contact directly or indirectly with these people, it should become progressively easier to get myself dismissed if they ever decided to rile up bullshit like this again, correct?

Did they dismiss you with or without prejudice?

Are you asking about getting yourself dismissed from the same lawsuit or future different lawsuits?"

"Any injury on the job is covered by worker's compensation. Whomever your boss had you speak with was only looking out for the company's interests, not yours. 

If you feel you need to go to the doctor, go to the doctor. Ask them to note that this occurred on the job"
That nurse is reaaallly putting herself at risk advising you like that over the phone. I'm a nurse and absolutely without question woukd not say the words 'you don't need to see a professional' because 1. I can't tell over the phone and 2. If you did and I advised incorrectly and things went to shit I could be held liable professionally and maybe legally (latter part I'm not 100% sure of but I'm sure the folks here are)
It sounds like this nurse is practicing outside the scope of her license.  If you have her name report her to the state board they will discipline her.  If she is not outside the scope she is still in the wrong because she can't see how deep the cut is over the phone.
"I worked for two separate corporations in a field where injuries are not uncommon.  I had three injuries with them and every time, I had to speak with a nurse over the phone before I went in for treatment at a vocational urgent care.  That's just the way the system works for large companies with worker injury procedures in place.  I've also been able to call a nurse for advice through EAP with any place I've worked that is large enough to have an EAP.   I doubt the nurse is putting herself at risk, there are entire companies that contract out to do what she did."
"My health insurance advertises a [24/7 nurse line](https://www.regence.com/web/regence_individual/regence-advice24) that we can call to get more info on whether we need to go to the ER, urgent care, or just schedule a regular appointment. I don't think it's an uncommon thing."

Title: **Update from a couple months ago: Landlords wanting to sue without accepting our offer to pay for any apparent damages and harassing us.**

Original Post: 

> Quick recap: former landlord wanted to sue us because they were mad we left our lease (legally and jumping through every hoop imaginable for them) early. Anyways, quick update. Case didn‚Äôt even make it to court. We had a consultation with a lawyer where we showed him every email and the lack of an itemized list of damages and their lawyer was sent a cease and desist letter, detailing that we had legal grounds for harassment because they went to my college to try to get me kicked out and had to have the dean explain multiple times he won‚Äôt do it and they were threatening a lawsuit prior to us moving out which was seen as financial intimidation to a couple of low income college students. The deal was cease and desist the proceedings and contact or we will file both criminal charges and a financial suit for emotional distress. Our lawyer (who took our case in return for me helping his kid pass his English AP exam and my husband repairing drywall at his home and is an absolute saint) still has our lawsuit and criminal charges ready to file if they ever contact us again. The advice we got here helped as well.

"IANAL, but my gut says this is super illegal. But regardless, this is at best very bad hiring practice. You do not want to work for a company that would expect this of you. "
"I believe an interview is a 2 way street.  They are asking you to work 3 days without pay.  That is what they are demonstrating.  So you get the job and they ask you to ""volunteer"" over the weekend.  No complaints."
"Legal or not, a company this disrespectful of potential employees isn't one you want to work for. This is lucky, honestly - a bad employer showed you their true colors before you moved to take a position."
I can‚Äôt believe employers still do these. Are you going through a temp agency? 
"An employer is allowed to do a ""skills assessment.""  Basically give you a task and ask how you would do it or have you talk through the process.  This would be a sample of their regular business.

If they are asking you to do regular work then you are an employee and need to be paid for the time spent working."
"In terms of just the legality, this is likely totally legal, because as a non-profit company (as opposed to a for profit company) they can simply claim that you were a ""volunteer"" for 3 days - BEFORE THEY AGREED TO HIRE YOU AS AN EMPLOYEE.

EDIT:  For discussions about non-profits and internships for volunteers vs. employees, you can start with the link below.  Some of the issues that apply to ""internships"" would also apply to ""working interviews"".

https://www.councilofnonprofits.org/tools-resources/interns-employee-or-volunteer

"
"You must be paid for time worked outside of a reasonable time for an interview.

You can file a wage claim with the Dept of Labor in your state for time worked. The bad news is you‚Äôll only receive minimum wage for your hours worked. Personally, if it was me and I didn‚Äôt get the job, I‚Äôd file the wage claim out of principal alone. At the very least, it should stop them from continuing to implement that shitty practice in the future."
"What kind of work are they asking you to do? Data entry perhaps?

"
"NAL. 

You do the work, and then you get paid.  Three days is not an interview; it's a very short probationary period, and they may be doing this to get around having to hire temps.  I would avoid this organization."
"Everything about this screams I don‚Äôt work for free.  They would be paying my transport, taking me out to meals, and putting me up in a NICE hotel.  Again, I don‚Äôt work for free.  "
Thanks for the reply! I'm disappointed but I agree. Seems super inconsiderate if nothing else. 
"I agree, this feels very one-way. Thank you for your help!"
"I was really excited about the opportunity but the more I think about it the more I agree with you.. if not illegal, then pretty unethical. Thanks for the reply! "
"I'm not - just a regular application and interview through the organization itself. I was surprised too, had never even heard of a working interview before! "
"Thanks for your answer! Unfortunately they haven't given me details about what I'd be doing, but based on the job description and the reviews I've read, it looks like more than a skills assessment. And three full days seems like so much! "
[deleted]
"This is true if the OP was talking about a for profit company.  But the OP was talking about a non-profit company.  A non-profit company can ask a prospective employee to volunteer for some period of time, so they can see if they would make a good employee or not.  Note the volunteer.  Now I am going to assume that technically speaking, the prospective employee / volunteer would have to do the same kind of work as what other volunteers do, not the work of what other employees do."
"If they contacted OP and said ""we'd like you to come volunteer for three days, and if we like your work, we may offer you a job"", then yes; but offering OP a job, not paying, and then later saying ""they were a volunteer?"" That will make things worse for them, not better."
Thanks for the answer! This is helpful to know. As long as it's legal I can just think about how ethical it is (or isn't...). 
"They haven't told me yet but based on the job I applied for and the Glassdoor reviews I read, I assume it would be mostly research and writing. "
"And regardless of whether it‚Äôs illegal or not, it‚Äôs immoral and not practices of a company I would want to work for.

I‚Äôm in jewelry and when hiring, we administer a test which requires the applicant to complete a few different jobs with the intention of determining whether or not they‚Äôre qualified to work for us. This test usually takes a couple hours depending on the applicant but certainly no more than four. Does this non-profit require specific skilled labor that would take multiple days to determine if you are capable of doing the work?"
They aren't asking OP to volunteer.  They are contemplating hiring OP and asking him to work for free for 3 days.
Non profits don't have to follow a different set of laws just because they do not attempt to turn a profit.
"But they didn't ask OP to do that; they asked OP to come in for a ""working interview"". Wording is important."
I agree.
"It‚Äôs a grey area, can they not have him volunteer due to being a non profit? It seems as though most of the DOL language is concerning For Profit businesses. "
"Non-profit companies have to follow MANY different rules than for-profit companies, and MANY rules that for-profit companies have to follow do not apply to non-profit companies.  If you don't understand that, then you should look into the MANY differences between non-profit companies and for-profit companies."
This is what the OP is telling us that they were told.  But it's more likely that things will be spelled out slightly differently when the OP actually signs something to begin working as a volunteer for 3 days.
"It's not a grey area.

The employer *could* only hire from a pool of volunteers and make it clear that potential employees need to volunteer to be considered.

What they *cannot* do is make employment contingent on OP ""volunteering."""
"Those laws are largely related to reporting income and taxes, not to employment."
This is the reason I can‚Äôt believe employers do this. 
"Thank you again for all the advice!! I really appreciate your time. Just to clarify - how would I distinguish between these two? If I tell them I can't afford to miss three days of work to ""volunteer"" with them in hopes of getting a job (and nothing about volunteering/working interviews was mentioned in the application or up to this point), does this mean they're allowed to automatically rule me out?"
"We aren't talking about ""employment"" here, because the OP is not an employee of the non-profit.  The OP could possibly become a volunteer at the non-profit for a few days PRIOR to being extended a job offer.  That would not be illegal.  To understand more, you can start learning at the following link:

https://www.councilofnonprofits.org/tools-resources/interns-employee-or-volunteer

"You must not hang out here a lot.  Employers do all sorts of stupid illegal stuff.

""You're going to work for free for a week to learn a lesson.""

""We're not going to give you your 401(k) after you quit.""

""Work at this different location so you don't earn overtime.""

""Employees are paid on scheduled hours, not actual time worked."""
"You can work for them for 3 days, demand payment, and if they refuse to pay you file a dispute with your local department of 

I'd wait to file the dispute until after they choose to hire you or not.  If you're hired and they fire you for asking to be paid for the time worked you can also hit them with a retaliation claim.

You can also not work for free and report them to the DoL for illegal hiring practices.  The DoL may or may not act."
"But they didn't offer him a volunteer position, did they? They framed it as a part of the interview process for employment."
"Relatively new to Reddit all together, I will say what I‚Äôve seen from you on here is usually spot on. After a little research you are again correct like usual. "
"THEY DID NOT FRAME IT THAT WAY, THE OP FRAMED IT THAT WAY.  How much do you want to bet that if the OP went there he would have to sign a document stating that he was a volunteer and that his consideration for employment was not contingent upon being a volunteer."
"Don't forget ""Employer taking your tips."" and ""Employer is deducting broken X from my paycheck."" for a couple of additional greatest hits of /r/legaladvice."
">and that his consideration for employment was not contingent upon being a volunteer.

If his consideration for employment was not contingent on being a volunteer then why would they‚Äôd require him to volunteer for three days as a condition of employment. Something doesn‚Äôt make sense here. "
"My bet is that they never said that volunteering for 3 days was a REQUIREMENT for consideration of employment.  My bet is that they simply said that they would LIKE him to come in for 3 days as a volunteer so that they could better evaluate him, that it would help them, and that it would make him a better candidate, etcetera.  But my bet is that at some point they have him sign a document that says he is volunteering - and that doing so is NOT a requirement for future employment.  

Of course they could simply be morons who don't know the law, or they simply might not care, because nobody is going to be suing them individually for this, and nobody is going to be filing a class action case against them for this either.  It's usually more of a problem for unpaid summer internships - where people spend months as ""volunteers"" but doing the work of an employee and/or getting paid less than minimum wage - leading to the question of if they were volunteers or employees.  But in that situation at least it amounts to money worth suing over."
"Yeah, that's not good, and I wouldn't be surprised if code enforcement would be interested in hearing about it. Also I wouldn't park your car there for fear of it getting towed. "
"This isn't quite as clear-cut as it might appear at first.   The disabled parking spots at your building [might be covered by ADA or by FHA](https://www.myparkingsign.com/blog/fha-ada-apartment-building-disabled-parking-rights/), and small townhome developments might be exempt.

What is more clear is that you would come out on the losing end;   if a parking spot is marked for disabled use, then parking in it is a violation no matter who owns the property.

None of this should come as a surprise to a developer.   


The solution might be to negotiate a rebate because they cannot provide a feature that you paid for, or to have the developer remove some of the disabled parking signage if the building is in fact exempt."
I think your SO should talk to his lawyer about this. 
"Honestly, this never occurred to me. These issues had been sorted as two totally different things in my brain that it never clicked we can talk to the lawyer. 

I know this comment comes across as sarcastic, but thank you for pointing that out."
Glad I could help. 
"This almost certainly isn't a wage claim situation. You need to sue them, and as you guessed, you likely need to do it in Texas. "
"They paid you residuals and filed a W2?  Are you sure it wasn't a form 1099?

A form W2 is usually for active work as an employee.  If you didn't work any hours for an employer in 2015 or 2016, they shouldn't be sending a W2.  If it is a W2 and not a 1099, it's probably an invalid W2."
"Thank you for the guidance. Google is telling me that the statue of limitations for small claims in Texas is 2 years, but that   ‚ÄúThe statute of limitations, however is what the law calls an ‚Äúaffirmative defense,‚Äù and if the person you sue does not raise it, it will be waived.‚Äù

Should I be concerned about the defendant raising this given that I was just made aware about this non-payment a month ago, although payment was due as far back as 2015?

Thanks again!"
"Hi Kevin, thanks for pointing that out. I just double checked both the letter from the IRS and the documents I was able to get from the production company- IRS refers to a W2 and that is what was sent to me by the production company once I dug in. I will call the production company tomorrow regarding this issue. Can you help me understand what implications this could have?

*edit words"
"Generally sol begins from the date the offense is discovered, not necessarily when it takes place."
"You need a lawyer from TX who can answer the SOL problem, and also you have damages in excess of the amount owed; potential IRS penalties, etc. It may not be a 'small claims' issue given all of that."
"This is a reminder that how any of us *feel* about legal abortions is off topic here.  Stick to the law as it is, and not how you wish it was.

And on that same line of reasoning, just sending moral support to OP is also off topic.  This is a legal advice sub, so we're going to keep it on topic...

Ok?

Ok."
"Spousal consent isn‚Äôt required in any state, such laws have been found to be unconstitutional.  The source of the money is irrelevant, do what you must do for you with regards to the pregnancy.  Also, you cannot kidnap a fetus.  Your husband is demonstrating classic controlling and manipulative practices and you should not be taking legal advice from him.  On Monday start talking to divorce attorneys."
">he said he will not give his permission to have an abortion and it is fraud for me to get one without him.¬†

This is 100% completely untrue. You are legally able to get an abortion without his consent. It is not fraud, and there's legally nothing he can do to stop you.

>If I try to leave he will have me arrested for kidnapping.¬†

No, he won't. This is not kidnapping by any stretch of the imagination. Police will not arrest you.

>I cannot use any of the money in the bank for this because they are joint accounts and I do not have my husband's permission.¬†

This is also untrue. Those accounts are joint, legally speaking you both have permission to use it. If he told you that you need hos permission to use any of that money he has lied to you.

>Is my account with my mom also marital property that I could get in trouble for using without his permission?

You will not get in trouble for using that money. Absolutely zero trouble. Use it today to buy a bus ticket anywhere you want to go. Seriously, leave today if you can.

>How likely is it that I will get in trouble if I go to NH (where my parents live) from KY (where I live now) and lie and say I don't know who the father is so I can get an abortion? I know it may be illegal but I am willing to risk it I can't handle another pregnancy.

Zero percent likely. You have rights to travel even while pregnant. Married women do not need their husband's permission to travel or to get an abortion.


You need to leave as soon as you can. Like, today with just your absolute essentials. Your husband appears to be an extremely controlling person who has severely lied to you about what your own rights are. I fear he could be violent if he finds out, so please, buy a bus ticket or get in the car and drive to your parents' house today."
Your husband has no say in whether or not you get an abortion; you don't need his permission and he can't legally prevent it
"You can leave without his permission

You can use money in a joint account without his permission (don't take it all, that's generally frowned on by judges, but reasonable use - even for running away, and an abortion is allowed) (IANAL, but this is what I've been told)

You can have an abortion without his permission. 

Please get out, get the abortion you want, get divorced.

I don't mean to sound harsh, but it sounds like you are unaware of the rights you have as a human. Just because you married someone does not give them control over your thoughts, decisions, and actions. I highly recommend finding a therapist who can help you recognize your own rights and teach you about healthy relationships.
"
"You can use any money in joint accounts. They are joint. You don't need his permission. Nor his permission to get an abortion. 

So leave. And then talk to an attorney to file for divorce"
"Your husband is being financially abusive if you believe you can't legally use any money in your joint accounts without his permission.  Abusive people convince their victims of all sorts of things that just aren't true we can't guess all of the things he has deceived you about.

Try here also for more questions and exit strategies or just strategies to get an abortion without your spouse knowing.  Among other things inform Drs in written they are not to discuss your medical history with your spouse. 

http://www.thehotline.org/blog/get-help-today/

Not legal advice it may be best if you are surrounded by people you trust and will protect you from your spouse before you take any noticable action.  So husband doesn't apply pressure to you or harm you. "
"Get your stuff and leave. If you think he‚Äôs going to try to stop you get off Reddit, call the police, and tell them this. 

You can deal with the rest later. Get away and get yourself safe. "
"Your husband is full of crap, and you shouldn‚Äôt believe anything he tells you. 

Your husband has no claim at all on the joint account with your mother. You can use the money in your joint accounts with your husband, but a judge would look poorly on it if you completely drained them. You could safely withdraw about half.

You have the right to travel anywhere you like regardless of whether you‚Äôre carrying a fetus, and your husband has no say in whether or not you receive an abortion anywhere in the US. This isn‚Äôt the Handmaid‚Äôs Tale.

Get out, and good luck."
"> when I told him I don't want to be pregnant he said he will not give his permission to have an abortion

To my knowledge no state requires spousal permission.  Some states will notify though.

> If I try to leave he will have me arrested for kidnapping.

LOL!  That's not a thing.

1.  You don't need his permission to use any marital funds.  They are yours... do as you please.

2. You don't need to lie.  Spousal consent isn't required."
"You don't need to discuss why you're getting an abortion at the clinic. Yes, you can get one anytime you want without needing anyone's permission. It's your body, your decision. 


Joint account means you own the money in there as much as he does. You can use that money any way you please. This is another area you don't need your husband's permission  or approval on how to use said money."
"**You do not, under any circumstances, need anyone's permission to get an abortion. Not your husband's, not your parents, no one!**

This is the link for Planned Parenthood:

https://www.plannedparenthood.org/

They will help you obtain treatment. They will likely do it for a reduced cost, or even for free. "
"OP, please, please be careful. Please call a women's shelter to get advice on leaving safely and covering your tracks. You can also call the police non-emergency number and ask for an escort as you pack your things. Statistically, an abusive partner is most likely to turn to violence when you attempt to leave. Additionally, being pregnant multiplies the chances of you dying at the hands of your partner. Be safe and don't take any chances. 

You're doing the right thing. Stay strong."
"Abort your pregnancy, then your marriage. "
"Honey I live in Kentucky and your husband is so full of crap. Call your momma, have her pick you and your things up, stop at the bank where the marital joint account is, withdraw 50%, and GTFO outta here."
"You sound like you are in a abusive relationship. Walk out the door and keep going until you get somewhere safe. Then follow the rest of the advice in this thread.
"
"Take your id and some clothes & necessities. Go to the bank and take half the money; it's yours. Legally you can remove all the money, but half of it is his and a court would likely order you to return his share. 

Go to a DIFFERENT bank entirely to open an account in your name only. Keep enough cash for your abortion and living expenses for a couple weeks. NEVER tell anyone about that account, not even your parents. Then go to your parents' home. Get your abortion if that's what you want, and get a divorce lawyer. Also therapy. 

Wishing you the very best as you take your next steps as a free woman."
"Your husband is lying to you and manipulating you.  

The funds in the joint account that you have with your husband can be withdrawn by either of you *without* the other spouse's permission. You can walk into the bank, or go to the ATM, and take every last dime out of that account and there is nothing that your husband can do about it. Given the way that he has treated you, I would say take the money and run. 

Also, you do not need his permission to have an abortion. 

Based on the threats that he has made, you could easily get a restraining order which would require him to leave your home. If he attempts to return, you can have him arrested for violating the order. This would allow you to remain in the home and get some much needed ""rest"" from him and his antics. "
"1. Joint accounts mean that you have legal access to them. If you do want to divorce I would try not to use more than 50% that's in there since those accounts would usually be split 50/50 between you two. 
2. You do not need spousal permission to go through an abortion. It's your body and it's your health. 
3. If he's threatening kidnapping because of your being pregnant he doesn't have a leg to stand on. He can't get you arrested for leaving him, even if you're pregnant. 
4. He sounds like a very controlling person and I would perhaps look into therapy for yourself. I obviously don't know the full story but it sounds like he at the very least mentally/emotionally abuses you. Everything you've said so far in your post is very alarming and his behavior is -- unusual to say the least. 

Edit: Misunderstood something, fixed part of my advice as a result. "
"OP, just a word on withdrawing money. Withdraw from your joint account on your way out of town. Don't take out the money before you leave.  

I have another alert on my account from transactions over a certain amount so I can check for fraud. It wouldn't surprise me if your husband has the same alert set to monitor your usage. "
"What the actual \*FUCK\*?! I'm sorry, but you don't need his permission for a damn thing, and whoever told you that you did is a fucking liar. Also, since the unborn child isn't legally a person yet, you can't be charged with kidnapping. I've never heard of anyone getting charged with fraud for having an abortion, either, but keep in mind that IANAL.

Also, that joint account with your husband? You don't need his permission to access it any more than he needs your permission. Check the current balance, cut it in half. That's yours, and fuck him and his ""permission"". Talk to a divorce lawyer, and a psychiatrist, because he's got you on a mental leash.

TL;DR - PERMISSION NOT NEEDED, GET OUT NOW AND TAKE WHAT YOU NEED\* TO DO SO

\*can't empty the account, but you can't be denied access to it for living expense. For example, travel/lodging/food to get somewhere safe and to get an attorney. DO IT. Also, apologies for the cursing, this hit a nerve. All curses are directed towards him.

EDIT: just saw your comment to someone else that you are leaving. GOOD! Don't look back, don't second guess, and whatever you do, DO NOT TALK TO HIM. He will tell you whatever he thinks you need to hear to get you back, whether it be (false) promises, (vain) threats of legal action, or (serious) threats of violence. I don't know him, so I don't know \*how\* he'll snap, but from what you've said about him, I'd bet my bottom dollar that he \*will\* snap in some way. Don't you dare stop until you are safe with your parents. "
"1. Whether that account is marital property is a complicated and fact sensitive issue. When was the account opened? What was it used for? What funds were deposited? Just to name a few very important questions. 

Edit to clarify that if your name is on the account, you can use it, as others have said. 

2. I am not aware of any law in NH requiring your husbands consent for an abortion.  I am also unaware of such a requirement in KY. So you don't have to lie about that.  "
"You don't need anyone's permission to get an abortion, it is completely up to you to choose whether you want to carry a child to term.  It's possible you got bad advice from someone (your husband), or you accidentally called one of those right to life places posing as an abortion center.  

It sounds like your husband is abusive and controlling.  You should secure your important documents (birth certificates, passports, social security cards) for yourself and your children and go to your parents."
"\>  he said he will not give his permission to have an abortion and it is fraud for me to get one without him.

Are you in the US? ID so what he said is a pack of lies. Roe v Wade still is the law of the land and the Handmaiden's Tale is not reality tv."
"Something to consider: did your husband know that you didn‚Äôt want to be pregnant? Does he know you want to leave?

Is it possible that he messed with your birth control/condoms in an attempt to make you stay?"
"If he is telling you that you need his permission to terminate any pregnancy or withdraw any money from a joint account, he is just trying to control you. If you really want out, take as mush money as you need to get to your parents and to terminate the pregnancy. Find out how much of a retainer a lawyer would need for a divorce and withdraw it from the joint account (or at lease enough for a retainer) then file."
">I cannot use any of the money in the bank for this because they are joint accounts and I do not have my husband's permission.

If your name is on the accounts, then you can withdraw from them. He doesn't need to be present at the bank when you withdraw.

>How likely is it that I will get in trouble if I go to NH (where my parents live) from KY (where I live now) and lie and say I don't know who the father is so I can get an abortion?

You will not get in any trouble. You do not need the father's permission to have an abortion.

>If I try to leave he will have me arrested for kidnapping.

Kidnapping who? He's just trying to scare you. You're an adult and you can travel wherever you please.

Hurry up and get it done before the 10 week mark though, because before 10 weeks you can get a medical abortion (the one where you take 2 pills and the fetus evacuates). After 10 weeks you'd need a surgical abortion."
"Everything hes saying to you is nonsense to just control you. You do not need his permission for anything, nor could you get arrested for kidnapping."
"IANAL but do not tell your husband you plan to leave him- abuserS can become dangerous at that time.  Call the national domestic violence hotline for help


Stay safe and good luck OP"
"I hope you are doing ok with all of this. 


The bank would have to let you take money out of the joint account as it belongs to both of you. 


I am going to let others answer the second question for you.

"
"I agree with all the other posts.  You can use the money that you need and you can also get an abortion...it has nothing to do with him.  One thing I will advise you though, be very careful to avoid crisis pregnancy centers...they mimic abortion providers but they do not offer abortions and will use any private information you provide against you.  So wherever you go, don't mention your stbx husband or your situation...just in case.  But make sure you go to a place that actually provides abortions.  Good luck...it really sounds like you're doing the right thing in getting out of there.  I'm glad you have parents that are helping you."
"1) You can use money in a joint account without the permission of the other party. 

2) You seem to have already made up your mind regardless of legality."
"You can use money in an account with your name on it, and you do not need the father's permission to have an abortion.  The father has *zero* rights to the fetus until it is born, *if* it is born.  So go get it done and then file for divorce."

"How would it be 'fraud' to get an abortion without his permission?

You don't need it. It's up to you.

You are 100% legally entitled to take what's in any joint account.

Take what you need, and run like the wind."
"I worry it may be prudent to point out that your husband has no right to your body, period.  Your husband cannot force you into sexual acts, though I pray that isn't relevant to you."
"Can i say specifically that even if your husband earned all of that money, half of it is yours. Take 1/2 out of that account. Leave the other half. "

"If you are not going to take any money from the joint accounts then at least get a statement of the current balance. Go into a branch with your cards and ID and request one. This could be very useful if you opt to divorce and would help a judge to establish any money held by the two of you. It would also help if he later hides any money.

I am not a lawyer, nor am I American so I'm not certain what would need to happen for these statements to be accepted as evidence further down the line (ie notarized etc) so perhaps a lawyer could help out here? "
"OP, please listen to the others who have posted and get out as soon as possible!  There's no way a guy like your husband who is so controlling won't freak out if he thinks you're leaving.  Leave, and do it quietly, but do it quick and stay away from him!"

"The money in the joint account with your husband is perfectly legal for you to access. He has NO rights to the money in the joint account with your mother. You do NOT need his permission to get an abortion, and even if the baby were already born there's no such thing as a parent being arrested for kidnapping their own child unless there is a custody order in place (custody order can't be issued until after a child is born).

Your husband is exhibiting classic abusive behaviour. Get your ID documents and get to a women's shelter NOW! If possible, take out half the money from the joint account. The shelter should have resources to help you make further arrangements (lawyers, ensuring your phone is cleaned of trackers/spyware, access to abortion). Don't know about any shelters? National Domestic Violence Hotline is (800)799-SAFE.

Quick web search shows Kentucky is one of the most restrictive states regarding abortion (limits starting as early as 11 weeks, ban after 20), New Hampshire is very liberal (no waiting period, no maximum on gestation).

Your abuser is in Kentucky, your support system is in New Hampshire. Head out there, and abort, carry to term (indicate father unknown) and surrender the baby under the safe haven law (up to 7 days after birth, at any hospital, police station, or specific other locations), or raise it as a single mother.

You do not need a reason, valid or not, to have an abortion.

You cannot kidnap your own child.  You can leave with your kid and go wherever you please, but so can he.  You need a divorce and court ordered custody.

You have rights to half of all you and your husband owns, including half the money in your shared bank account.

Find a family lawyer and get somewhere safe with your child."
" Just a random question unrelated to OP. Does the Father in general have any say in whether or not to abort a child(if a Father does not want it but Mother does), or does the Mother only get to choose? Also, what about adoption rights(who can choose to put up)? Just curious questions, sorry to bother you."

"I don't think this is great advice. Restraining orders are not generally ""easy"" to get (IDK about OP's state but in many places they require a documented police interaction to have occurred already with the restrained party and/or involve a hearing to even be issued in some cases) and they're a kind of escalation because they provoke anger from abusers. It's not like the house gets a magic spell on it that will arrest him the moment he returns. OP needs to get somewhere that her abuser won't be able to find her. Laws and orders and arrests are great tools but they're not actually real protections from immediate and possibly violent acts. ETA: We also don't even know if the husband has perpetrated anything specific enough for the local jurisdiction's laws to even be considered for a restraining order."

"> If I try to leave he will have me arrested for kidnapping.

In the context of her now being pregnant.  Based on the information provided, the husband is absolutely claiming it would be kidnapping if she leaves."
The concept of kidnaping a fetus in your own body is so bizarre I think the poster assumed children were present.
"It depends on the state in adoption situations. Some states require that the father is located and personally asked to consent. Others only allow him to consent if he‚Äôs jumped through hoops to be allowed to. Look up ‚Äúputative father registries.‚Äù Fascinating and disturbing stuff. A colleague did her dissertation on this. 

Some unethical infant adoption agencies encourage expectant mothers to give birth in states with few laws protecting fathers and/or to lie and say father is unknown. There has been a push to recognize the state where the family actually lives as the jurisdiction rather than the state where the adoption agency flew the mother to avoid laws. "
"Which is why, for the ""safe haven"" option, I said to list the father as unknown on the birth certificate."
"I hope I'm right, because this will be a lot simpler if there are no current children."
"AFAIK, there is pretty much one clinic that performs late-term abortions, and it‚Äôs in Colorado. It‚Äôs something like $10,000 cash. I used to work in a developmental clinic, and this is where our affiliated prenatal specialists sent people for situations where a chromosomal anomaly incompatible with life is discovered late. Well, the few families who can fly there and have savings or a credit card are sent there. The others give birth to a dead or dying baby. Pisses me off that they can‚Äôt all just resolve it in the dignified manner of their choice in a clinic near home with their insurance covering it. "
"ATMs usually have withdrawal limits around $400 and many bank accounts have daily withdrawal limits. 

Since OP mentioned having a joint bank account with her mother, I would write a check from the joint spousal account and cash it into the account with the mother."
"Not OP, but I appreciate how helpful you are :)"

That was all well-said, but this part is especially well-said. It's something that I think a great majority of victims don't truly grasp until it's pointed out to them this clearly, even though many may have started to realize it less clearly by the time they recognize they're being abused."
"Whoops, typo, I agree."
I think they read the part about it being OP's second pregnancy and missed the fact that the first ended in a miscarriage
I think you are. I reread and am now wondering how I initially thought there was a child involved. I guess that's what I get for reading reddit before being fully awake.
Yikes.   I thought it would be relatively common to abort a pregnancy that was clearly not going to survive.     Even at late term.      
"A bank account usually does not have a withdrawal limit. As long as she's listed as a joint on the account she should legally have access to every penny of her funds.

OP if you are reading this, withdraw the necessary funds in form of cash, and then deposit the funds to a new account. If you do an electronic transfer or use cheque your husband can track the funds himself.

"
"The limit can be raised for a day by calling the bank in most cases. This is to protect from unauthorized draws, but I have pulled moneyfor a car a few times by calling ahead and getting a limit increase."
Been there. Thank the gods for caffeine.
"There's a great documentary called *After Tiller*, about that one clinic in Colorado and the four doctors who perform late-term abortions. They're the only ones in the US, and they live under constant threat from the same type of religious nutters who murdered Dr. Tiller. It's an amazing, tragic film."
It's common to want to. Being able to access the care is a very different question.
"OP, if you are reading this, withdraw cash and depoait it in a new separate bank account in your own name *at a different bank.* (Not a different branch; a different bank entirely.) Preferably one that's conveniently located where your mother lives. And don't disclose any information about the account to your husband except through your lawyer, once you have one. 

(Abusers have been known to use social engineering tactics to gain access to their victims' separate bank accounts, and your husband sounds like the type to try. This would be illegal, and any bank employee who allowed it would be negligent, but it happens.)"
You might have to go into the bank rather than to the machine. Above poster was just saying the machine might have a limit
"Depending on how much she is looking to withdraw at once, there could be some issues with a large cash withdrawal. The ATM limit is definitely a factor, but bank tellers are also trained to keep an eye out for large, unusual cash withdrawals. 

While all money in an account is yours to use and access, needing more than a couple thousand cash at once will definitely raise some eyebrows. It is not unusual to be asked details about why so much is needed, and why you would not prefer a safer form, like a cashiers check. The bank is in charge of protecting that money, and watching for odd behavior is part of that. 

Tellers are also trained to watch for elderly financial abuse (FEEVA). Just a fun fact. "
"If OP were to get money from a teller it would be advisable to say the cash is for a car or some other use, some people are very against abortion in KY and other southern states."
"You are correct to an extent,

But cash withdrawals over 10,000.00 and a penny are the only ones that will automatically start a CTR. The bank legally has to notify OP that they are creating a CTR report.

Any other cash transaction can also create red flags and the employees may create an SAR but they are not legally allowed to share that fact with OP.

To my knowledge there are no actual limits on how much cash a person can withdraw from an account, besides physical limits, i.e the bank does not have the actual cash on hand.

"If you hire an attorney the odds you can challenge the second ticket via challenging the wait time of the first under Gonzalez v US (2015) are much higher than if you go at it alone. If you go at it alone I‚Äôd peg it at a zero percent chance (because you still have license restrictions). 
 
It‚Äôs probably something an attorney can get knocked down to a non-moving violation/civil citation. 
 
Edit: It‚Äôs Rodriguez not Gonzalez"
"You probably technically violated the law, and probably technically have no defense. That said, judges are not robots, and you might have a chance at a reduced fine or dismissal. 

Unless you can prove the cop was lying about smelling pot, making you wait for the dog is probably going to stand.  As u/KingKidd said,  [Rodriguez  ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodriguez_v._United_States)says police cannot detain you for longer than needed for a traffic stop to wait for a dog, unless they have further reasonable suspicion you're doing something illegal.

I would certainly at least talk to a traffic attorney. See if they have any recommendation of any other professional to talk about regarding a potential Rodriguez violation. Cops have been stupid enough to admit to fabricating reasonable suspicion on their dash cams, so you never know."
"If the officer had found anything illegal, I would definitely lawyer up and use the Rodriguez case. However since you didn‚Äôt have anything and only got tickets for the curfew, those are the only worry. 

It‚Äôs tricky because going in without a lawyer, it‚Äôll be harder to get out of the tickets. You should try talking to the police department and see if there is some sort of incident record for the first encounter. If you can get something that has the exact times for when the first officer pulled you over/let you go and also have a printout of directions that show how far it is to your house (so you can prove that you would have gotten home in time if not for the first traffic stop). You‚Äôd have a pretty good shit going it alone. 

If you get a lawyer, it‚Äôll probably be easier to get out of the tickets but then you‚Äôd have to weigh the costs of a 600$ ticket and the cost of the lawyer. 

I would plead not guilty either way (they usually make deals without even asking for one). Check and see if there are additional penalties for getting a ticket while having a limited DL. Because sometimes there is a penalty like having to wait until 21 to get your full license. 

If by the end of this, you determine there is very large stakes and losing is going to be harsh ($600 fine plus license suspension). Lawyer is probably best route. If the only risk is the money, I‚Äôd say try doing all the preparation listed above and just going for it yourself. At worst, you have to pay the fine. At best, you can either get the charges dropped, reduced, or get a freebie deal from the DA"
"Depending on your city the process might be helpful. 

Typically you will go to court for your ticket and prior to the case you‚Äôll meet the prosecutor who will go over  your case and probably over a plea deal. Talk with them about the facts:

- You were pulled over at 930 on your way home.

- You because of the time it took to investigate your car you were held past curfew by a police officer. 

- Had you not been held for that period of time you wouldn‚Äôt have broken curfew. 

The prosecutor might offer an even lower plea deal at this point or you may have to ask that he/she/xim/xer drop the charges all together. 

If they offer a plea it‚Äôs up to you if you want to take it. But if you decide not to you can request a trial at a different date in order to have time to prepare a defense/get a lawyer. 

You can get a one hour consult with lawyers by calling them and you‚Äôll get some helpful info. Find out how much they will charge for your defense. It may not be worth it if you get offered a plea for a very small amount. But at least you‚Äôll have the info to decide if you should take the plea or not. 

"
"Hey here's a question. Why did the second cop pull you over? Did you commit another traffic violation? Do you look particularly young, and were you in a well-lit area?"
"> Do I need to get a lawyer? What are the odds I can get out of these tickets? Is it worth it? Is that even a reasonable legal defense to be out past curfew.

I don't know that you HAVE to get a lawyer, but it sure wouldn't hurt, and in your shoes I would because I'd be so pissed. However, it's possible the fines are less than the cost of a lawyer."
"NAL, but wouldn't this be an actual case of entrapment?  "

Title: **(ID) I got a Curfew and driving past my liscense allows tickets because I was pulled over, and officer said they had to wait 25 minutes for a k9 unit to arrive.**

Original Post: 

> So I'm a minor, and my liscense has a restriction that says I can't drive past 10:00 PM. There is also a curfew in my city for 10:30. Full disclosure, I was doing 10 over in a 60. Cop pulled me over, told me what I was doing wrong, I was apologetic. He said my car smelled like marijuana and he wanted to get a k9 unit over to check. I have never had marijuana in my car, and I honestly think this was complete BS.  I was about 20 minutes away from home and it was 9:35 when I was pulled over. By the time the k9 unit gets there it's was 9:50. k9 finds no weed of course so the cop went back into his car. He came out and told me he was gonna let me off with a warning this time.
> 
> All was good and well, until I got to my neighborhood about 3 minutes away from home at exactly 10:30. Litterally one block away from home a different cop pulls me over. He told me to get out of the car, asks for my liscense. After he looked at it he violently put handcuffs on me. He made me get in the back of his car. He drove me home, knocked on the door, had a chat with my dad, now I have a 200 and 400 dollar ticket, one for curfew, and one for going against my liscense restrictions.
> 
> Neither of these tickets would have happened if I wasn't pulled over originally by the first cop. I have a court date. Do I need to get a lawyer? What are the odds I can get out of these tickets? Is it worth it? Is that even a reasonable legal defense to be out past curfew.

What about Rodriguez v US?

https://www.dennisdwyerlaw.com/new-limits-on-police-power-traffic-stops-cannot-be-prolonged"
"Unfortunately, the cop said he smelled the pot before calling for the dog, so there probably was ""independently supported reasonable suspicion"", as RBG put it in Rodriquez. Obviously, given that there was no pot, that's not all that likely, but you know how that goes. "
"I‚Äôm a civil lawyer, but I have worked in two different prosecutors offices and have handled a lot of traffic offenses for friends.

You probably don‚Äôt need a lawyer, at least for your first hearing. You will have an opportunity to talk to the prosecutor, explain the situation, and be offered a deal. If you can get the citations reduced to no points and just a fine, you‚Äôre better off doing that than retaining a lawyer. This would resolve the situation to a certainty for probably less money than you would spend gambling on a lawyer to fight it. Even if you win, you‚Äôll end up out more money.

Definitely call around and ask how much representation would cost, though. That way, if the prosecutor won‚Äôt work with you, you‚Äôll know whether you want to hire a lawyer or not. The judge will end up adjourning the hearing for at least a couple weeks to let you retain representation. "
"If the K9 search showed there was no weed, can't you say the cop clearly couldn't have smelled weed since it wasn't present?"
The second one. The cops around here pull bassically anyone over on suspicion of curfew violation. If your out past 10:30 and don't look old you are probably getting pulled over. also they hand those $200 dollar tickets out like they are fucking candy. Also the fact that I was near a very popular weed smoking spot didn't help.
"...oops, that‚Äôs the one. "
Reasonable suspicion is the key here imho.
"If that distinction meant anything then any policeman can simply say they ‚Äúthought they smelled pot‚Äù in order to get around this issue

If the officer doesn‚Äôt see anything in plain sight and the driver isn‚Äôt exhibiting any signs of being under the influence, the case still stands. They aren‚Äôt allowed to keep you for an unreasonable amount of time while they wait for a K-9 unit to come with no reasonable suspicion. "
If he actually smelled pot why not physically search the vehicle?  Seems to me he just wanted an excuse to get the k9 involved.
"Nah, it could still smell like weed (if someone had hotboxed the car for example)"
"No, but that doesn't matter here anyway.  Whether the first search was reasonable had no evidenciary impact on the second stop."
[removed]
"Is this your guess, or did the officer give some specific explanation?  Was this 2nd officer aware you had been pulled over a half hour prior?  Were the two traffic stops done by the same police department? "
you‚Äôre*
"You're preaching to the choir. The courts get this wrong, and extend extraordinary protections and abilities to police all the time. Their interpretations of their own decisions have gutted the Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Amendments. The reasonable officer standard has been twisted to allow police to be physical dangers to their communities, for example.

Smelling pot may or may not be probable cause, but in a state where it's still totally illegal, it probably is reasonable suspicion"
"Even if the officer falsely claims to have smelled marijuana,  i assume he's unlikely to go so far as to supply and ""find"" his own, so what does he gain by claiming to smell it?"
Smelling the pot is reasonable suspicion for detainment (assuming it was smelled). A dog hit is probable cause to search (even though there's not a lot of evidence that drug sniffing dogs are trained to do what their trainers think they have trained them to do)
[removed]
It could if the cop just wanted to meet a quota. Maybe they just had told another cop to catch that person on their street because they new they couldn‚Äôt make it. Sound extreme but I‚Äôve literally had a cop pull me over just because ‚ÄúI  want to know who‚Äôs in my neighborhood ‚Äú  like he said not all judges are robots and in the same manner not all cops are good guys.

He pulled me over, asked for my liscense, took a look at it. And then he started yelling at me, and told me I was violating curfew. He put me in handcuffs and had me go in the back of his car. He asked me where my home is and I told him it was the next right..."

"In a state where it is illegal, the odor of marijuana is 100% probable cause."
"He gets an excuse to search the vehicle and the driver.  

They live by profiling people.  I am not saying this is bad in all cases.  In this case he saw something that made him think that it was highly likely the driver had some kind of illegal drugs.  So he pops the old ""I smell weed"" line and calls for a K9 just to pad his hand a bit.  After the K9 ""hits"" like he has been trained to do, then its like a treasure hunt.  Doesn't matter if they find pills, illegal weapon, a dead body or a trunk full of blow they got you."
There are also K9 trainers who train their dogs to alert on a signal in order to justify a search of a vehicle.  
The odor of marijuana is probable cause to search a vehicle in most states. I have no idea if that's the case for Idaho however.
"I totally agree, but unfortunately that's not how the courts tend to see it. "
Which still wouldn't make this fruit of the poisonous tree...  What time it was is distinct from anything that officer found while searching that car.
Exactly. If the first cop radioed the second they could have set this up.

There are no K9 trainers who profess to do that. There ~~may be~~ almost certainly are some dogs who do actually behave that way."
"Yup! The cop just has to smell MJ. Though, unlike radar guns, the cops nose nor mental health has to undergo calibrations every so often."
So they can search your car.

"Eh... I'd phrase it as there are few if any K9 trainers who attempt to stop the false positives.

Realistically, there's little to no cost to a false positive in these cases, and a large benefit. If I'm running a spam filter, there's a high cost to each false positive and a low cost to each false negative... My economic incentive is to not risk the false positive. I'd rather have a bit of spam than lose important emails. Different areas of the dogs training and responsibilities have different costs and different incentives. If I'm a cop, I'd rather the dog give me a false weed alert than fail to find a suspect or stay where I tell them to."
"Clarification: the cop just has to claim they detected the smell of MJ. 

The reasonable officer standard and related decisions mean the fourth amendment barely exists beyond the threshold of your home."

"This site is specifically set up to avoid being busted/ convicted while carrying. I can't say it's a good source to pull on,  but ill do some looking. "
Good job !
"It's an attempt to prevent police officers from being able to say things like ""I smell marijuana"" every time they want to search your car without a warrant. So to get the warrant or PC they need the dog to indicate on the vehicle. Now of course they can just use a poorly trained dog or have other circumstances generate an indication from the animal but it is at least some sort of attempt at preventing illegal searches from becoming legal searches just because someone says they smell weed, because there isn't a way to determine if the officer smelled weed or not. "
They are scholarly studies that back this up too I believe 
"It's basically the Clever Hans thing going on. Even of the trainer doesn't intend it, the dog will of course appreciate the praise and excitement of their handler when they indicate. So it's kind of a self reinforcing feedback loop."
That's why you train the dog... So it doesn't get a reward for a fake or false signal.

" Whose name was the check in? If it was your wife's name then your MIL committed fraud by cashing it so I would file a police report and a fraud report with the insurance company. If it was in her name, sounds like you'll have to sue mommy for the money. 

You shouldn't have just ignored the non payment letters. You should have called the insurance the day you got the first one. You're going to owe this money. There is no getting around it. And if you have to sue your MIL to get it back, that will take more money.
"
"Do you have a separate attorney from MIL? I suspect the check was issued to her bc it was her primary policy? Your wife and MIL are being sued jointly and severally?  You need your own attorney to point out that mommy dearest got and spent all the money with no knowledge or benefit to your wife. 

In the meantime, you should have an attorney preparing to sue your MIL.  Get your own attorney immediately."

Did she buy a car? If so, she needs to sell the car. Jewelry? Same thing.

Unfortunately, I suspect something a bit worse. She is clearly irresponsible with money. Did she use it to pay off a bunch of credit card debt that existed before the insurance check came? 

"
if the check was issued in your wife's name you may have a cause of action against the bank too
I‚Äôm confused. Why would insurance have sent a check to the mother (or possibly the daughter as she was the patient) and not the doctor directly? Especially for such a large amount?
The tough answer here is that a) you're likely on the hook for the amount charged and b) recovery will consist of a judgement against your mother in law.
The check was in her mother's name as she was the member on the policy.
"If you get your own attorney and sue MIL, expect to owe the lawyer as much or more than the $47,000. We had a simple easement lawsuit and it cost around $45,000. "
Yeah it sounds like get a lawyer to look into this cause the insurance might have fucked up and will need to pay the doctors and then be the ones to sue your mom.
This is why we were so confused and didn't look to much into it. We figured the insurance made a mistake and this is when we tried to go through my MIL since it was her policy.
That's just ridiculous and fearmongering.
"Bullshit, litigation is expensive. I‚Äôve been involved in several lawsuits recently and the amount lawyers charge is INSANELY expensive. $8000 for an order to show cause. $45,000 for a one day easement trial. Anyone who has had to hire lawyers knows that in most cases, litigation is prohibitively expensive. "
That's because you are foolish and hire pointlessly expensive counsel.
That is a ridiculous statement. How could you possibly know any of the details of the lawyers we have hired. These were all different lawyers and we checked multiple lawyers. We went with the cheaper ones. You seem like one of those people who think that anything that comes from their brilliant mind must be true because it came from your mind.
"You first step should be to contact the police department that gave you the receipt, and ask about their process to recover confiscated assets. It's possible they will work with you... but....

This is likely to be an uphill battle. Civil Asset Forfeiture is a big business for many departments. Your cash is long gone, and about the only way you'll get it back is through a trial to prove that it's innocent money. 

Unlike people, property does not enjoy the ""innocent until proven guilty"" standard. You will have to show, somehow, that the money is not in any way related to some kind of illegal activity. Since virtually ALL bills are contaminated with drug residue, all they have to do it test it for cocaine, and it's suddenly drug money. Or they could say it's proceeds of some other crime, indirectly accusing you of whatever and it's up to you to prove they're incorrect. 

An attorney MAY have some success navigating the complexities of this kind of asset recovery, but it won't be cheap. Depending on how much it is, it may or may not be worth the effort. If the lawyer is willing to do it on a contingency great, because something it better than nothing.

This can of course vary by jurisdiction but I don't think there is any state where the government gets to keep the money without presenting any kind of evidence."
"At no point, really; having large quantities of cash alone is not proof that a *person* is guilty of a crime (though it could be evidence which, when combined with other evidence, may collectively prove their guilt beyond a reasonable doubt). However under civil asset forfeiture proceedings, the police can say ""Bro, your honor, we believe this thousands of dollars in cash was involved in criminal activity and is therefore subject to seizure."" and unless the owner of said money can offer sufficient evidence proving otherwise, the money loses, since civil trials generally use the ""preponderance of the evidence"" standard rather than ""reasonable doubt"". "
"They don't have to. The system presumes the money was illegally gained, the police don't have to respond at all. 

Whoever the rightful owner of the money is has to prove that the money is somehow NOT connected to illegal activity. 

Logically it's not possible, and so most large amounts of seized cash never gets returned. If you have $20 in your pocket when you get booked in, that will usually get returned... if you have $2,000 they will assume it's unlawful gains. 

It CAN happen. If you can show that you regularly carry that kind of cash, and aren't otherwise involved in illegal activity and such, but you have to have bank records showing that you regularly cash you pay checks, or routinely withdraw a similar amount of cash from an account that also has provable legal deposits.... things like that.

"If my money can not afford a lawyer, will a lawyer be appointed to my money by the courts?"

"Very unlikely, as these proceedings are usually civil trials rather than criminal; public defenders are generally only available for criminal trials. If you yourself were also being charged with a crime, you might get a public defender for your criminal trial (if you qualify for one), but that lawyer would most likely not be able to assist you with the civil asset forfeiture proceedings in their role as a public defender. "
Could I tie it up by claiming it as evidence in my criminal trial?
"The prosecution would probably be presenting it as evidence themselves anyway, but either way it's only delaying things, and even if you are found innocent in your criminal trial, the civil proceeding against your property can still go ahead and your property can still lose, due to the lower standard of proof required for civil trials.

"I guess the next step would be to take your ID to the DMV, and ask if any vehicles are registered in your name, and go from there. 

Consider locking your credit."
"Credit Karma shows my parent's car when I look under auto.

So yeah, the address is likely the reason it's there. That doesn't totally disprove it isn't registered in your name, but it's a start. Possibly call the DMV and ask directly what vehicles are registered under your name?"
">I was already a little fishy because it was asking stuff about a car during security verification...

 FWIW, that is not fishy in any way. Asking Qs about things that don‚Äôt apply to you works just as well to verify your identity, and such questions are common."
You can go to flhsmv.gov to check for titles and registrations in your name.
"One of the digits in the VIN identifies the model year (from the wiki, 10th digit will be ""P"" for '93 and ""R"" for '95). Also, '93 and '95 Tercels are different ""generations"" - look up the wiki on the car."
My credit karma shows my mom‚Äôs name under auto. 100% sure it‚Äôs because my old car was registered under her address and hers was as well. It gives me an option to delete it.
Does it show that the car is financed or just registered?
[removed]
If the car is titled under his name does that mean it‚Äôs his car now?
Would it be the DMV or the county tag office? Or are they the same in fl?
Definitely leaning towards that being the case. And I certainly hope it is!
"FWIW, I show up on my parents' cars on CreditKarma but my siblings (some of whom have driver's licenses and still live at that address) don't. They did add me to their insurance. Point is I wouldn't be certain that it's a routine thing because of address."
"Of course. The questions themselves weren‚Äôt the problem, but it was saying ‚Äúwe see a car was financed in your name, what company?‚Äù And I never have. I just wanted to bring it up, just in case it could be relevant. But I understand it‚Äôs a security precaution."
"Not only does the VIN number pull up directly as a 95, but looking at pictures of his car from our security camera side by side with pictures of the 95 and 93 online, it‚Äôs definitely the 95. "
It doesn‚Äôt say.

Same I think.

This is normal. Knowledge-based authentication systems will routinely ask ""trick questions"" like this.

Just pick the ""none of the above"" option."

"Inheriting a physical object is not the same as inheriting a copyright.  Given the informality of the situation, yes, they could definitely make a claim if these materials ended up having any material value.  You could argue that when they gave you the materials they gave you the copyrights; but that argument may or may not be accepted by a judge.

If your grandfather had a will, the copyrights and any proceeds from publishing would probably be distributed under its terms; if not, then according to CA intestate succession law, in which case the surviving spouse gets all community property and half separate property.  Whether these books are community or separate property depends on when they were written."
"> I would say that makes it ""mine"" in the same sense as inheriting any other physical object would be mine. If the possession they gave me ended up being of more value than they thought, I would imagine that it's their loss and something that should have been considered when handed to me.

Just to expand on u/UsuallySunny's answer: you do own the physical object. You can do whatever you want with it. Frame it, burn it, use the pages to decoupage your walls.

The physical object, however, isn't of any more value than they thought. If your grandfather becomes posthumously famous or something, it might become valuable, and then, yes, you could sell the physical object for bazillions and they would in fact be out of luck.

The problem is that it's unclear whether you own the copyright - which is, as the name implies, the right to make copies of the physical object (including publishing it). Copyright takes effect automatically once a work is put into tangible form - in other words, it doesn't matter whether your grandfather registered the copyright or not; the existence of the book is proof that it's copyrighted. Also, copyright outlasts the author: it holds for 70 years after the author's death. So the book is still copyrighted, and will be for another 60 years or so. Only it's unclear who owns the copyright."
"You made two big mistakes here.

1. You should have been one to call the police.  The bounce stole your ID.  Having the police called on you by the bar set you up for failure.
2. I understand why you probably thought you couldn't, but you actually can fly without ID.  You might have to answer a bunch of questions and/or be subjected to enhanced screening, but you can fly.  People lose their ID on vacation all the time."
"Your problem is going to be that the police sided with the bar not returning your ID and likely agreed that you were using someone else's ID. 

But certainly your can sue. I just don't know that you can win"
"This sounds fake. You can fly with no ID. They'll ask you questions and it takes longer to clear security. Next time someone steals your stuff YOU call the cops. If it actually happened, which I doubt. To me this reads more like you are pissed off at a bar and are testing a story. Also virtually no hotel charges $400 a night. Certainly not ones someone is staying in for one night for a job interview. "
"You can fly without ID even in this post 9/11 world. My sister and I went on vacation and she  bought our plane tickets. Never thought twice about it until the day we had to leave and I noticed that she had not only spelt my name wrong (missing a letter in my first some what uncommon name) she used my unmarried, maiden last name (she eventually realized that the save form feature on her browser filled in her last name - she has never been married)

Of course I don't have an ID that matches the ticket as I had been married for over 10 years at this point. Stupid fuckup, but I was still able to get on the plane after a longer security check (I had tons of other things in my possession with my name on them)

We just made sure we got to the airport extra early on the return flight to go through the process again."
Absolutely possible to fly without ID. A pain but possible. And with all the other docs you had and mention it wouldn't have even been that hard. Something seems amiss here. 
"I tried to fly without it. TSA wouldn‚Äôt let me because it wasn‚Äôt a lost ID, so there was no police report. "
But I have a photo ID that matches and confirms all the info. The police didn‚Äôt even get to handle the ID part because things between me and the bouncer escalated so they kept telling me to calm down and eventually told me to leave. 
"No hotel charges $400/night? While I doubt the legitimacy of this story that's not the reason why. Depending on the area, the time of year and the quality of the hotel $400/night isn't even that extreme. Hell, I'm paying $300 tomorrow night for a room at the Oregon Coast. "
"> You can fly with no ID.

This is not widely known. Also, for members of certain easily classifiable groups, attempting this is a very arduous ordeal. OP did not provide details that would indicate membership in such a class, but nevertheless it is not a good idea to attempt to fly without identification unless you have an emergency need, e.g. personal medical emergency or a dying loved one or some other incredibly timely thing."
Many hotels charge that much. During peak season (which this is) and events occurring (which is entirely possible) $400 USD a night is definitely plausible if everything else is booked.
You must be in a low cost if living area. $400 is normal in a lot of cities.
"I guess signing paperwork for a new hire on Sunday could happen, but it‚Äôs odd."
The hotel I work at is frequently over $400/night. We get single night business stays daily. 
"Virtually no hotel?? I can think of several off the top of my head that charge over $1000 a night. Doubt the validity of the story all you want, but let‚Äôs get a reality check on that, there are scads of hotels that charge $400+ a night."
"Hotels in certain places and on certain dates do charge 400+.

Source: I price hotel rooms for a living."
"I'm a former Marriott employee.  It is not unusual for a hotel room to cost $400 a night, depending on what city it is and if it's peak season.  I worked at a resort where some rooms reached $600/night."
What other documents would have worked?
"I‚Äôll second the you should have called the police immediately, rather than forcing the bar to. 
 
‚ÄúThey stole my legitimate ID‚Äù is a different call than ‚Äúwe have an unruly under aged customer unwilling to leave‚Äù. 
 
But, the TSA allows you to fly if your ID was simply ‚Äúleft at home‚Äù. They don‚Äôt need a police report to run an identity verification. Did you speak to a senior officer/CO, or just the standard agent? Do you have TSA pre or a passport? Did you speak with the airline customer service? Did you research flying without ID before you went to the airport?
 
Your recourse isn‚Äôt the job offer. It‚Äôs at most the cost of rebooking your flight to a later one. For JetBlue that‚Äôs $50 for a same-day flight. 
 
And for everyone else: when you‚Äôre traveling have 2 forms of ID. I fly with my passport and DL, my passport card stays home. "
"I'm calling shenanigans. You can fly without ID, regardless of why you don't have it. I've done it myself. Left for the airport then realized I completely forgot my wallet. I had zero identification on me. I had to go through a verification call (they pull your file then ask you questions about yourself) and a pat down but was able to go through security. The same process on the way home. This was just last year."
[removed]
"Did you go to the airport and attempt to go through the identity verification process?

">things between me and the bouncer escalated

This is your big mistake. You catch more flies with honey than with vinegar. Shoulda stayed calm and called the police yourself if they were being pig headed."
Stay at hotels constantly for work. A lot have a 48 hour or 72 hour cancel. $200 a night at 2 nights he missed very well could be $400.

"Except OP claims he did know that, and that he tried to fly and TSA wouldn't let him without a police report, which is BS.  This story is fictional."
[removed]
Normal for expensive hotels yes. But a guy making 65k a year is not going to be spending 400 a night on hotels.
"As is rescinding the offer unless he really blew that phone call. 
Talk to the bar owner and file small claims for the $"
"Especially if you want the room ""right now"""
"I'm calling shenanigans on the whole post based off this. They TSA views it as a hassle, not a roadblock. "
"Why do you even have a passport card if you have a full passport?  Is that not just a waste of money?

Srs question.  I am a novice traveller at best, and I'm always interested in how more experienced people do travelling."
Yeah he's clearly lying

"It was only an extra $30, even if they are mostly redundant. And it fits in a standard wallet. "
"You cannot use a passport card to enter most countries. It is for limited use for people who live near the borders to cross regularly and easily without an entire passport book. If you plan on traveling internationally you need a passport.  Someone who lives on a border may have both as one allows them to fly anywhere in the world, and the other is a convenient way to cross the US land borders. "
It doesn‚Äôt look like a police report is required. It certainly hasn‚Äôt been for me when I have flown without ID in the past either. Did the TSA attempt to confirm your identity and fail or did they reject your request before getting started for another reason?
"A police report is not required. You just need to go through a bit of extra theatre. Not that it helps you now, but you can absolutely fly without an ID. I‚Äôve done it. "
Who told you a police report was required - the airline or TSA?
"You can fly without an ID. You will just be subject to additional screening at the airport. 

A common reason why people fly without ID is because they left it at home, and there would obviously not be a police report for this."
[removed]
"Sorry dude, but you can definitely fly without an ID. I did it twice last year when I lost mine while traveling. Just had to tell TSA I lost it and they took extra time screening me. No other documentation was required."

"Yes, talk to a lawyer immediately."
Yes. Now. I would not have even spoken to the officer on the phone without contacting a lawyer. The cops are *not* your friend in this scenario. Call a lawyer immediately.
"I would also contact a bail bondsman and have one lined up so you can turn yourself in and walk right out. Some counties don‚Äôt set bonds every day, so double check with the bondsman or a lawyer about the right day and time to turn yourself in. Police might ask to speak with you, I wouldn‚Äôt do so without a lawyer. "

"getting details and all that stuff is fine, but I absolutely *never* trust the police unless I call them. Even then, it's not necessarily the best idea to trust they have your best interest in mind. My personal policy, and the advice i give to any friends of mine contacted by the police is to refuse to speak to them unless compelled by law. When compelled by law, have an attorney present. The *only* time i make an exception is when I witness an accident, and i stick around to fill out a witness statement in the police report so I can help the victim of the accident's attorney down the road as a witness if need be.

best of luck."

Title: **Terminating a contract from a client/scammer**

Original Post: 

> Hello all! I'm a freelance web developer, and I was recently contacted by a client who wanted me to design and build a website for his small business. After discussing some details and payment, I wrote up a contract. We both signed it via DocuSign. Recently, however, this client has revealed himself to be a scammer. No money has been exchanged, and none of the agreed upon work has been done. What do I need to do to void/terminate this contract?

What's your contract say about termination?
">Recently, however, this client has revealed himself to be a scammer.

How so?  Let me put this another way.  If you think that this ""prospective client"" is a scammer (for instance because they sent you a fake cashier's check), then what are you worried about?

Next time write up a contract that says you can terminate at any time for any reason and only charge for time spent on the project (or something like that)."
"The language of the custody agreement is going to be key here.  If you are caring for the child when your BF isn‚Äôt around and the agreement says that the other parent must have contact info for caregivers then it would seem like she would be entitled to that information.  

At the same time it‚Äôs not really your problem.  You are not bound by the court order as you are not a party.  However refusal would likely create issues, up to and including modification of the custody order and contempt if he fails to provide information she is entitled to.

Finally, if she is entitled to your contact info that doesn‚Äôt mean she has a right to call you or text you whenever just to annoy you.  That would still be harassment and you should make it clear that she is only to contact you if it relates to care of the child.  If she does it outside of that you can seek your own remedies against her which might include a no contact order if the harassment were to be aggressive enough and might actually backfire on her in future custody hearings."
Can you ask him to check the custody agreement (or have his lawyer do so) to see if her claims are even true?
Does the custody agreement state that he needs to give her the contact for caregivers?
Give er a texting app number that can be changed whenever you feel lol

"Their custody agreement is not your problem and doesn‚Äôt compel you to give it to her. Do you care for his kids when he‚Äôs working or otherwise not there? Then, he may be required to provide it, but really, she can continue to work through him to get updates, etc., right?"
"This is get a lawyer involved territory, the mental competence required to execute a will is pretty minimal in most cases, but the will must express his intentions and be executed of his own choosing.  You can probably get an attorney in short notice, it won‚Äôt be cheap, but you can do it.  Having the attorney do this reduces claims of undue influence and ensures that the proper formalities and other requirements are met."
Your father needs to talk to an attorney (even if they come to the hospital) to get his last wishes properly documented and legal.
">You can probably get an attorney in short notice, it won‚Äôt be cheap, but you can do it.

The father should be the one getting the attorney, not the OP.  There may be an angle for the ""scumbag brother"" to contest the will if the drafting of it was overseen by a lawyer provided by OP, rather than one attained by the father himself.

Which make this even more difficult, since it seems like the father isn't in a great state to retain his own lawyer."
"Right, my response wasn‚Äôt a model of clarity, that‚Äôs what I was trying to suggest, dad gets the attorney to help."

Title: **Physical altercation with an intruder (IN)?**

Original Post: 

> I was at my best friends house when he had someone knock at the door asking for him to step outside and talk. Over what? I have no clue, not my business. My friend came back inside and told the visitor to leave and to stop harassing him then slammed the door closed. The man left then returned and opened the door about 3 minutes later; entered, screaming and ready to fight. My friend just had a spine surgery 5 months ago, has both hips replaced, and just beat cancer so it's safe to say he's not physically able to defend himself and I knew this so I jumped up, fended the man off, and was able to wrestle him outside while my friends wife locked the door behind me as I yelled for her to do so. Me and the man fought for about 2 or so minutes. He got winded and a pretty hard hit or two to the jaw got in his truck and left. My question is if I am able to wrestle a person out of a home they are not allowed in and a fight continues does that still count as defending a home? The home is in town and when stepping into the street you are immediately on public grounds. Also am I allowed to defend **another** persons home or do I have to stand aside unless it gets deadly?

Yes you will have an arrangement where you can enter a plea of not guilty and ask for a public defender. That note means it hasn't happened yet. 
"Thanks for the feedback.

Should I use a public defender?  I've read they basically don't have time to do much for anyone.  For something as small as this, would I be able to get a 'private'(?) attorney for a reasonable rate?"
"Ahhh, that would make sense, thank you.

I was pretty straightforward with the police about what we were doing and why we were there, not to mention they have body camera footage of us coming out of the building towards them; would there be potential benefit in entering a plea of not guilty?  Also, would there be a chance of being offered a plea bargain of some kind of infraction/citation of a lesser offense?

I apologize if these are basic questions, I have no experience with the justice system."
If you can afford your own attorney you likely will not qualify for a PD. But they are attorneys and often get a bad rep.
"Your lack of criminal history is a good factor that could help getting a favorable plea deal. However, confessing to the police makes making a defense harder. Do not talk to the police or the building owner about this again without talking to your lawyer about it first. "
You plead not guilty because number one you need to consult with an attorney and number two precisely because you hope a plea deal is offered. If you plead guilty it's over. You get sentenced and your goal of not having a criminal record is out the window.
"I have relatively low income, though above the poverty line.  I'm good at managing money so I could afford an attorney but may opt to not if it were to cost thousands.  But I may still qualify for a public defender if that's a better choice."
"Thank you for the advice.  This is very helpful.

Is it reasonable to believe I may be able to get a lawyer for only a few hundred dollars for a case like this?  And should I get in contact with a lawyer before the arraignment?"
This is very direct and concise advice.  Thank you very much for the feedback.
"A few hundred for the entire case? No. Call around and get quotes. If you really can't afford an attorney, that's what public defenders are for."
"Thank you, and I apologize for my ignorance.  This seems pretty cut and dry and I think the only thing they would need to do is try to get a plea bargain with the prosecutor.  It doesn't seem like something many hours would go into, but again, I am very ignorant as to what this job would entail and how charges would work beyond an hourly rate."
A ‚Äúprivate‚Äù attorney is most definitely going to cost you more than a few hundred dollars. The hourly rate is likely several hundred per hour.  
"Thanks for the clarification.

I know their rates are in the hundreds per hour, but I'm ignorant to everything related to lawyers and don't see many hours going into this.  It seems like a very straight forward case that would require nothing more than a negotiation between an attorney and a prosecutor.  There may be more that goes into it than that, but I'm unaware of everything their job entails."
What does your contract say about subbing out flowers that might not be available or at reasonable market? What does your contract say generally about refunds?
"It says they reserve the right to substitute flowers without prior consent, does not make any mention of objects like swapping out crystals.  That would be the only thing that was incorrectly ""swapped.""  The rest of the contract errors were either something was just set up incorrectly or missing.  "

Title: **Copywritten Music on non profit answer machine**

"To do this legally in the vast majority of cases, you need to pay a Performance Rights Organization (PRO) for a license for ""music on hold."" There are three major PROs in the US: BMI, ASCAP and SESAC, ordered according to size from biggest to smallest. Each has a different catalog and you need to pay separate fees to each if your music choices come from different PRO catalogs. You may have to pay the license fee to one, two or all three, depending on the artists you play. 

Alternatively, if the recording is very old and in the public domain, then you can play it without a license. "
"You need the appropriate license(s) to play music on hold (or as part of your answering machine messages). It's considered a 'public performance' when you stream or deliver music over a telephone system, so the copyright holder has the right to demand payment in connection with that 'performance' of their music.

It's actually more complicated than it sounds because in the US there are multiple agencies that deal with public performance licensing. The three major ones are ASCAP, BMI, and SESAC. And generally you need licenses from all 3 agencies to play commercial music over a telephone system since different songs are registered with different agencies. You may also be required to acquire the appropriate neighboring rights (for the rights to broadcast the sound recordings of the music) from an agency like SoundExchange.

The simpler option is to look into royalty-free music so you don't have to worry about paying annual license fees to the various performance rights agencies. Incompetech (for example) has a large selection of royalty-free music and they charge just a one-time fee of $95 to use any song(s)/recording(s) in their library on a telephone system."
To do so for free you might look at a site that offers music recordings that have been put into the public domain such as [Musopen](https://musopen.org).  Only works if you can find one with the type of music you are seeking though.
"Just buy a 'tape' of hold music from a telephony vendor. They've already cleared all the rights you require (ASCAP, Harry Fox, etc) to use the music. "
[removed]
It should be noted that not all the recordings available on Musopen are dedicated to the public domain. Some of the recordings are released under a CC-BY or similar license which would require OP to provide credit/attribution (i.e. announce to the caller that the song was recorded/performed by X and explain that the song is used under a CC license).

> I want to preface this post with the fact that I am currently 18 years old, and there is a lot of information that might be missing from this post but I will try to provide as much information that I know as possible. 
> 
> So currently my mother is in the hospital for a host of different reasons but main reason is because she was having a lot of bloating in her stomach and it turns out that she has stage four liver disease. There are many what-ifs and many of the doctors and nurses are hopeful, but there is a good possibility that my mother might pass. But, this isn't your ordinary, my mother is passing and I need advice, as there are are many complexities surrounding this story. 
> 
> So, before my mother was admitted to the hospital, she was planning on declaring bankruptcy. She had already talked with a lawyer and things were about to get started until she ended up in the hospital. Due to her present state, the lawyer thought it wouldn't be wise to go through with the bankruptcy. She is currently about 50,000 dollars in debt. 
> 
> So with all the turmoil happening with her health and the creditors, my grandparents decide to have a power of attourney signed so that they could make some decisions regarding how her money should be handled. I should also mention, that while my mother did sign the document, she was heavily drugged during the process and didn't really know what was happening. After it was signed I asked her if she read it and if she knew what she signed, and she said that she signed a foreclosure document, so it is extremely obvious that she didn't quite know what was going on. I also think it is particularly odd that they were so quick to get a lawyer in the first place, as they were able to have a power of attorney signed within two days of my mother being admitted to the hospital, but nevertheless they do have legal right to make financial decisions currently. 
> 
> They have signed her house over to them and have made plans to sign the car over into their name as well. I guess my big question is how do I protect my mothers possessions? They are already talking about selling her car, house, and possessions and I do not think they have that right to do so. Especially considering the fact that there is a chance that she will be able to leave the hospital and try to have a normal life. Today they asked for keys to both the home and the car, and I don't know how to protect those from being sold. I agree that once she is out of the hospital, the house should be sold, but I don't think it should be done until she is out of the hospital.  Do they have a legal right to go through my mothers things and sell what they want? If they sell it what is my legal right to the money that is gained? How should that money be handled (i.e. put into a checkings account under my name, etc) ? Should I be worried that my grandparents are trying to pull something (like not give me money that would rightfully be mine if she had not signed the power of attorney)? Should I get a lawyer? 
> 
> Thank you so much for your help, I am going through a lot right now and I really need some advice. I am so young and there are a lot of things I don't completely understand so it would be nice to have someone elaborate and give me guidance.

Second, it really depends on whether a reasonable third party observer, in the same situation, would consider it a threat of bodily harm. As others have stated - if he grabbed a nugget and charged you, or backed you into a corner, or had a history of threats (and making good on them), etc.

Finally, if you think it was a credible threat, file a police report and let the cops worry about it."

He was drunk and yelling at me and my coworkers.  He was like 5 feet away and the chicken nuggets were on the counter. 
ok ill talk to the general manager thanks
"Someone asked you TWO comments down:

Did you fear he would actually do it?

> not really because its so dumb but you never know with him

You either thought he would do it or not. Pick one. It's quite obvious that you do not think he's going to shove a chicken nugget up your ass. 

It sounds like from your inability to give a straight answer for a state of being of yourself that you may also have been drunk. 

From your answers here this does not appear to be assault. He possibly is creating a hostile work environment for you, but until you can give us a straight answer it's going to be very difficult to determine."
Report it to the person above your supervisor. 
Did he have a nug in his hand? Was he forcefully gesticulating (either with the nug or with his beer hand to pull down your pants)?
then there's no assault if you did not think it was really going to happen
[removed]
"The details you've posted suggests no assault.

If he was closer to you with nugget in hand when he made the threat, that would be a stronger argument for assault."
No i wasn't drunk at all.  i didnt think he would literally do what he said but he might have done something violent
He didnt have it in his hand but they were there on the counter.  I dont know what gesticulating means.

Since it is your insurance contacting you and not the police or other party, it is unlikely that it will do more than costing you an increase in premiums or getting dropped by your insurance company and needing to find a high-risk insurance (with a correspondingly higher premium). 

Your insurance is going to assume, if you didn‚Äôt report the accident, that you were drunk or high when it happened. Or that you are just a wildly irresponsible person. None of those makes companies want to insure you.

Showing up to your home isn‚Äôt a that big of a deal. Showing up at your work may cost you your job or your employer‚Äôs belief that you are trustworthy. I highly recommend showing up, taking your lumps, and learning from the experience."
"What did you hit? And do you know how the insurance company found out about the accident? If the insurance company knows about what happened then the police almost certainly know too. You need to contact the insurance company immediately.

"This is an emotional situation, and I'm sorry.

First, check with the county court house where the divorce was filed.  You'll need that information anyway if you intend to pursue permanent residency.  Get a copy of the whole case file.  You are divorced.  You signed.  It's over.

Second, it is not the end of the world.  You can still petition for permanent residency on your own.  As long as your marriage was not entered into in bad faith, you have a good shot.  It is best to have an attorney, but not completely necessary.  You can do all the paperwork on your own.  Be sure immigration has your correct address so they will send you the notice when it is time to apply (should be sometime in December I believe and cost about $1000)."
Why wouldn‚Äôt you sign? It‚Äôs pretty clear it wasn‚Äôt working out.

"[This](https://www.mass.gov/locations/worcester-probate-and-family-court) is the court where it is filed. But there is nobody I know there who could get the information about the status. What should I do to get the information?

">And additionally, how do I file for permanent on my own? Marriage didn't enter bad faith, but maybe I don't have a case for that it didn't because we never went for marriage counseling despite my efforts (I don't know if that matters).

The form you have to file is [Form 751](https://www.uscis.gov/i-751).  There's a box on the first page that you check.  It says something like 'I entered my marriage in good faith but it was terminated by divorce'.  You'll need to send a copy of the final order of divorce in order to prove that you *are* divorced, and other documents (eg financial records) to show that you and your wife lived together, mingled finances, etc, while married.

(There's also a strict time limit for when you *must* file by.  Read the instructions.)

'Bad faith', in immigration, means 'this was never a real marriage - it was just on paper to get a green card'.  It doesn't refer to situations where you started in a real marriage but one or the other of you gave up on the marriage afterwards.  Lack of marriage counseling doesn't disqualify you."
"Yes, [Statute 509](http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&URL=0500-0599/0509/0509.html) covers short term rentals. 

30 days may not be the hard line for a vacation rental, and you may have the right to lock them out. But I would absolutely get a consultation with a landlord/tenant lawyer before doing anything here."
"You should talk to a lawyer.  My parents run a vacation rental, and I'm told that FL law is generally favorable to you.  I believe that a proper license as a vacation rental gives you a legal exemption to the 30 day residency rule that is common in other jurisdictions.

Basically, you should be safe if you get a lawyer to tell you the right licenses and/or practices you need to maintain status as a temporary rental as opposed to a residence."

He shares some responsibility as he has not adequately fenced his ducks (I presume).  What prevents coyotes or other random dogs from attacking his ducks?  Perhaps to avoid acrimony with the neighbor, point that out and offer to pay half (if you have some belief your dog could have done it).

"#SON. OF. A. BITCH.

;-)

Thanks."
"You can reject any offer you want, and having a shitty lender is a perfectly good reason to get rejected."
What reason specifically do not like the lender? Seems like an odd reason to reject a full price offer. Just curious
"Some lenders can be a nuisance through closing - demanding this or that from the seller, etc... 

Also, there are some markets where the asking price is more of a floor than a ceiling. (I don't know if Cupertino is still like that, but it was a decade ago)."
Are your kids named on the lease as lessees? 
I think you need an attorney to respond to this who knows tenant/landlord California law. 
"If your son is on the lease with you, he is probably ""jointly and severally"" responsible for all of the rent, so the lease is not affected by your death.   There is no lease-breaking provision in California for a person who is going into hospice or who dies.

Is there a specific early-termination penalty in the lease itself, or do you get the $4000 amount from a forfeited deposit ?

In general, landlords in California are required to ""mitigate damages"" by re-renting the apartment as soon as they can.   They can't just leave it empty and try to collect rent from your son and/or your estate.

Since your son is on the lease with you, he can choose to continue to occupy the apartment, or sublet it (if allowed in the lease) or break the lease and allow the landlord to pursue him for his losses.   Many landlords would prefer to negotiate with a living person for a smaller payment and mutual agreement, than to sue an estate or an out-of-state person, and risk getting nothing.

.  
.

Fuck cancer."
My son is named as lessee but daughter is not.
"So what has he actually recently? Not what he did when they were together, or what she fears he might do, but what he has actually done."
"So this is all post-break up. At one point he confronted her at her job to the point that he was trespassed from the premises, in another incident he made a scene at a local restaurant to scream and yell at her that she was a whore to the point that the manager of the restaurant called the police and reported the incident (this is one of the police reports). He's threatened to take their child and disappear. More recently he's sent threatening messages to her sister and parents that he'd come to their home and hurt them if she didn't come back to him. He also manages to find a workaround to getting into contact with her so he can attempt to threaten her. 

It's also worth mentioning that he's an allegedly recovering meth addict. Though his behavior seems to indicate otherwise, at least to me, though I know that my own assumptions are pretty worthless without proof."
So my advice would be to gather all the police reports and get a restraining order on him and request full custody. Assuming that he is not of sound mind then also advise the schools that he is not to pick up your SO‚Äôs child (assuming you got full custody and RO). Also assuming that you got both of those taken care of report him on any RO violations.
"Fair enough. 

There is one last thing that I forgot to mention in the original post that I may edit to include. Her daughters last name is his as basically a peace offering to avoid further conflict, but she's been trying to figure out the method in which to change it without further retaliation from him. 

Mostly so that she can travel with her, and get her daughter a passport. I'm not too clear on the laws there as far as that goes. She doesn't want to have her exe's permission to be able to travel outside the country with her daughter just because they share different surnames."
Honestly I think you can get you children passports from only 1 parent. Meaning she shouldn‚Äôt worry about the passport but the last name change is through a court and I believe after a certain age it is up to the child. A RO is a good thing to start off with if you are going to court to change the name.
"Generally speaking, the legal system will only compensate you for any actual damages that you‚Äôve suffered. As much as it sucks, not being able to live with your desired roommate isn‚Äôt a damage.

Assuming that you can convince a judge that you‚Äôve signed a valid lease and the university is failing to honor it, they would be liable for any costs which result from that. In this case, that would likely be any extra cost required to obtain comparable housing elsewhere."
Many universities have a free legal clinic that help students.  Contact them and see what they can help with.

Title: **Was set to live in an apartment with a friend for the upcoming school year but the apartment manager never ‚Äústamped‚Äù the lease after I signed it. Now, my friend is locked in with someone he doesn‚Äôt know and I do not have a place to live. Anything I can do?**

Original Post: 

> Excuse me if this is the wrong place to ask but a friend suggested I ask in this sub.
> 
> To give some background info...
> My friend and I have already been living in this apartment complex for a year but thought we should double up to make it cheaper for this upcoming school year. We are both university undergrads. Months ago we went into the office and requested to live together and so we got the agreements and everything signed and sent them back in. From there we were told everything was good to go. Not long after,  we went in to the office again to mention that when signing the documents we weren‚Äôt asked to put one another down as roommates for the next year. So we told them and they said ok - asked for our names and that they will add it to our accounts. My friend recently got an email stating his room number for next year as well as transfer information. I only received an email giving me move-out details so I called the office. 
> They were very confused at first but figured out that after I turned the lease in months ago, the manager, for whatever reason, never stamped the my signed lease therefore I was ‚Äòlost in the system.‚Äô I have the confirmation of when I signed and a time stamp of when the lease was sent in as well as a copy of it. As of right now I am not living here again next year but my friend is locked in to be with a random roommate instead of myself. They are fully booked for next year and their policy is to lease by bedroom hence why they added in a random roommate without my friend knowing. 
> This is very frustrating as school is set to start soon and now I‚Äôll probably have to pay for a storage locker as move out people have to leave early on top of the only places to live left are much more expensive. 
> 
> The administration has been incompetent and unclear from the beginning in dozens of ways ever since it opened a year ago and this is the last straw. They said it‚Äôs entirely their fault but did not say anything else effectively leaving me stranded and my planned roommate stuck in the agreement. 
> 
> Many people I‚Äôve spoken about this issue to have said to sue, but I really don‚Äôt know much on that end. 
> So I was wondering if anyone can please let me know if I could do anything about this!

Your scenario sounds like sudden and accidental failure of plumbing, which is typically covered (sometimes with some exceptions, like if you turn off your heat and your pipes freeze). 

Typically first-party coverages do not cover flooding, even including many man-made scenarios. It's an optional extra you have to purchase from the NFIP. But flooding is often defined in such a way that might not include this scenario.

It doesn't seem clearcut to me without having read his policy text. Might be covered, might not be. However, if neighbor has liability insurance, that should still cover it. There aren't nearly as many exclusions on liability coverage.

No
Probably not.  Disney has copyrights on all their characters.
"[maybe](https://info.legalzoom.com/legal-use-disney-characters-21231.html)

You can contact Disney directly and inquire from there. Disney is known to take the property of others and claim it as theirs. If you look at the legal zoom link above, it references an instance where Disney sued the Oscars for using [Snow White](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/oscars-rob-lowes-snow-white-422225).

In this case, its clear that the Oscars did use the cartoon version of a 19th century fairy tale, which Disney cannot own the rights to. They can own the rights to their version of white sleeves, blue top, yellow skirt, black hair, etc. that would clearly be recognizable as a ""Disney"" princess.

The original [Snow White](https://www.pitt.edu/~dash/grimm053.html) had seven dwarfs. You could use your interpretation of drawing Snow White, seven little people, but you couldn't call them Sleepy, Sleazy, etc without infringing on Disney's copyright.

For the blatant ""No"" reply you got: Fair use comes into play with satire. That is how Mad Magazine is able to use Star Trek as [Star Blechh](https://trekkerscrapbook.com/2012/12/07/the-daily-scrapbook-12712-star-bleeech-the-original-mad-magazine-parody/) without being sued AND being able to sell magazines. Mad Magazine sells exact [likenesses](http://planetoddity.com/mad-magazines-good-old-covers/).

So TLDR; it is entirely possible, but there are restrictions. Even using something like ""Iron Man"" is fair play, as Black Sabbath wrote the song with that title, and later it was used in the movie because the song was iconic, though it had nothing to do with the Marvel (now Disney) version of Iron Man. Tread carefully and contact a real lawyer before going further in the endeavor. Good luck!"
Wouldn't it fall under fair use though?
"I don‚Äôt think so. If you drew Iron Man, I‚Äôm not sure you could slap that on a shirt and sell it without infringing Disney‚Äôs copyright on the character.

What part of fair use do you think it falls under?"
"No, that is just pure copyright violation.  And, I'm assuming you intend to sell these, which means you are using it commercially.  "
Of course not.  Why would you think that?
Same thing Ready Player One used (the book). But Im no copyright lawyer that's why I asked
"It's not the same thing.  Fair use would, in the case of the book Ready Player One, allow the author to make references to or otherwise use/allude to the copyrighted characters *in a limited fashion.*  None of the main characters in the book are copyrighted by Disney.  It would generally not be copyright infringement to describe a character in a scene reading an Iron Man comic book, but it would probably be copyright infringement to make Tony Stark a major part of the story.

You want to make a copyrighted character the main subject of a t-shirt.  That's different.

The question as to whether it would infringe Disney's copyright is likely going to come down to how transformative your work is.  If it's just a stylized rendition of a copyrighted character, that may not be transformative enough to consider it a derivative work."
It is very transformative  but maybe I should just try and and let Disney kill me and my family. 
"The attorney in the case is the best person to ask about this, as they will have their particular strategy in mind already, which could involve family/friends being present or writing letters of support. Further, they are probably familiar with the person the hearing is in front of, who may have some preferences regarding this sort of thing, and may or may not be likely to be swayed by people showing up. Usually, it's not a bad idea to have family/close friends present, but I'm not certain about community members who don't know the defendant. "

I'm afraid the news is probably not good. The Judge can't just decide these creditors don't have a claim if they have a claim. They don't have that authority.

Importantly, the interest rate has to be at least the ""applicable federal rate"" published by IRS, and based on whether loan is short-, mid-, or long-term. I assume your loan will be long-term (more than nine years). Mid-term is more than three, less than nine years. July 2018 long-term rate is 3.06&#37;.

^(I'm not an attorney or tax/accounting professional.)"
"Thanks for your advice. Just to make sure I'm reading that chart correctly and understanding. We are actually looking to pay back in 5-6 years, so probably a mid-term loan. So in that case, the interest rate would have to above 2.87% according to that site. Is that true for the loan in perpetuity just based on the starting month of the loan if its fixed rate? Like you don't have to come back every month and check that site to make sure its still in compliance if those numbers have changed month to month? 

Thanks again."
"Yes, 2.87&#37; for mid-term. [Direct Link to IRS publication of AFRs](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/rr-18-19.pdf).

Good question. If the loan is a ""fixed term"" loan (vs. a ""demand"" loan), the rate is established based on AFRs at time loan is consummated. Demand loans, because no fixed maturity, require interest rate to be re-established periodically.

Read this: [Important Considerations in Intra-Family Loans. ](http://www.willamette.com/insights_journal/14/autumn_2014_2.pdf)Most is boring; some applicable to you; see page 7 for full context of section quoted below; from a financial planning publication, written by two attorneys in the field (bold emphasis is mine). This speaks to ability to set the rate for duration of the loan *if a fixed term loan.* Uses long-term rate/loan as example, but applies to mid-term loan also. The key: must be ""fixed term,"" and not a ""demand"" loan.

>Because  mid-term  and  long-term  AFRs  are  currently  near  historical  lows,  demand  loans  are  currently  less  appealing  than  loans  with  a  fixed  term because of the risk that rates will rise and **the ability to ‚Äúlock in‚Äù a low rate by setting a fixed term**. It is important  to  note  that  the  long-term rate can be used for any  term loan greater than nine years. Accordingly, **a loan could be made for a 30-year term, for example, using the long-term AFR.**

Are you sure the consulate doesn't offer translation services? Could they hire a translator to go with them?
"Have you emailed or called the Venezuelan embassy or consulate to ask how to do this? If they could do this in yhe country, perhaps they could do it here too.  Or could they call you when they‚Äôre at the embassy and you translate between the two. 



Another option is to reach out to Chinese-speaking (mandarin) associations in the same city as the embassy/consulate and find out if they know of any affordable translation services.  Google for immigrant assistance in that city as well. 


IANAL"
"It would be interesting to hear the story on how someone has Venezuelan citizenship without speaking a lick of Spanish. But that's beyond the point. IANAL, but I'm Venezuelan, and I can tell you their options are not great:

1. It is currently nearly impossible to renew a Venezuelan password. The country is more impoverished than ever and materials to make them are scarce. If they do try to renew, appointments are taking 9-12 months on average (that's to go to a consulate for the first steps). The government created a new ""passport extension"" (prorroga in Spanish, it adds 2 years to the expiration date) sticker that may be easier to obtain, but they need to be newer passports (with chips) and you can  apply only through this website in Spanish: https://tramites.saime.gob.ve/.

2. Consulates are not particularly helpful these days and a lot of times they speak broken English, but look here, find the one that's closer to you, and give them a call, maybe you'll get lucky: http://www.embavenez-us.org/index.php?pagina=pag_consular_services_office.php&titulo=Consular%20Offices

3. There are many interpreter services out there, although the offerings may be limited for Mandarin to Spanish. People usually take them to immigration appointments without issue.

4. The less difficult route would be obtaining US citizenship for the passport, but that is also taking several months right now and they would need to speak at least some basic English to pass the citizenship test. "
Haven't looked into that yet.  I'm sure they wouldn't be able to afford that though.
Thanks.  Several members of our family have tried to get in touch with the Consulate on several occasions and nobody can get them to answer the phone.  I'll look into translation services though.

"Most consulates won't pick up the phone.  They're understaffed.  Have you tried emailing them?  Also, in many cases, it's faster to email the embassy in the capital and then they can assist.

Please note that the embassy/consulate can be very strict with paperwork.  Some of it might be even arcane.  But usually, at least for the US, much of the paperwork and process are required.  Sometimes people are forced to come back 2-3x.  And it's not deliberate.

Internet broadcasts are generally not governed by the same rules as TV. 
"As far as I'm aware, services like Netflix and CraveTV are not required to include closed captions or follow other CRTC broadcast regulations because they are classified as ""Over The Top"" (OTT) services rather than ""Broadcast Distribution Undertakings"" (BDUs).

OTT refers to services which are delivered to you over your existing internet connection (regardless of who your ISP is), and for the most part these services are not regulated by the CRTC (although that is subject to change in the future). This is in contrast to ISP-provided cable, satellite, or IP-based television systems which are delivered through a closed/proprietary network directly to consumers‚Äîthese services are regulated as BDUs and have to follow many regulatory requirements, including closed captioning requirements.

If I recall correctly, the US now has a regulation in place that basically says television broadcasters have to provide closed captioning when they distribute programming online such as through video streaming services (if the programming was previously aired on their TV channel). However, I don't believe Canada has an equivalent regulatory requirement as of yet."
"At this time, CRTC is only monitoring the situation.

https://crtc.gc.ca/eng/INFO_SHT/b321.htm"
"I wonder how we as the public can force that issue without giving the CRTC oversight of the internet (stuff like CanCon rules suck).

It's a Pandoras box. I, a hard of hearing individual, would like to watch a show I cannot see on any other platform because they won't sell it to a higher quality platform like Xbox video. But I don't want more powers for the CRTC, which usually works in the interest of telecom companies because they won't enforce their own rules.

Thank you for your write up. I appreciate it."
"Yeah, it's a tricky situation. If you get the CRTC involved, then it probably means new CanCon regulatory requirements for any video-streaming platform (possibly even sites like YouTube) which I think both you and I can see would be a bad idea. 

Even as it stands now, there are talks about forcing streaming services like Netflix to adopt CanCon requirements or there is the possibility of a so-called ""Netflix tax"" that may be introduced to help fund CanCon projects if OTT providers like Netflix don't agree to CanCon rules.

It'll be interesting to see what happens over the next couple of years.

One thing I wanted to ask‚Äîhave you considered possible alternatives such as VMedia?

VMedia is an ISP and IPTV BDU which services various regions throughout Canada. They have TV packages for as low as $22/month and internet packages for as low as $40/month. VMedia also has a VCloud TV service which is basically like a 24/7 cloud PVR for all the major TV channels so you basically get on-demand access to any programming that has aired in the last 7 days (on ~25 channels).

Since IPTV services like VMedia are classified as BDUs, they're supposed to comply with all the CRTC regulations regarding closed captioning accessibility etc. although I personally don't know how effective and reliable their closed captioning system is."
They can claim they owe you a million billions dollars that doesn't mean you do.  Other than they application fee what are they claiming this is for?

"Absent a court order yes, she can deny him access to the child. He needs to file for custody"
He needs to figure out how to hire an attorney somehow. Her new stud can't adopt the child unless your friend's parental rights are terminated by the court. His ex can't do that all by herself just because she wants to. 
"Were they married when the child was born? Is he on the birth certificate?

She is completely unable to change her daughters last name and have someone adopt her without his consent. Which he never should no matter what unless he wants to lose all rights to his child. She may start tactics like ‚Äúthen she can go on his insurance‚Äù or something like. I understand that money may be an issue with lawyers. Does your friend have a resource through his work that may offer lawyer assistance? Or perhaps look around for someone on a sliding scale. "
"He needs to get an attorney, go to court, and get a custody order.

There's really nothing else.  That's it."
"That answers a question I did not have, but thank you. "
Thank you! That's what I thought.
"Yes, they were married, and he is on the birth certificate. We have been looking for a lawyer who will agree to work at a decent rate without requiring a retainer. Unfortunately thew few consultations he has had so far, while having an affordable hourly rate, required a $2000 retainer which he cannot afford. "
[deleted]
Can he perhaps get a credit card to put the retainer on? Not ideal but when talking about your kid might be worth it. 
">He has a generic 50/50 custody order I believe. 

You originally said:

> The current custody arrangement (which I believe is by agreement, not court order)

Those are two different things.  In any event, if there is a custody order, no, she can't change it anytime she wants.

>They have been talking about ex-best friend adopting his daughter and having her last name changed to ex-best friend's last name. He refuses to consent, but she is under the belief that she doesn't need his consent.

She's wrong.  Again, he needs a lawyer.

> parents being able to see their grand daughter?

It depends if there is a court order, and what it says."
If the child receives government assistance the state will go after the non-custodial parent to recoup costs
"Generally, the state has an interest in ensuring that parents pay for their children whenever possible as opposed to passing the cost on to everyone else. If you receive public assistance of any sort, the state will attempt to collect child support to offset (in part) the cost of the assistance. Medicaid is public assistance. You cannot stop the court from trying to collect back what it pays out on your behalf."
"My understanding, at least from my own experience is that if you're receiving state assistance is it mandatory to have a support order in place. I already had one with my ex, but when you apply for and receive services it is required. They want to make sure that all needs are being met, and any money that could be available to pay for medical bills etc is being collected. 

If there was a reason to not, ex. Abusive spouse etc, you would have to be able to prove that. 

In ND if you're on assistance, they automatically go after child support and do garnishment on paychecks for the non-custodial parent. "
But we're both custodial parents? 
"So MA hasn't been used for him, ive had it less than a year and as I said he does have good insurance through his dad. So there shouldn't be anything to ""recoup"" Can I just take him off MA? "
"Why do you have govt insurance for a child that has insurance? Why does society need to pay for him to have dual insurance? That isnt what it is there for

But that is what the father needs to help pay for. "
"Yes there is.  Premiums.  Just because you haven't used any of it doesn't mean there aren't costs involved.  And yea, if the kid already has insurance and you're both earning enough income, I don't understand why you're collecting Medicaid benefits anyway.  Seriously, why did you sign him up for Medicaid when he has insurance?"
"I had to get it for myself. The site was asking all my information, asked if I had dependents etc. When I spoke to the person helping me get signed up she said it wouldn't be a bad idea to have it as a back up for my son too. In case his dads insurance didnt cover everything or stopped for any reason. "
Well that is what he is paying for then. That is really uncommon. Call whomever is trying for get support from him and ask how to fix it
How does a water company run an HOA? Sounds fishy 
"This website might give you some useful information.  In most states contacting the public utilities commission is usually the most appropriate way to complain about utility companies.  

https://www.utc.wa.gov/consumers/Pages/whenToCallTheCommission.aspx"
"**edit**: OP, is she a tenant of the HOA?

~~It‚Äôs illegal for landlords in WA state to turn off utilities for any reason other than making repairs.~~

~~NAL, but it might be a good idea to document that if the water service gets turned off, she expects $100 per day for each day without water, under the law. Send it certified to both the HOA and the water company. While the HOA is her landlord, they‚Äôre owned by the water company and it could be reasonably argued that the water company is also her landlord.~~"
"They owned the land and created the HOA and started selling the land to homeowners on the condition they follow whatever HOA bylines they decide.

Edit: she owns her own land and property."
"Page explicitly states in the water section, ""UTC does not regulate HOA's"""
"Is she a tenant? Because that section specifically applies to landlord tenant relationships. 

It also matters what fees and fines she‚Äôs racking up. If the water utility controls the HOA I could easily see this being over paying for water, and the utility can absolutely turn off your water for not paying the bill.
"
"I updated the original post.

She owns her land. She owns her property.

The HOA and water utility company are separate entities that were founded by the same people, but work together."
"Has it been since separated out? Usually once the units/homes/lots are all sold the developer turns the HOA over to the members.

This situation is really weird and we don‚Äôt have a clear picture of what is going in but I would love to see an update after the hearing."
"Some HOA's might provide water to their members.  That might be what that means.  But a water company selling real estate and establishing an HOA might not be the same thing.  The distinction between those two can be confusing and probably needs to be made clear in any phone calls or anything.  

If she can't afford a lawyer she might want to contact Legal Aid.  Even if they can't represent her they might be able to give her advice.  

In any case, be sure she takes plenty of evidence to small claims court Thursday.  Such as evidence of the threat to cut off her water for non compliance with HOA rules.  

Also she should be clear about her reasons for not complying with the HOA rules, as that might turn out to be a key issue in court, even if it shouldn't be.  
"
"Good point that we don‚Äôt have enough information to assume she‚Äôs renting. 

But we also don‚Äôt have enough information to assume she isn‚Äôt paying the water bill. "
"I updated the original post.

She owns her land. She owns her property.

The HOA and water utility company are separate entities that were founded by the same people, but work together."
"It might be time to lawyer up if she has the resources. The water company so intertwined with an HOA sounds like it should be illegal for this very reason, but a professional would be able to give a better answer than reddit. "
"I updated original post.

They HOA and water utility company were founded by the same people and they work together."
Maybe you should find out before confidently quoting a probably inapplicable section and telling OP to confidently go to war against a water utility that almost certainly has a professional legal department and experience in this area?
Do you mind if I ask where you are in WA?
Small claims disallow lawyers apparently.
"> it might be a good idea 

> it could be reasonably argued

> NAL

She *could be* a renter and therefore the water company *might be* trying to break the law. I don‚Äôt know what crawled up your ass today but try giving the OP helpful advice rather than coming after me. "
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupeville,_Washington

Is where this is going down."
"While you‚Äôre right, it sounds like the small claims case is about her HOA fines and not the threat from the water company. Unless the HOA fines are because of her not paying the bill. There‚Äôs a lot missing in the OP. 

Either way, she can consult with a lawyer to explain the law without having one represent her. "
"The issue she is incurring fines for is separate from the water bill and is an ongoing dispute. The threat of water shut-off is arbitrarily being applied for not paying the fines on her HOA dispute.

That's why I'm here asking for legal recourse. She can't really afford a lawyer."
Gotcha. I would try finding a lawyer who does free initial consults. They‚Äôre rare but it means she gets a professional opinion and she‚Äôs not locked into having them represent her. 
Get a different lawyer.
"Trust your gut feelings. The field is too crowded to not have an attorney you at least feel comfortable with, and who has *your* best interests at heart. Ask for recommendation from coworkers or friends."
"As others have said, if you're uncomfortable, get a different lawyer. I'll just add that if your ex has his own lawyer, then your lawyer should definitely not be talking to him directly.
