# reddit-depression-classification
Classifies Reddit comment data to see whether depressed or not. 
Collected 50,000 comments from the Reddit PRAW API from mental health subreddits. Used NLTK and Scikitlearn to remove stop words, lemmantize, and tokenize the comments. Graphing is done using wordcloud and matplotlib, and Naives bayes and logistical regression models are used to predict with 80% accuracy.
